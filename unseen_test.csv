1,"These pumpkin seeds were so yummy. At first I thought they were too small, but I was wrong. They are the perfect size. They come in 4-oz bags which makes them perfect for taking in the car and snaking. The kids loved them too. They were not overly salted, just lightly. The best part, they were crispy, not soft and bland like they have been on a shelf somewhere for ages. Just perfect. Will buy again."
1,"These seeds have the perfect amount of salt and crispiness. Truly taste like pumpkin seeds you'd bake yourself! Huge step up compared to the typical bleached, too salty seeds that others sell. I definitely recommend this brand."
1,"One of the the things I hate about buying snack food is most companies can not get the right amount of salt on to foods.<br /><br />That was not a problem here.<br /><br />Great flavor, nice sized packets."
1,"I love these pumpkin seeds!  The bag is resealable, so I can just take a small handful and keep the rest fresh.  They are really crispy and the taste is amazing too.  Try them!"
0,"I was going to give these seeds a 3-star rating until I realized, they're not good enough to order again. I'm sure I don't want them again so I'm closer to ""I don't like"" than ""OK"".<br /><br />The good:<br />The salt content IS pretty good. On par with how we season our own.<br />They're crisp.<br /><br />The bad:<br />Seeds are pretty small which means the ratio between seed and shell is not great.<br />Small seeds means you almost can't shell them, you HAVE to eat the shells.<br />Too many seeds have a sour taste which ruins the hole experience.<br />Per ounce they're more expensive than any others I've tried.<br /><br />I wish David's Seeds put out a lighter sea salt version. Their seeds are much larger so you can peel the shells if you want. They just have too much salt. I remember eating the Indian brand when I was a kid. They had a great tasting seed but unfortunately even more salt than Davids."
1,"These are fantastic. I bought two cases of them. They are not too salty, just enough to be able to eat as many as you like without getting overly salty.  I will likely buy more when I run out. These crispy seeds are hard to find in grocery stores. I found them someplace like a convenience gas station but cannot remember where that was so I checked here for them."
1,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JFKU9W"">Energy Club Crispy Pumpkin Seeds, 3.50-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>My favorite pumpkin seeds to snack on. Lightly salted and very crunchy with good flavor."
1,"It's difficult finding pumpkin seeds in my area so I turned to Amazon. I usually eat David pumpkin seeds, but when searching for them on Amazon (which the site does carry) I came across these. The reviews seemed decent enough so I decided to give them a try. I'm not disappointed. The seeds are crispy and lightly salted; a perfect snack. If you like taking the seeds out of their shell, then this product isn't for you, but if you like eating them whole...then you should try these."
1,"These are the best if you like the kind of seeds you make yourself during Halloween.  If you like the white ones that you find at the gas station stores you won't like these.  They taste fresh out of the oven, brown and lightly salted.  These are by far the best I've ever had."
1,These seed taste really good.  I wish they were a little bigger- if they were I would have given them a 5 rather than 4.  Enjoy!
1,"I had just gotten home from my weekly bowling league to find my fiancee in bed with our neighbor.  You know how they say that a mother has so much adrenaline pumping through her system when her child is in danger that she can just about lift a car off of it?  When I saw those two desecrating my queen-sized air mattress in the corner, I got so worked up that I could have taken that mother and her child, locked them up in the trunk of that car, and tossed it onto the roof of of the self-storage facility around the corner, the one with the orange hangar-style doors.  That's three stories high.  Anyway, the two fled out the back door and I went into a rage.  I broke everything in the house that reminded me of her.  The toaster-oven she used to make me pepperoni bagel-bites for breakfast each morning, the ironing board that we trimmed the legs down on so that it could double as a coffee table during that Pawn Stars marathon last July.  After about 45 minutes, I was totally drained from breaking stuff.  I took the truck down the road to the Citgo station to refuel and got a sleeve of those mini-powdered donuts and a Redbull Zero because my doctor says that too much sugar will make my Diabetes flare up.  It's a lot less syrupy than the regular Redbulls, but it definitely perked me back up.  On the way home, that Mr. Mister song about Broken Wings came on and I knew it was a sign because my heart was broken and Redbull gives you wings.  At that point, I knew I had to forgive her.  We've been happily married for 8-months now with a little one on the way, and I can honestly say that without Redbull Zero, I may have never gotten up the courage to patch things up.  I highly recommend this product to anyone going through a rough patch in their relationship."
1,"I love dried fruit, and these apricots are some of the best I have ever had. Moist, favorful and of the best quality."
1,I order this pearl sugar to make liege waffle.<br />I looked up other Belgian pearl sugar too but it was way to big granulate.<br />This sugar has just right size and amount for my waffle.<br />I definitely will order again later when I need it.
1,"I can't imagine how you could mess up sugar and this product is exactly what it's supposed to be. I tried the recipe for kanelbullar from the box and it was a little dry and dense. Then again, that was the first thing I've baked in about 20 years so it could have been me!"
0,"Used these in a waffle recipe that said they would dissolve and make air pockets that had some sweetness, resulting in a light, crispy waffle.  They did not dissolve but became burned clusters that got stuck to the waffle iron grids.  The waffles were like lead, were sickening sweet and basically the worst ones I've ever eaten.  I certainly would not recommend this Pearl Sugar to anyone."
1,"Mayonnaise is an interesting product, cool, smooth and creamy it's the lush counter partner of the low cal mustard but it's of those things people think they don't like until they taste it in the proper way and that's all it takes for a secret love affair with luxe sauces  and recipes that can be made with it to start.<br /><br />I am a big fan of sandwiches and any new way I can spruce them up, especially with nice sauces and spices is always at the top of my new ideas to make for lunch or to fill into an interesting menu on the weekends. The Rouille is spicy, that I deducted just from looking at the angry orange color in the jar, the color of auburn harvest on a stormy night. The taste is of cream immersed in a sea of chili peppers and garlic with a peppery background. My favorite way to eat it is in a sandwich with a leftover cold coconut breaded chicken cutlet with some crisp romaine in between two toasted crusty slices of bread smeared on the inner sides with the Rouille spicy mayonnaise . The taste is a tropical rendition of a Caesar Chicken Sandwich I get at Hale and Hearty here in NYC but much easier since I made it at home and it took no effort.<br /><br />Great on bread, meat or as a condiment to any afternoon snack or smeared on some California roll for a spicy finish. There is no end to the amount of uses this product provides.<br /><br />- Kasia S."
1,"Barry Farms is known for their quality and rare, hard-to-find ingredients. Xanthan Gum is no exception, but anything can be found on Amazon, right? Barry Farms to the rescue!<br /><br />Xanthan Gum is used to modify the viscosity of liquids, on a very low scale (typically 1/3 tsp per 1 gallon). Because of the difficulty in combining Xanthan Gum to a liquid evenly, you should mix this into your liquid very slowly, in a blender at full speed, and it should be one of your steps (before adding other ingredients, including Guar Gum).<br /><br />Many ice creams and popsicles, even Italian ices, call for two main ingredients: Xanthan Gum and sometimes Guar Gum (also available from Barry Farms: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00015UC5M?tag=a52-20&ie=UTF8). Both of these gums behave quite differently, and Xanthan Gum can be harder to mix into your liquid solution (again, mix in slowly via blender running on high), but both are effective means to preventing crystallization of liquids, which is the secret to making softer ice cream and popsicles instead of rock hard ice!<br /><br />Another interesting characteristic of Xanthan Gum is its ability to thin out when subjected to forces such as shaking (called shearing), which makes it great for poured sauces, as it will thicken back up after having exited the bottle. It can also prevent oils from separating from liquid-oil emulsions (think salad dressing). It is also more stable under a wider range of temperatures and pH than other gums.<br /><br />Xanthan Gum can also be used to give dough the stickiness that is needed in gluten-free baking, as gluten is usually what gives that sticky characteristic to dough. And no matter the use, Xanthan Gum will always remain colorless and flavorless, so it can be used for just about any need that suits it."
1,"Well, that says it all...add some to anything as a thickener / tiny bit - works wonders.  Fast delivery from family run farm/store (nice folks) - average pricing."
0,"Was very happy to find this at such a resonable price and I am sure it will a very good product.  The unfortunate part is they seem to charge shipping according to the price of an item, not the weight.  By the time you add up shipping and price of the xanthan gum you will pay the same anywhere.  Not a savings!"
1,"I dont know how anyone can complain that this product is pricey.Walk into any healthfood store and be prepared to pay 14$ for the same size of xanthan gum.Also Barry Farms has the best selection of every imaginable food product,gluten-free or not and very good prices.I was very happy when I ordered from them previously.My little bag of xanthan gum has lasted me over a year and I bake alot."
1,"The Xanthan Gum works great as a thickening agent when cooking hot meals or even smoothies in the blender.  It takes the place of corn starch or flour when I am making a stew.  I've tried buying this product at health food stores but could only find it on Amazon.  A tiny bit goes a long way, so even though the bag is small, it will last a long time."
1,"I used this product to make my own lubricant, and it works wonders.  I'm not sure what else it's used for, but it makes great lube!"
1,We have celiac disease and make most of our foods from scratch.  This product can be very difficult to find in the average store.  Super fast shipping.  I never run out!
1,This was shipped to me quickly and in good condition. They were exactly what I wanted/needed for my Gluten Free lifestyle! Thanks!
1,It works great for gluten free flour. I was able to make 100% Spelt bread because of this product. I can't complain.
0,"I bought this online because it was much cheaper than in my local health-food store.  Then I got slapped with a $7 shipping charge!  For a teeny envelope of product!  I'll buy from the store, thanks."
0,"This baby food was really thick and my baby wouldn't eat it.  Every other stage 2 food that I've gotten may have been a bit thicker, but this was really very thick, nearly the consistency of regular mashed potatoes, it also seemed very paste like.  All the other food I've gotten from Sprout has been fantastic!"
1,Will buy again in the future...my baby girl (11 months) loved it! Great thicker food for babies learning to eat chunkier textures.
1,"I don't often give my daughter packaged baby food, just in emergencies.. I let her try this and she loved it.. I'll probably try other sprout varieties as well."
1,"I have never really cared much for salads, but went on a diet that required me to eat a lot of spinach. I mixed the spinach with greens, onions, and yellow peppers and added this vinegar with a little olive oil and it is so good that I feel like I am having a dessert! I have only used it as a salad dressing, but am sure it would be great used in various ways. (I saw someone say it was good to dip strawberries)"
1,"My local newspaper did a gourmet test on balsamic vinegars.  Of all the vinegars they tested, this one came out best. Here was their trick, they simmered the bottle of vinegar in a sauce pan and reduced the liquid in half. The result is a rich syrup with incredible, concentrated flavor."
1,"These are great tasting and while they aren't good for you per se, they are much healthier than most brands. They are fresh tasting and crunchy. My only complaint would be that the chips are small, not too many good sized ones in bag. The smaller 1.5oz bags were better as they stay fresher better. I will buy these again."
1,"I love most of the chips that this company makes. When I say ""most"", the pepper, and the garlic are a bit much for me, but if you like a big jolt of either, these would probably be for you. I'm very health conscious, and these are simply potatoes, avacado, or olive oil, and a few seasonings. So many chip brands have ingred. a mile long, and made with oils that equate to motor oil, in my book ... ugh! The ""Good Health Chips"" are the only ones I'll grab. They cost more that most, but worth the price, in my opinion. The Barbeque, vinegar/salt, and Chilean Lime are my favs."
1,"I bought a pack of this and the Chilean Lime. My wife likes the lime, which are good, but strong tasting. On the other hand, these BBQ chips have a relatively subtle BBQ flavor; nothing like a bag of Lays for instance. The potato taste comes through more than the seasoning. I like them a lot. I'm not sure about the ""health"" value, but I'm a fan!"
1,I have been taking this product for about two months and dropped 14 pounds without a hard diet. I continue to eat all food groups but in moderation.<br />No huge meals but dinot have to avoid carbs either. You may not see a huge weight loss in pounds but pay attentionto the fat decreasearound your waist and neck if you have that problem. I take one oune in the morning and one ounce before or afer dinner.<br />I was bying from GNC but Amazon has a much better prize so from now on I will take advantage of my Amazon Prime. :-)
0,"I ordered 3 bottles to give it an honest try because I didn't think one bottle would give me enough time to honestly review it. One bottle lasts approximately 15 days. I just opened up my 3rd bottle and I still haven't really noticed much of anything. The taste isn't too bad.<br /><br />The following comment is for the person who previously reviewed the product: I believe that what you were looking at was NOT the expiration date but rather the date it was made. I bought this product as well and was worried that I would have the same problem as you described until I realized that it had an expiry date as well as a production date. The production date was dated as ""something/something 2011."" And incidentally, the expiry date on my product was shown to be ""something/something 2013"" so that also prompts me to think that you probably looked at the wrong date and mistook 2011 for the expiry date."
0,"I have been purchasing this product from GNC and love it--my appetite was curbed and I had more energy, but not the bad jittery type of energy.  The product I received from Amazon was rancid and it looks like the seal was glued back on.  I had a co-worker compare the taste of the product I purchased from GNC and the product I received from Amazon, just to be sure, and she agreed that there was definitely something wrong with the juice I received from Amazon.  If you've never tried this juice, I would suggest you first purchase a bottle from GNC so you know how it's supposed to taste."
1,"I was told about this product a couple of months ago, but with so many ""crazy products"" out there, I must confess, I was not a believer, but when I saw the person who told me about it, looking not only ""amazing"", but her skin was glowing, her belly was gone and her hair looking better than ever. I had to order it, I read the reviews, did the basic research and ordered 2 bottles. I was amazed, glad and happy when I received them the very next morning. ""WOW!"", I thought, this is ""great service!"". I have been drinking it for 2 days and it does what it says, it suppresses your appetite, gives you energy and boost the metabolism. The one thing I have noticed, and most likely the reason it has not worked on some people is because this would not suppress your anxiety, and if you are an emotional eater as I am, you are going to have to teach yourself how to eat in smaller portions, eat healthier and control yourself. This really helps and it really works, you will get results if you follow the directions. Hope this help you make the right choice for your health and your future new self."
1,"When it comes to weight loss, there is no such thing as one size fits all.  I don't care what the bottle looks like and I am not going to deduct points because it took an extra day or two to get to me.  What really matters is 1-Does it work? and 2-Are there any side effects?  My co-worker started taking this and based on the reviews, I figured it was another gimic. Then I tried it.  I literally felt the energy burst about 15 minutes after taking it.  As I left the office for the day, it dawned on me that I did not eat my normal morning or afternoon snack because I was not hungry.  At lunch, I only ate half of my sandwich and (believe it or not) even turned down the brownie tray.  This is huge!  I like the taste, I like the ingredients, and even after taking a shot before dinner - fell asleep at my normal time.  I'm sold and will make this a regular part of my plan.  This product does exactly what it says it does - appetite suppressant."
0,I was disappointed with this product. It arrived quickly but does not work for me. Feel it was a waste of money.
1,"I read about this in a magazine. It was recommended for weight loss, and cholestrol control. I don't know if it helped so much with my weight loss, but it did lower my cholstrol by 20 points!My Dr. told me to stay on it. It tastes good, and I got it here much cheaper than my first order elsewhere. It also lists a standerdized extract on the bottle, many of this in pill form do not.<br />I would recommed it to try to anyone."
0,"Anyone else have seasonal allergy type reactions? This stuff, for me, is hayfever allergies in a bottle.<br /><br />I performed a little test and here are all the details:<br /><br />- after taking it Monday twice each day, I thought I suddenly had caught a cold or developed seasonal allergies... I was REALLY bad Tuesday.  I had to resort to aspirin and Benadryl to get through the day. It was truly awful and I wanted to go home early for feeling so sick. Headache, itchy eyes, watery mouth, constantly stuffed and runny nose, tired...<br /><br />- After staying up quite late and finally falling asleep with the window open and the fan on, blowing in whatever pollen or cold air was outside, I woke up today (Wed) feeling totally fine. This is when I knew something was up. No cold or seasonal allergies disappears overnight with the window open and a fan on you.<br /><br />- So, I did an experiment today. I waited until halfway through the day (2pm) to take the first dose of African Bush Mango juice... the recommended dosage of 2 tbsp. A half hour after drinking this stuff, a mild headache came on, then within the next hour my eyes began itching and my throat felt scratchy and my mouth started feeling watery and, finally, I started sneezing and blowing my nose again.<br /><br />No doubt about it, this produces a seasonal allergy type reaction for me. Only other time ingesting anything ever did something like this was when I thought I would just go ahead and throw the beet stems in my juicer to be ""extra healthy."" I am not allergic to beets, but beet stems made my eyes run green snot. This stuff produces almost as bad a reaction. So... throwing away the full $18 bottle when I get home."
1,"I started on this juice about 6 weeks ago with reservation. Did not think it would work, but have noticed a vast difference in fat loss. I take it with every meal consisting of balanced proteins, carbs and fats. Sometimes if I go overboard and overeat I definitely make sure I use it before I engage in a heavy meal.I now have a lot of loose body fat particularly around my waist and upper back area. I look forward to going to the gym to do my cardio and toning excercises to tighten up the loose skin. This juice has definitely made a difference in losing my ab fat. This was my most difficult area to lose. I am a size 10 at the top but wear a size 4 in skirts and pants. Obviously my most stubborn and difficult areas are my abs, back and upper body.I like the taste of this particular brand. I did try another brand but did not like the flavor as much as I like this one. That's the only reason I am able to continue using because the flavor is great. I will continue to use this brand until I reach my goal of fat loss. I've tried alot of products but this seems to be working the best for right now."
0,IT helped me lose weight but it was expired it was 2010 and i purchased it not to long ago i could have gotten really sick!!!!
0,I have been taking this for six weeks.  I have not lost any weight.  If I were you I would save my money.
1,"I love the Flake Dipped (I used to live in England).  This is the best price I've found, and they arrived quickly.  I'll reorder soon!"
0,"well, they are stated on line as chips then when order they are stixs, and I received expired food product expiration date Dec. 2012....great wonder what they would tasted like fresh.  Will not be ordering from Good Health agin."
1,"I boil the water, add cereal and simmer for 1 min then remove from heat and add frozen blueberries, rasberries and walnuts, cover and let sit until fruit is warm. Very good cereal and sticks with me till lunch."
1,"If Amazon would get on the ball and offer this cereal with free shipping, I'd order it regularly!  It's the best gluten free hot cereal!  Reminds me of eating cream of wheat and malt-o-meal!  But if I have to pay for shipping, I'm better off buying it at the store.  Come on Amazon!!"
1,"This is an excellent gluten free alternative to oatmeal.  The taste is really not like any other hot cereal, the buckwheat isn't dominant but compliments the corn.  Sort of like a variant of grits, but I like it with maple syrup, cinnamon and apple chunks."
1,My family simply loves this ceral! We will always purchase it through Amazon. Bob makes great products! My child will only eat this most mornings.
1,"I don't have to eat a gluten free diet but I still like this!  It's a great way to consume a variety of whole grains. You can dress it up many different ways and it doesn't get old. We like it with a little peanut butter, agave nectar, and cinnamon! Yum! I'll try it soon with banana also  :  I don't usually pay good attention to the time but I'm pretty sure I usually undercook it some."
1,"I love this stuff.  I would eat it even if I was not gluten free.  It is high in fiber, and low in calories, and tastes really good.  Something that is truly hard to find for those of us that don't consume gluten."
1,"I first had this tea at a convention several years ago and took a few samples, Then my mother-in-law ordered it for me for Christmas. And now I am ordering for myself. Its really smooth and light tasting and fruity and much better then the Herbal Lipton that I purchased by mistake. This one is really good and I make it each night before bed. You can also put a little Splenda or Honey in it as well. I tend to drink it plain, but sometimes I add the Honey or the Splenda. Enjoy !!!"
1,"Even though I know its supposed to be good for me, I am not a huge fan of most herb teas.  Mighty Leaf - African Nectar is THE exception.  I was first served this tea at my hair spa.  What caught my attention was the smell; flowery, sweet, a touch of herbs, then the taste, not bitter, not sweet, but refreshing.  In addition the smell doesn't fade, and the tea doesn't grow bitter if left with the tea bag in for a longer period than recommended!<br />This tea is fairly expensive as herb teas go, but it IS worth it.  I have plenty of half used packets in my pantry of other failed tea experiments.  This time I have one which is a keeper.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ET5XZS"">Mighty Leaf Herb Tea, African Nectar, 15-Count Whole Leaf Pouches, 1.32 Ozs. (Pack of 3)</a>"
1,This tea makes my top three list for flavor and tea I like to drink.  It is a full-bodied tropical fruit flavor that smells great even before you brew it.  A wonderful blend of roobios tea that I highly recommend.
1,"I had to give up coffee and I do not enjoy tea.  However, I had this African Nectar tea at a restaurant and fell in love with it.  I found it on Amazon so ordered 2 boxes of it.  I have been sharing it with my friends who rave about it and my husband is drinking it also.  It has a wonderful bouquet and a slighty fruity flavor."
1,"We were turned on to African Nectar by our son, who gave us a couple of bags. Now we drink it everyday. Although the Mighty Leaf brand can be a pricey, we find that we can make two or more pots of tea from a single bag. Most herbal teas only make one cup per bag before running out of flavor. African Rooibos leaves, combined with other herbs, makes a herbal tea that's very flavorful. It's hard to compare it with other herbal flavors."
1,"I agree with all the other positive reviews here.  I too discovered this blend from a single pouch offered as part of a selection at a restaurant.  It has the flavor of black tea without the acidity.  The notes of fruit offer just a hint of sweetness, and does not dominant the flavor, which I like (I'm not a fan of fruity herbal teas). After brewing, I mix this dark, rich tea with warm milk to make a tea latte for morning tea.  I don't think I could make this a blend I drink every day but I do enjoy having it around for variety."
1,This tea is really wonderful but vary expensive in the stores.  It is still expensive buying from Amazon but less so than in the stores.  I will continue to purchase the African Nectar tea from Amazon--a less expensive addiction than wine.  Finding good herbal teas is a hobby of mine.  This one qualifies as one of the best.
1,"This is my first herbal tea that I have tried. Let me tell you that the taste is just perfect. The pouch for the tea bag is something I have never seen before. It is some type of cloth material which when steeped, releases all the flavors and is very good for the environment.<br /><br />I drink this tea usually after dinner because it just relaxes my mind and body. The tea doesn't need any sugar to be added because of the sweet orangy taste. I would highly recommend this tea to beginner tea drinkers and also because of the many health benefits."
1,Very flavorful herbal tea. Just a hint of sweetness. It is my daily morning beverage. What more can I say?
1,I buy my Mighty Leaf Teas from Amazon - can't go wrong!  The Organic African Nectar is a much more robust tea.  It is especially good with Leighton's Orange Blossom Honey.  I like this tea in the morning and throughout the day.  It is very satisfying.
1,"I am a fan of mighty leaf teas and it is a good deal over here to buy three boxes,<br />I am happy with the purchase"
1,"This tea is awesome.  Love it's smoothness... Reminds me of the smoothness of Asaam.  It's very light in taste and comforting without hints of bitterness.  I love it plain but when the mood strikes, I've added drops of honey, grated ginger or even lemon juice and peels.  My bro happened to have it at a fine restaurant several years ago and recommended I try it - been hooked ever since.  When friends come over and choose a non-caffeinated tea, they usually choose this one; even the ones who don't usually do teas.  So imagine my grin at finding this three-pack on Amazon.<br /><br />True story:  Gave this to a good friend a couple years ago whose mom is a tea connoisseur, highly selective of her loose-leaf brews and doesn't do tea bags.  I've heard it sung she rather enjoyed this Mighty Leaf... and ended up taking my friend's whole stash."
1,"I am a black tea (with caffeine) fan. Still I like the aroma of this tea. Not a bad flavor either. Goes well with honey (even fresh ginger, if you like ginger) But, as some other reviewer said, it is better to try it (I did) before you order 45 tea bags."
1,"I've had to cut back on caffeine, so I've been trying out various herbal teas. This so far is my favorite. It has a slightly fruity, vanilla and mild tobacco scent and flavor to it. Coffee was giving me heartburn, but this tea is nice and mild, and since it's decaf it can be enjoyed throughout the day. I drink it plain since it has natural sweetness - it is a wonderful calorie-free treat!"
1,"This is one of my favorite teas. Had it at a restaurant, bought some online, and I'm NOT dissappointed! You'll love it."
1,"I drink a variety of black, green, and herbal teas. This is my favorite flavor.  First got introduced to this tea when I had a bad sinus infection.  I drove by a little place called ""Joe Beans"" in Virginia and asked them to recommend a hot tea to soothe my sinuses, and this is what they recommended.  It's awesome with honey! I haven't tasted another tea yet that beats this flavor."
1,"This is an absolutely great tasting tea. It has lots of flavor and just smells good even before you taste it. You can enjoy it with out sugar or sweetners (neither is good for you). It has a calming effect and does not contain caffine. A friend in Washington, D.C. turned me onto it, I went shoping for it as soon as I got home to the Bay Area. I continue to not only buy more but also to throughly enjoy it and turning others onto African Nectar from Mighty Leaf."
1,"I love this tea - it's organic, it goes nicely with either milk (I use almond milk) or with lemon / honey. It has a very pleasant sweet fruity/floral flavor."
1,"Although I'm not generally a tea drinker, I was introduced to this tea by a friend. Immediately I loved it. It has a fresh and fruity flavor that I find both refreshing and soothing at the same time. I drink it in the evenings because it contains no caffeine and it helps me to unwind after a long day. I highly recommend it for both it's taste and quality."
1,"Enticingly fragrant and delicious, you will undoubtedly enjoy this pick -- the silk bags are biodegradable, and the leaf strength is often enough for me to reuse the bags three times and still enjoy the flavor!"
1,This tea is unreal. It smells just as great as it tastes. I never need to add sweetener or sugar because it is perfectly sweetened and delicious. It is always a must have in my household!!!
1,"My family has been drinking this tea for a while, but I never really knew what it was all about. When I was offered a cup of this, I instantly fell in love with the rich flavor and aroma. The African Nectar is a great variety as well as the Green Tea Tropical. You will love this no matter how much you know about tea. Great, great product."
1,I've been buying this tea for about 6 years now and it is my all time favorite.  The silk like pouch the tea comes in allows the flavors of the tea to come through without the papery taste you get from other tea bags.  This tea is worth the extra expense.
1,"I was recently introduced to Green Mountain's Country Blend.  A friend sent me several flavored K-cups to try, and one of these was in the package. This coffee is hard to explain exactly. All I can say is they hit it on the head with it's name. It reminds me of a diner I ate breakfast at last time I was up in Vermont. The only way I can impart how this tastes and smells to you is to say that it's like Coffee Peoples Donut Shop coffee (my standard), but made with the mineral-rich water of Vermont, so it's VERY full-bodied. Like brewing it with Dasani bottled water, if that makes any sense to you. It's a VERY pleasing cup of coffee, but maybe not for everyone as it's a touch saltier (but not salty).<br /><br />If you don't like it, I'm sure you'll find someone on the K-Cup Exchange at Yahoo Groups who will trade it for something you do like, or will buy it from you at a fair price. It's an AWESOME K-Cup web site<br />H T T P  [...]"
1,I brewed this in my B40 @ the 7.25 cup size. I drink my coffee with a liquid creamer and a sugar substitute; just so you will know where I'm coming from.<br /><br />I received this Kcup in a trade in our Yahoo group who had put together a nice variety pack. I keep a journal of all the Kcups I have tried and I found this to be very pleasant cup of coffee with low acidity little after taste and no bitterness. If I didn't have so many kcups right now I would purchase this wonderful blend.
1,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:31 Mins<br /><br /></span>Listed as one of Green Mountain Coffee's ""most popular blends,"" the Vermont Country Blend offers a safe choice if your Keurig serves a larger audience, such as an office environment.<br /><br />The coffee has a pleasing aroma, with hints of fruit and caramel, and a gentle finish. While Green Mountain's website describes this as ""an engaging blend that reveals itself in layers"" but that was not my experience. It is a pleasant, middle-of-the-road blend, but not the type of K-cup I'll reach for first in the morning.<br /><br />One reason the Vermont Country Blend didn't blow my socks off was that it arrived at the same time we ordered Green Mountain Coffee's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004743O08"">Nantucket Blend</a>.

0,"Got 6 of this variety in a K-Cup Sampler and didn't like it.  I made 2 cups on the strongest setting (6oz.) and it tasted incredibly weak and watered down.  What flavor it did have was kinda strange.  It was sort of woody and mushroomy.  Love my k-cups, just not this one.  So far, the Timothy's Columbian has been my fav.  The Green Mountain Donut house is good as well."
1,This is an excellent coffee - not too strong and not too weak. Perfect blend and is great any time of day. No weird flavor or aftertaste.
1,"If you like the classic taste of a good margarita, it's likely you'll find Baja Bob's Margarita Mix to be an acquired taste at best and a cruel joke at worst.  Not that it tastes horrible, but like most contests between similar products that are sugar-based and sugar-free, the recipe for which you already have a preference is going to win despite the competition's particular and sometimes overwhelming merits.  Since I've decided to limit my sugar intake but not my affection for margaritas, this tequila mixer is best suited to take care of the problem, so I've decided to stick with it and learn to like it.  Over time I've at least grown accustomed to the taste (adding extra Triple Sec helps), even if I can't say it's the best improvement to margaritas since the salt rimmed glass.  Splenda certainly works better in some things than others.  In this case it's a qualified success with taste taking a subjective second place to functionality.  I don't love it or hate it, but I don't miss the sugar either.  To that end Baja Bob's Margarita Mix does what it's supposed to do very well."
1,"As a type 2 diabetic I've always resigned myself to drinking just straight scotch or bourbon when imbibing on occasion as mixed drinks are loaded with carbs and the few sugar free ones either weren't so much carb free (""sugar alcohol"" from maltatol or the like) or they tasted just awful. I tried the original Margarita mix from Baja Bob and was very pleasantly surprised by how great it was. I then went a little nuts and ordered 1 of just about every flavor offered off their site (not all flavors are available on Amazon but they are a few bucks cheaper here than off Baja's site directly when you order in sets of 3). Here's the short rundown on my take:<br /><br />The lime margarita mixes (both the original and the Key Lime) are fantastic - both blended with ice and on the rocks they hold their own with any Margarita mix I've tried. I prefer the original since it's a little more ""tart"" the way I think a lime margarita should be in my book. For folks here that complain about it being too limey they may want to try the key lime - it's a little milder.<br /><br />The strawberry margarita mix was ok - a bit sweet for my taste but to be fair I'm not really that big of a strawberry margarita guy to begin with.<br /><br />The Pina Colata mix was very good and even my wife liked that one as well and she _never_ partakes in cocktails with me. Note that there are around 4 carbs per serving with this instead of the usual zero for the rest of their mixers. The coconut cream in the mix has a few carbs - but totally worth it. Creamy and smooth blended with ice in a good blender. Very nice.<br /><br />The mojito mix is decent. I can make a pretty passable sugar free mojito myself but this is pretty good. I probably wont bother to stock up on it because it's not a must have mixer for me.<br /><br />All the martini mixes were just awful in my book. Other folks seem to like them, maybe it's just not my thing.  The apple and cranberry tasted like medicine to me and I promptly tossed the rest of the bottles after the first taste. The lemon was pretty poor and I gave it a couple shots before throwing the rest out.<br /><br />I didn't care for the hurricane mix and tossed the rest - but again, to be fair I'm not really a hurricane fan to begin with so I'm not necessarily a good judge on this one.<br /><br />The sweet and sour mix made a nice whiskey sour. Not the best I've had by any stretch but perfectly servicible in my book.<br /><br />Finally the Mai Tai was pretty good - Not my favorite drink in the world but this was as good as any I'd had.<br /><br />So they're batting around .500 give or take. Definitely worth picking up a few bottles and testing out - I think some folks that are skeptical, particularly about the margaritas and pina colatas will be pleasantly surprised."
0,"You have to cut this down with Sprite Zero or water (Sprite Zero preferably), because it's SO strong - super limey and acidic.  Better than the Finest Call Carb conscious (which has sugar alcohol in it and makes you feel kinda sick), but not better tasting."
0,"In principle a Splenda Margarita mix sounded like a great idea. The execution was terrible. I poured both of my two bottles down the drain. You would have to be pretty desparate, or otherwise never have had a decent margarita if this was your choice. I would rather skip altogether, as one of the other reviewers had suggested as well. The market has a long way to go to support less sugar in drinks."
0,"I would be the first to applaud these products if they were good.  Unfortunately, I would rather give up drinking that have to drink this tasteless slop.  There is a very nasty, artificial acrid, too citrusy, while at the same time too sweet, taste to these products. The strawberry margherita mix has a very faint taste of strawberry, but no amount of doctoring could make it drinkable.  I poured the mix out.  The Mai Tai mix -- poured it out.  I bought several bottle/dry drink mixes of all their varieties without trying them first.  BIG MISTAKE!  I am either going to pour them out or throw them out, since the folks at Baja Bob's web site have refused to even respond to my request that I return the unopened products for a refund.  You will also note that on their web site's ""fan club"" page, there are 0 entries.  Save your money unless you are totally desperate.  You'd be better off using Crystal Light Ruby Red Grapefruit.  Now, that tastes pretty good mixed with Vodka."
1,"I think Baja Bob's is terrific!  I took another reviewer's advice and added a little Triple Sec to the Tequila and mix and it was fabulous.  Surely, anyone who is ordering this has tasted diet drinks before.  If you are used to drinking only drinks with real sugar, you might not like it.  It is perfect for anyone who is trying to cut back on their carbs and still wants a Margarita.  THANK YOU BOB!!"
1,"I gave the Pina Colada mix one star because it was pretty bad, but the citrus ones I find to be quite drinkable."
1,I'm not sure what the people expect who do not like this product.  I use this as well as the OTB 0 calorie mix you can buy at grocery store and I think they are both great.  I love the margarita but had all the calories.  Give it a try and you will not be sorry!
1,"Although not stated in the ingredients, it has a subtle yet definitive taste of cumin. I assume it is in the mix they call spices. I think it's brilliant. A full flavor sauce that goes with everything. Has a fair amount of heat."
1,"I've been drinking Yellow Label Tea since the 80's. This is an excellent and versitile tea, makes for a good hot tea and also a refreshing iced tea. A bit stronger than regular ""brisk lipton"" tea typically found in the U.S. I used to have to wait until I traveled to the British Virgin Islands or the Bahamas to find this tea, but now it's on Amazon (darn, my excuses to travel are dwindling!). This is an Orange Pekoe tea in 200g bags. You can find different varieties of tea marked with the ""Lipton Yellow Label"" brand, usually loose leaf teas. For instance I have a Sri Lanka-packed metal tin of ""Pure Ceylon,"" a box of ""Coarse Black Tea"" packed in Mumbai, and another ""new bright & rich"" Mumbai variety which is a blend of ""Assam teas."" These other varieties can be found in middle eastern, Indian, and Asian markets here in the US. All good teas, but this Orange Pekoe in the bags is the most convenient and has the smoothest flavour."
1,"Traveling world wide, I've come to much prefer good tea to bad coffee, and good teas are so much more common.<br /><br />Yellow Label is one of the most popular teas in the world because it has a rich, clean flavor without bitterness.  Its clear distinctive red color makes it also one of the prettiest.  The only supermarket teas I've found in the US that taste similar are the ""English Breakfast"" labels.  If you like these, or like strong black tea flavor without the bitterness or muddiness of overbrewing the usual black teas, you should try Yellow Label."
1,"I first enjoyed Yellow Label in the Caribbean 20 yrs ago and have since in travels worldwide been looked at oddly at groceries as I purchased 20 boxes to take home. There it was only tea, in the US it wasn't available...or oddly in London which appears on the label.  A letter to Lipton 6 years ago gave no explanation for not marketing in the US, just ""coupons to try our other brands"".  Finally, Amazon has it and even better a market in Chinatown here in NYC.<br />What makes it great?  It's the only black tea that is full flavored but not bitter.  It's so smooth that you literally can make a pot of it, leave the bags in, reheat it the next day and still have no bitterness.  This is a tea lover's tea that I have turned numerous travel companions onto for life and something I would be lost without."
1,"I was first given a box of this Yellow Label from a co-worker who had traveled to China.  I instantly fell in love with the smooth flavor.  I found it in a Food Max in Stockton, Ca but then the store closed down.  I have been on a search for the last two months because my loose leaf is almost gone also.  I was brewing the tea for the staff in my office and they all love it, so when I ran out of tea bags they all wanted to know where I got the tea from.  The flavor is so smooth that you almost do not need any type of sweetner at all.  This should be made available in the states in at least one major grocery store.  I am buying enough to share with my friends....."
1,". . . you'll love this one. I fell in love with this black tea blend when I lived in Europe, and was disappointed when I returned to America that I couldn't buy it here. One taste of this smooth tea and you might change from coffee. It's the best cup of tea you'll ever drink."
1,It has a distinct taste that differs from the regular Lipton. I wish it were more readily available in the stores in US.
1,"I drink lots of hot tea. Don't confuse this with the Lipton Tea you find at the grocery. There is no comparison. This is the good stuff. I bought this at a local farmers market(Atlanta) and since they closed, no one else carries it, so I ordered it from Amazon. Specify ""Yellow Label Tea""."
0,"This is a repeat of the same review I left for another Amazon listing for the same tea (but at a significantly different price).  Despite the price difference, both listings appear to be for the same item and are sold by the same Indian Grocery.  From reading the other reviews, it is clear that at least one other customer had the same bad experience as I did.<br /><br />I was initially excited to find Lipton Yellow Label Tea on Amazon, as I just got back from Italy and fell in love with it there.  The Lipton Yellow Label Tea in Italy doesn't taste anything like the weak, poor-quality Lipton we get in the U.S., but the tea I ordered on Amazon (sold by Simply Beautiful) is actually manufactured for India and tastes bitter and/or stale.  You can't see from the photo, but the writing on the packages I received is not in English and says it was manufactured in Canada for India.  It is hard to tell whether the variety sold in India just tastes different than the kind in Italy, or if the tea was in fact stale, because there is NO sell-by or expiration date on the package (very disturbing), and the bags are NOT ""foil-wrapped for freshness"" as described on Amazon.  I was extremely disappointed in the taste of this tea from India, having looked forward to the lovely, full-bodied Lipton Yellow Label tea bags that I brought home from Italy.  Not to mention the fact that I would never want to buy imported groceries that don't have an expiration date, so there is no way to know how long they've been sitting in the warehouse, if they are stale, or when they will go stale after opening (especially since they are not individually wrapped).  I returned both boxes of tea and hope to get an Amazon refund soon.  I am very bummed."
1,"The Lipton Yellow Label tea is a step above the ""regular"" Lipton sold here in the States. This is your basic, everyday black tea but it is much more flavorful and bolder than the Lipton variety sold in supermarkets here. It brews a good, bracing cup of tea. I recommend it over the supermarket variety any day. I have used this to make iced tea as well and while it's good over ice, it is best served hot."
1,"I recv'd this tea in great condition. The packing and timeliness were great. I love this tea. It takes me back to when I had our son in an Italian hospital near Pisa, Italy. They brought me Lipton Yellow Label Tea. That was many years ago and I never forgot how good it tasted or stopped looking to buy more once we left Europe. Hubby and I were talking about it and I thought of Amazon! It was right here. I'm enjoying it in the afternoon for a pick me up! Good stuff!"
1,"I must echo the praise of Lipton Yellow Label tea.<br /><br />I don't know how this label may differ across countries, but recently I spent several month-long trips to Pakistan, where Lipton Yellow Label is pretty much all the black tea they serve, and tea is served all the time.  After getting around the initial shock of their custom of putting up to four teabags into 16 ounces of water there, I came to like the Yellow Label tea.  Then when switching a few times to Twinings tea at the hotel business center, I realized that Yellow Label is much better than all the tea I'd been drinking heretofore.  Comparing Yellow Label to other Litpons, other tea available in America, and even Twinings, which I considered the top of the heap, Yellow Label was clearly better.  A Pakistani friend who travels to the U.S. says that American tea is ""insipid"" and refuses to drink it.  I now agree, and think that Lipton Yellow Tea is the best tea I have ever had.  Now I've got to figure out where to buy it.  As far as I'm concerned, Yellow Label is the tea most worth drinking, which no doubt accounts for its popularity in Pakistan."
1,"I discovered yellow tea while on vacation in Thialand. I drink it daily now instead of coffee.  In the summer, it makes a great sun tea."
1,"This is a brand of orange pekoe black tea that is drunk all over the world. Lipton sells it in many countries, and while the product might have the same smooth, almost inoffensive base note, to me the UK version tastes very different than the Indian version, which is perceptable stronger and has a more ""citrusy"" note. While it doesn't hold up to some premium orange pekoe teas, it is distinctly better than the Lipton tea available in US supermarkets."
1,"My wife loves this tea, so I was pleased to be able to order it for her so easily in North America. It arrived promptly, and in good condition."
0,"The company did do a refund for the tea. It looks the same as the box that comes from London. However, it is produced in India and has a very strong, almost bitter taste."
1,I first had this tea in Egypt.  It is so superior to the Lipton sold in the states that I was grateful to find a source online.
1,"Discovered Yellow Label while on a trip to Japan.  I had arrived in Nagoya for a meeting, and had time to  wonder around a market...really just rubber-necking.<br /><br />I bought the familiar Lipton label as well as several other teas.  Yellow Label has a little more pronounced flavor than the US marketed Brisk Lipton tea.  If you are a tea drinker, you will probably enjoy the flavor. The worst part of brewing and drinking Yellow Label...trying to get rid of the box of US standard Lipton Brisk tea I already have sitting in the pantry."
1,"I've been buying primarily whole leaf, oolong, pu'er, jasmine teas from a wholesale tea market in Beijing (Malian St). Though the price is far cheaper than the Ten  Fu (Ten Ren) teas and other retailers, the discernment in quality seemed questionable. I am a simpleton concerning tea. So rather than purchase $90/kg for the base Assam tea, I went to Carre4 and bought an under $5/box of Lipton Yellow label Black tea 100 bags for the consistant quality."
1,"After running out of my usual every-day tea, Trader Joe's brand of ""Irish Breakfast Tea,"" I found this Yellow Label first at my local Chinese supermarket in the tea aisle. I had only had the ""brisk"" version before and wasn't such a Lipton fan, but I needed tea and bought it.<br /><br />Contrary to the rather dusty, mild (watery??) taste of the ""brisk"" American version, Yellow Label has a good flavor and no bitterness, even when brewing for 6 min (I brew a small pot with three bags in the morning). Not quite as rich as Assam tea when mixed with milk and sugar, but a good substitute. And you can't beat the price. A very nice, full every-day tea."
1,"This is the perfect maple sugar candy...melts in your mouth. The price was also extremely fair. I would buy this again, and recommend it to my friends."
1,"I found Lysanders product while waiting for steaks to be cut on South Padre Island.  Really a great product line, not just the chicken rub.  Check out the other seasonings as well."
1,"I have been using this rub for a few years now it is wonderful on chicken (not to mention no msg and all natural).<br />I usually just cut up a whole organic bird and sprinkle it on evenly bake for 30 minutes and it comes<br />out delicious every time (I do spray it with oil during the bake to keep it moist and crisp).<br />All of my kids love it they ask for the ""good chicken""<br />all the time.  It is how I got them off only fried. My local store didn't have it in stock<br />so I came here. have to have it."
1,"We like the pop-top lid on the canned foods eliminating the can opener wrestling match and test of dexterity. Opening the can of Artemis, one sees a solid dog food, light in color with bits of foods like carrots, peas, and potatoes readily visible.<br /><br />Our three pooches like Artemis and  their parents do also. The ingredient list is commendable with no fillers and none of those horrendous animal scraps found in cheaper dog foods. Mostly I like seeing the inclusion of potatoes in the mix. We like the density of the canned food; those runny canned products with high liquid content tend to dirty and stain the canine whiskers and beard. One user of Artemis commented that her dog had much less gas and fewer stools. I'll have to monitor our girls more closely to see if this is the case with them. I do notice a welcome firmness in Evie's stools though. If you're looking to try a premium pet food, give Artemis a try.<br /><br />More reasons to try Artemis -<br /><br />Natural DHA<br />Superior grade protein (human grade)<br />Multi protein source<br />Select vegetables and fruits<br />Custom vitamin and mineral package<br />Balanced level of omega 3 & 6<br />Probiotic/prebiotic<br />Skin and coat conditioners<br />Natural - contains no added chemicals, preservatives, artificial additives, or by-products.<br />No wheat or corn<br />Guarantee- Artemis guarantees your pet will thrive and be satisfied or 100% money back."
1,"Usually when you buy a duo of oils, one is usually way better than the other but both are pretty good.  I've had slightly better black truffle oil at this price but I thought the white was very good."
1,"I'm a lifetime fan of Lipton tea so, there was no risk in this purchase for me.  A 20 count box of Lipton green tea bags is $2.99 at the local Kmart which makes the 240 bags in this box, a $36 retail value, a steal at $20.  The only negative in this review is that once brewed, the tea looks nothing like a green tea.  Instead, it has a nice golden brown appearance like the normal Lipton product.  I bought a bottle of Lipton diet green tea as a comparison and found the 1.5 liter bottle to be good, but too sweet for my taste.  Instead, 6 tea bags and four packets of splenda make the same amount of tea, but much more palatable.  At six bags per bottle, I can make forty bottles of a tea that was about $2 retail for just $20.  If you're intent on having a tea that is a pale light green then this product is not for you.  However, it's a good value, if not exactly the product being advertised."
1,"I have used this product for a long time as Lipton has always been a trusted brand.  I do go through A LOT of tea, so buying it on Amazon was quick, and more affordable then other stores."
1,"My husband drinks a lot of green tea, and this is one of our preferred brands.  I also appreciate that the tea is naturally decaffeinated.  He drinks probably up to half a gallon of tea a day, and I appreciate that he doesn't have a large caffeine intake."
1,"I am so happy I switched from coffee to Lipton Decaff Green Tea.<br />Coffee had been giving me an acid build up which is secreted through my skin, causing burning rashes.<br />Not that I don't love coffee, but the Lipton Decaff Green, of which I drink sometimes 2 pots a day,<br />causes no acid build up. So join the happy tea drinkers. GO GREEN!!!!<br />AMAZON HAS THE LOWEST PRICE ON THIS ITEM......BELIEVE IT!!!!"
1,"Packed well with other purchases. Free shipping, too. Great quality product. Fresh, tasty, healthy. Hot or iced. Will purchase again!"
1,"I like green tea, especially when I'm sick, and this did the trick. I think Lipton is the best Green Tea. Fast delivery, as promised."
1,"Let it be said that I am one who absolutely LOVES my coffee, perhaps a little too much, because for awhile I was drinking about a whole pot (!) a day by myself.<br /><br />It was when I got a stomach ulcer though that I was forced by my doctor to severely cut down on my intake of coffee permanently.  I still enjoy 2-3 small cups a day but no more.<br /><br />Thank heavens Lipton Decaffeinated Green Tea was there to come to the rescue in my case for the desire to drink more beyond that.  I am a huge music fan and am usually listening to my vast CD collection when not at work and seem to always want a hot, soothing beverage to sip to pass the hours by as I listen.  Lipton Green Tea is great for that.  It's extremely easy to make, good for you, naturally decaffeinated and has that clean, pure taste that all Lipton tea has come to be known for.  I think I'm hooked for life on buying the 40-packet boxes at my local store and highly recommend it to those like me wishing to cut down on or even completely eliminate their daily dose of traditional caffeinated coffee."
1,"Getting this product through Amazon has been a pleasure.  The pricing is better than typical retail and it's delivered to my front door free of charge.  I selected to get it sent to me once a month and I can still monitor it and make any changes if necessary.  Again, highly recommended."
1,"No problems. Delivered promptly. . .<br /><br />But I wish i could have the equivalent in bulk, to save money, as I am an avid user of decaffeinated green tea and this habit runs into money."
1,"I use this tea quite a bit.  It's good hot and cold, makes great iced green tea, and you don't have to worry about the caffeine."
1,"I have tried other green teas, but always come back to Lipton as it has the taste I most prefer."
1,"I have become a Decaf Green Tea addict.  Green tea is so good for you and since I cannot stand caffinated drinks this decaf green tea is perfect.  I have to go easy on coffee as it contains too much caffine even in the decaf kind.  This green tea has really helped with my blood pressure and I found out the caffine can cause it to rise.  As long as I stay off too much salt in the diet and decaf, low fat I have been able to stay off medication for high blood pressure.  I can keep that steady with the decaf green tea, this was a bargain for a case lot.  Having the shipping free and delivery in two days it is a saving all around."
1,"Lipton Decaffeinated Green Tea is the perfect thing to drink when you want a soothing hot or cold iced beverage. It works wonders to combat laryngitis as well. The tea bags contain decaffeinated tea which means you'll never lose a night's sleep from drinking this! SMILE<br /><br />Moreover, there are no additives nor are there preservatives. You can use these tea bags a very long time after you bought them in a store or here at Amazon.com online. Amazon states that this tea has antioxidants and in fact it does--but the antioxidants are in the form of flavonoids which are all natural antioxidants. Some evidence suggests that flavonoids reduce the risk for coronary heart disease at the same time that they lower your risk of several types of cancers. Tea flavonoids can also improve your body's immune system.<br /><br />I normally find this green tea most useful for those nasty winter months when I inevitably catch a miserable cold. I heat the water until it's almost at a boiling point; then I put the water and the tea bag into my cup. I let it steep for a few minutes before I add milk and one packet of ""sweet and low."" It's absolutely delicious!<br /><br />Overall, this is a fine quality green tea that will not over stimulate you with caffeine. It is an aromatic hot beverage for when you have a cold and it also makes a delicious iced tea drink on a baking--hot summer's day. Pick some up and try it--you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />SMILE"
1,I really like this green tea. I find it to be much better than the other brand. I add a little lemon and splenda to mine and enjoy it hot or cold.<br /><br />What I wonder is if it is 6/40 count boxes like the title reads or 6/20 count boxes which is in the description??? Hmmm.....If it is 40 counters then this is a great deal.

1,"I work with fondant a lot and I use to buy just white then color it, but that takes a lot of time, is messy, and the colors always turn out different. I discovered Fondarific and I love it!! They have tons of different colors and different flavors. The taste of this is good, the only problem I have is the color is a little darker than I would have liked and when I mix it with white for a lighter purple color it looks more pinkish purple than true purple."
1,"Initially I did not like the color, but once I kneaded it, it was fine.  Good flavor.  Item was shipped as expected."
1,Easy yummy fondant. great for beginners! i love this fondant! wonderful color.. always makes great cakes!  I have used on several cakes. Even the Justin Beiber Cake!
1,"I absolutely love fodarific. This is the third one I've bought and I will continue to buy. It taste really good, and is so easy to work with! Definitely worth the money. Thanks!!"
0,This product made my poor dog sick! I never seen her so sick before. I DO NOT recommend this product at all!
1,I get the raw seeds to use in homemade granola -- so the seeds don't over-toast -- and I found this brand of excellent quality -- a good value too.
0,"I had no idea that totally ""organic"" could mean totally ""tasteless."" The best thing that these can be used for is in cooking oriental dishes or making salads."
1,thought i would try these new hansen beverages in island blast smoothie;worth the trial! So yummy I have everyone at work wanting some
1,Rich garlic flavor.  This is why I ordered it and I am not disappointed!  Generous amount provides enough to last awhile.
1,This is the best mochi i have had so far! It was very fresh and tasted amazing and it shipped super fast!
0,"I just received my shipment of this mochi yesterday and it tasted weird, not good at all. For clarification, I got the red bean and it comes with six in the package (I couldn't find anywhere how many were inside). I ate the first one, didn't like it, tried another and then threw the rest away. I'll stick to my Kohaku kind, just figured I would try out another brand now I know better."
0,"I was disappointed because it was not like mochi that I have had (and enjoyed) in the past.  The rice cake and bean paste were of about the same consistency, and about equally sweet.  And it didn't have the nice flavor of either the rice cake or the bean paste."
0,"Even my 8 year old, who was super excited to eat bugs agrees.  These taste terrible, just disgusting.  Not even worth it for a kid who's happy to be eating bugs."
1,"My son really loves these. He has been watching a lot of those survival tv shows where the need to eat bugs.  While they are way too expensive for what you get, it is quite a novelty gift."
1,"Crystal Light Peach tea give me the type of drink I like and also the amount of water that I have to drink.  I do NOT like to drink water, so the crystal lite is the way to go..."
1,"My dog has always loved these, but because they were cheaper and available at the local market - for a while I was buying her generic biscuits.  Well, it turns out the poor dog has major food allergies! Now these are all I get for her.  She knew best!<br /><br />I recommend this product because it is a larger size than anything I've seen available through pet stores."
1,"Perfect for my 13 week old Lab who wants to chew on EVERYTHING.  Takes her quite a bit to get thru these which is why I bought the ""large"" size treat.  Healthy, cleans her teeth.  Highly recommend"
1,"I'm writing this review, however, if my dog could write it, or say it, she would positively rave about this treat! I have a 6-year-old Bichon Frise who loves these dog biscuits - or as she knows them, ""cookies""!  She loves the flavor of peanut butter, which is why I bought these originally to try. However, I was pleased to know that the other ingredients in these dog biscuits are oatmeal, eggs, apples and carrots and that everything is made natural. I want my dog to have good snacks (and food!) - and I want her to enjoy what she's eating, too. I have made my third purchase of this product as she loves them - she never hesitates to gobble the ""cookie"" quickly. She loves them and I know they're good for her - we're both happy! And to top it all off - the price is definitely right! I buy the mini-size as my dog is small. I highly recommend this high-quality dog treat!"
1,"Exceptionally wonderful transaction. There was a mix-up in items, but 1 contact with the seller & the issue was resolved so simply & easily. I'll tell you, if you have a mix-up, then you REALLY get to know how professional the seller is, and this one is top notch!"
1,"I used this last night by sprinkling some of this on pork chops along with the usual salt and pepper. It is a nice pick me up. I see this on anything really, roast potatoes, etc. If you like experimenting w/different foods and spices, this is an easy one to start with.  Then you can move up to fennel POLLEN, a bit pricier, but also good. I like this brand of spices b/c I have a toddler granddaughter that has serious food allergies to dairy, eggs, peanuts...this brand is totally free from those ingredients and others (wheat, fish, tree nuts, milk, soy) that can cause problems. No MSG, no artifical color, no preservatives, no sugar, non-GMO, non irradiated, and it's even kosher...what more can you ask for."
1,"My dog is a fussy eater. The small bites were perfect for her since she's only 6 1/2 pounds. I'd give it 5 stars if she woofed it down. She didn't but that's not unusual. She's picky.  However, if it weren't worth four stars she'd have not eaten it at all. :)"
1,I got my pup from the pound she came with good  quality dog food but she still itching a lot from what the vet said was dry skin. Our Vet said to try this brand but at Petco was about $18 per 5lb bag not on sale. I wish I had thought about looking into Amazon along time ago would have saved me a lot of time and money.<br />If switching your dog's food go half and half for a while.. I am sure everyone else knows this but in case :)
1,"I got this as a try out, before committing to a larger bag. Dogs love it, as they do all the products from this company. They have eaten the biscuits, and the meat rolls are gobbled up. The meat rolls help a lot with giving meds, as my dog is one smart cookie when it comes to meds. Anyway, I like this dog food in the small bites, as my older dog is having a hard time chewing. So with this, the bites are smaller and easier for her to break up, and sometimes she just swallows them without chewing, with no problem.The larger sizw also helps with her chewing as they are flat round pieces and easy for her to bite thru. I recommend this product for your pets."
1,"I have two small doggies and they both love this food.<br />I love all the benefits of the nutrition they get from it.<br />This is a highly recommended diet for any dog.<br />DMTJ W. Warwick, RI"
1,"This food used to come in a plastic package that was very good for keeping the product fresh.  Now the product comes in a lower quality bag that is not as good.  This food is formulated for small dogs and it takes about a month to eat through the full bag.  I am concerned that the food will be stale when we reach the end of the bag due to the lower quality packaging.  To be fair, the food itself is very good quality and my dog has been on it for 3 years with no problems."
0,"My dog HATES this dog food. She turns her head away from it and refuses to even put it in her mouth. I bought a 1-lb bag at a local pet store(I thought they were treats) and she LOVED it. But they were not small bites. There is something different between the regular and small bites. The only difference mentioned on the labels is duck, but my dog loves duck. So, it must be something else. I don't know what it is, but my dog knows. I bought this 5 lb. bag as treats to sprinkle on her more nutritional mainstay brand or to hand feed because she loved the one from the pet store so much. But I'm not even going to bother with this stuff. I figure there has to be a reason why the dog hates it. So, bottom line, I got bagged."
1,"These are delicious, handy snacks that are enjoyable, low calorie and fat- and sugar-free.  Because each serving is divided into many tasty chewy squares, it lasts a long time and makes the perfect take-along or any time snack.  Thank you, Matt!"
1,"I love these things!  Yes, they are expensive for a one ounce snack but only 40 calories a package!  Great snack to tide you over between meals.  The coconut sets the mood and transports you to Hawaii while the mango finish brings it all home!"
1,"I am on the SCD diet, and have been looking for snacks that I can take with me anywhere, and perhaps most importantly, taste good.  Matt's Munchies is definitely both! The flavors are really nice, and are reminiscent of the tropics. I disagree with a previous reviewer that there is too much coconut.  I feel the flavors are nicely balanced.  I love that they are packaged in bite size squares, as well.  I plan on ordering this regularly in the future!"
0,They were bad enough that I returned them. These are VERY expensive snacks. They should at least taste good. These tasted like they were old and stale. I don't recommend buying these. At lease not in the Island Mango flavor.
1,What a delicious treat! These are the BEST cashews I have ever had in my life! I will be a repeat customer!
0,"Received as a gift that I had researched/requested. Surprised that it contained 50% broken pieces (mostly tiny), where the photo online shows only whole nuts. Not recommended, unless you don't mind broken pieces."
1,"Loved these cashews. Vacumm packed, whole and full of flavor. Will order again. Shared with others that love cashews and they also agreed."
1,"Hugh.  Delicious.  Perfect for me.  Will buy again. Would make a great gift.  I had all whole cashews, no pieces."
1,"Canidae has definetly proven to be a tasty, balanced source of food for my dog.<br /><br />Initially i had started my new pup on IAMS because of its popularity - but after reading the ingredient list and hearing the the IAMS corporation had just been sold (therefore not keeping the quality of their product) I decided I needed to provide my hound with a heathier source of nutrition.<br /><br />I volunteer at the local Human Society Shelter and a friend of mine there suggested that I try ""Canidae"". At first I was hesitant because of the cost - but when i read the nutrition facts and saw REAL, all natural ingredients, i felt confident enough that the price was worth it.<br /><br />Before i started feeding my bassett Canidae he would only eat once a day (placing a full bowl of food down for him in the early morning on my way to work...he would wait until late at night to eat AFTER I had my dinner and slowly munch on a couple bits here and there). The first morning i put Canidae in his dish (at 5:30am) he scarfed the entire bowl down in a matter of minutes!!!!! It was such a relief to know that my dog was actually enjoying his food.<br /><br />Now i feed him once in the morning and once at night and he eats every bit as soon as I put it down everytime. Occasionally I will cook up some frozen vegetables with an egg and mix it in his food for a little variety, but I havent had to do that in a while.<br /><br />If you love your dog and care about his/her nutrition, I suggest giving Canidae a try."
1,"I feed three large dogs and one small dog with this dog food.  I've used it about three months.  Formerly I used a well-known brand that I assumed was good since it was well-known and readily available at stores everywhere.  I decided to change when I did some internet research showing my old brand was considered to have inferior ingredients.  I have to say that I have seen good reviews on the ingredients of this dog food, but I cannot say I notice anything in particular about my dogs since changing other than they seem to enjoy it more and seem to be satisfied with less of it.  Perhaps one dog who has skin problems is better, but I can't swear the dog food is the cause.  So, relying almost entirely on internet proclamation of quality, I give this a hearty recommendation.  And, the price is competitive to lesser rated dog foods.  And it comes directly to your door."
1,Both of my large breed dogs love Canidae.  I actually have to limit how much they can eat or they will make themselves sick by eating so much!  The ingredients are wonderful and actually contains stuff I would eat myself.  I would recommend this food for any animal lover.
1,"I bought the chicken meal and rice formula because I suspected my 8 year old Lab mix might have a food allergy related to corn or soy. Well, she does not. However I did learn a lot about dog food in the process. According to [...]  Canidae rates four stars whereas as everything on the shelf at my local Wal-Mart rates only one star. I was considering Blue Buffalo and other brands but they were $15 or higher in cost.<br />  I saved money buying Canidae and received dog food with the highest quality ingredients! I highly recommend it.<br />  One thing I must note. Some dog owners have reported reactions to changing to this brand. Although Canidae gives detailed instructions on their website on how to transition your dog to new dog food, they do not give these instructions on the bag. I strongly advise you to visit their website."
1,"I'm the owner of a year and a half old beagle boy.  He's the love of my life and when I got him from our local rescue they emphasized how important a proper diet of a premium dog food is.  I'm not one to be sucked into the belief that if it costs more, it's better.  That said, in terms of dog food, it's important to find a food made of fresh ingredients with no corn byproducts.<br /><br />My little guy eats a bowl of this per day and he has cured the constipation problem he was having before we switched foods.  He seems to really like the taste and to make it a little easier on his teeth, I add water to it to soften it.  That seems to do the trick since the kibbles are decent sized and might be a bit much for a smaller dog to take on.<br /><br />What's also nice about this is ordering through Amazon Prime and getting the heavy bag shipped for free to my door with two-day shipping.  This is by far the most reasonable price I've come across for a top-brand dog food.  Try a smaller bag to see if your pup takes to it and go from there."
1,"I ordered this after reading a ton of awesome reviews and in hopes that it may hope with my dog, Kitty, a 65 pound, 2 year-old pit bull's recent issues with her skin. It turns out that her problem was in fact due to corn and other fillers used in lesser quality dog foods (in this case, Purina One). Overall, this product alone made it completely worth the cost to subscribe to Amazon Prime for the extremely fast and cheap shipping, so for less money (as Kitty now requires less food, since she's more full from eating less of the higher quality food and we make sure to only feed her what the vet recommends,) I no longer have to drive to the store and pick up a 40 pound bag of dog food and load it into the back of one of my GTIs. So far, Kitty's been gaining weight and muscle at a pretty decent rate, in my opinion. (Over the past 2 months, she's gone from approximately 59 pounds to 67.5 pounds currently, and is quite fit and happy.) All this, is of course in addition to daily exercise, walks, et cetera, but her temperament lately has also been much better. On the lesser quality dog chow, she used to mope around the house every few days, but lately, she's been very happy, energetic and outgoing. She seems to be much less easily stressed out, which is great for her, as she tend to be a bit anxious, although an absolute sweetheart.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I could not recommend this or any other Canidae Dog Food product highly enough. By word of mouth at work alone, I've converted over ten people since switching at the beginning of the year (2011)."
1,Canidae Grain Free ALS Salmon formula is one of the foods I rotate for my two keeshonden girls. They love the taste and they have no digestive problems with it at all. Canidae grain free food is rated very highly by all the dog food rating sources I have found. Do your dogs a favor and try some.
1,"I would have spent the big bucks to order top-rated Blue Buffalo, but was shocked to learn that there was a recent wholesale recall of Blue Buffalo products. Canadae is much more inexpensive and just as nutritious. My dogs love it! They seem much healthier since I've switched to this brand. The folks that sell this are wonderful. Canadae was shipped to me free of charge (Amazon Prime.) It was carefully packaged: no rips, tears, or leaks. I highly recommend."
1,"I am not a dog, but my pug seems to like the food. I decided to choose this food because of the quality of the manufacturer. So far the dog loves the food, and the transition from the old to the new has not caused any problems. I also like the price of the food, and will continue to use this product."
1,"We have two dogs a standard poodle and a miniature poodle mix; both dogs are doing great on the Canidae dog food.  Both dogs readily eat the dog food.  Our miniature poodle mix tends to be fussy about food, but we have not had this problem with him eating the Canidae. We haven't had any issues with shipping or packaging.  The orders are here within a week to 10 days of ordering."
1,"We could not be happier with this food, we have two labs who had problems with their old food Nutra. Male would have diarrhea at least once a month and the female would have to be watched to make sure she would eat her food. We switched to this after a vet recommended a grain free formula to one of our friends labs who was having problems with his coat. After researching different food brands we decided to not purchase the science diet brand the vet recommend and we went ahead and ordered canidae salmon and potatoes. All the problems stopped as soon as we switched. Our male has no more accidents in the house and the female runs to her food when it is time to eat. They both have more energy and their coats look amazing. Great food and we recommend it to all of our friends and family for their pets. Our dogs health is worth the extra 20 dollars over the pet store brands of dog food."
1,"Hands down, this brand, or Blue Buffalo, are the best dog food out there, providing your pet doesn't need a special hypoallergenic brand of food because of illness or allergies.  Canidae use all natural, human grade ingredients in their foods.  My 3 pit bulls smash a bowl of this stuff and love it.  I recently switched my Blue pittie to the single grain formula however, because of persistent rashes she has been having lately (haven't been able to determine if it's all outdoor environmental and/or caused by a food allergy?)  She seems to do better on the single grain.  Nevertheless, I've been feeding my dogs this brand for over 4 years and am a very happy and loyal customer.  Even with the skyrocketing prices of grains and other foods, the price hasn't wavered in 4 years.  Not bad.  If you're feeding your dog trash like Science Diet or Eukanuba, switch over to this and you won't be disappointed.  Worth every penny."
1,My dog has a very sensitive digestive tract.  She's been in the hospital for severe diarrhea and vomiting.  We switched her to this Canidae food (as well as putting her on some meds and making sure she doesn't get outside food/treats) and she's done great since.  And she loves it.  We haven't had any issues with it what so ever.
1,"We have a 52lb Basset/Beagle/who knows. For the past few years Boing has eaten a grain free + low gluten dehydrated food. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QF363W"">Honest Kitchen Force, Grain-Free Dehydrated Raw Dog Food w/ Chicken, 10 Pound Box</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QW022C"">Honest Kitchen Keen, Low-Gluten Dehydrated Raw Dog Food w/ Turkey, 10 Pound Box</a>  But with finances compromised had to find a cheaper option & having completed extensive research decided to give Canidae a try. So far it's 50% HK & 50% Canidae while transitioning to the new food  & in the next two weeks he will be entirely on Canidae. I will update this review after a month to see if his wonderfully shiny coat remains like that & if he remains ""gas"" free. If so it will be a great find & tremendous saving. Unlike other dogs Boing did not experience the change of formula & so has not had the unfortunate stomach upsets. Another real plus was getting free shipping which helped with the overall cost. Due to health issues I have to be extremely careful of what he eats & as yet I have not seen any ill effects. Have given him the chicken grain free, this flavor & have 2 more to try. He isn't a finicky eater which helps. More in a month or so - hope this helps anyone looking for a decent alternative to the usual big name dog foods."
1,"My dog has had diarhea problems with all sorts of dog foods in the past.  We switched him to this a couple months ago and he is doing great.  This food was recommended by our pet store and I agree that it is not only healthy, but gentle on my dogs touchy stomach."
1,My dogs have been on this food for three years and are doing very well.
1,"This brand of dog food was recommended to us for our Black Lab, Sadie, as it is very healthy. She absolutely loves it, and her coat is very shiny. We can tell that this is good food, as she is very satisfied. Will definitely order this and possibly other flavors again."
1,"Ingredient wise.... one of the best dog foods in the market. Of course, a bit on the expensive side. Our 3 dogs love this food."
1,"I looked at.several diets for skin sensitive dogs.  Am already feeding a salmon diet and salmon oil bit wanted to mix.  The canidae has a good name, top ingredients and at time great price<br />Went to order another bag 1 mo later and price had changed by $6-$7 per bag.  Am now looking again."
1,"glad I got this, searched the web for the best food for a dog with stomach problems, loose stools, what I got at the vets didn't help, after reading many reviews I got this and I love it becaseu I feed less, they poop less, more money up front but less cost in the longer, also I get it delivered, what could be better, couldnt say anough good stuff, love you canidae"
1,Bought this a month ago and it seems to be working very well for my dogs and me.  My dogs can not have any wheat or corn and it is hard to find a dog food at a reasonable price that contains neither.  I'll keep ordering it.  It is handy to have it delivered to my door.
1,"At 40 per cent high quality protein, this is great food for a young, healthy, very active dog. It's hard to find food with that much protein. We've been through the wringer for 3 years with our German Shepherd's food needs. He was diagnosed at 1 year old with IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) and even though he is on medication, we have to be careful because anything less than top quality food will give him terrible diarrhea (no matter how slowly and carefully we transition him from one food to another). Even some top quality foods will do it.Since we put him on Canidae Pure Sea he's had consistently firm stool for the first time in his 3 years of life. His coat has gotten more soft and glossy, his breath is good (for a dog), he's put on and kept on some much-needed weight. We are so happy! He's also a picky eater, but he loves the Canidae and never turns his nose up at it.<br /><br />A couple of notes for any dog-savvy readers: we ruled out EPI and protein sensitivities early on. He's on Tylan and Immodium for the IBD, and most likely will be for life. The vet said that no matter WHAT we do, he will likely be subject to bouts of diarrea. That's why the Canidae seems so miraculous."
1,"I am feeding her this currently while mixing it with the Innova (which is very expensive and hard to find) that her breeder is feeding her. I love that the price is slightly less than other premium, holistic foods and I can get it shipped to me on Prime 2 day shipping.  It's also for all life stages, so I like that if this continues to work for her, I won't need to switch to a different food as she gets older.<br /><br />The ingredients in the food are great, and I especially like that there are pro-biotics.  Because the nutrients are so concentrated, I know that one of these 35 pound bags is going to last me a very long time with one growing puppy. At the same time, I had a difficult time getting her to eat the food (I guess it just didn't smell appealing to her).  I have had to mix it with a little pureed pumpkin and a tablespoon of the Canidae canned food of the same variety to make it a bit more appealing. At the same time, this could just have to do with my picky Lhasa-Shih's taste buds and not the food.  I know that several people who use the premium food are thrilled at the small amount of stool.  Personally, my puppy has still had larger stools at least twice a day (some of this could be from the Innova which she is being weaned off of).  Lhasa's are known for having sensitivities to allergens, and I love that this food is so gentle on her stomach.<br /><br />Mostly, I love that this is carried by Amazon and it can get to my house so quickly and easily. It is hard enough for me to pick up a 35 pound bag of dog food while I'm putting it in a plastic bin (let alone carrying home from the store as I live in a metropolitan area where I take public transit).  Great service and good product."
1,This is really good dog food and at a really good price. Way cheaper than at my local pet store. Can't beat this for good value.
1,switched over to this because of the new puppy.  all the dogs could eat the same food which was convenient.  just ordered the grain free from amazon as well in an attempt to avoid some skin allergies for my schnauzer.  we'll see.  great item!
1,"Our older dog has developed allergies and it's been hard to find a dog food that works for him. We were using Diamond Naturals, but I suspect they must have changed the formula because suddenly his allergies flared up and he ended up with an ear infection. We switched to this dog food and he LOVES it. Not only does he love it, but his ear infection is now gone and he's itching/scratching/chewing MUCH less.. We're grateful to have found it and hope they do not change the formula!"
1,"My three dogs like it a lot, and my problem dogs skin has improved dramatically.<br />His hair his growing back and his skin is not red and itchy anymore. I'vebtried the ""Blue"" dogfood and it didn't work at all."
0,"Our 6-year old Vizsla has been eating Canidae for 3 years. A month ago we switched flavors from Bison to Sea Salmon.  We gradually transitioned the change even though it was the same company.  Within four weeks on the new flavor he developed a set of distressing systems including soft, mucus covered stools, horrible gas,low energy, staggering walk, excessive drooling, licking and constant neck extending (difficulty swallowing).  A vet visit confirmed these as diet related.  We put him on a chicken/rice diet and his symptoms stopped after just two days.  Doing research to decide whether to switch back to bison or go with another company, I found a great deal of  information about other pet owners having issues with all flavors of food from Canidae. Consumer Affairs reports a pending class action suit.  We have decided to switch to another company."
1,The whole process was very smooth. We received the dog food in good condition and it arrived fasted than I would of thought. I'll order again.
1,My dog is allergic to poultry and it's hard to find products that are poultry free.  My local feed store recommended Canidae Lamb and Rice and it has done wonders for my dog.  Her coat is thicker and shinier.  She no longer itches and scratches/bites herself raw.  Plus she loves the food and it's very reasonably priced compaired to other dog foods that are poultry free.
1,"My two Rhodesian Ridgebacks and one Labrador Retriever are no pushovers.<br /><br />Even other varieties of highly regarded Canidae food have left them looking up at me over lightly rearranged bowls of food with that 'Why have you turned against us again?' look.<br /><br />But whenever I bring home the thirty-pound bags of Canidae Chicken Meal and Rice, the dogsters nose hungrily around the car before I can even get the stuff out of the trunk. I've long since settled on Canidae (for its reputation as nutritious and high-quality) and on the Chicken Meal and Rice (for the predictability factor with my threesome).<br /><br />Things just got better, however, when I realized that my Amazon Prime membership allows me to order a thirty-bound bag for second-day delivery at no cost (in fact, it usually arrives the next day) at a price lower than what I was paying locally.<br /><br />This has allowed me to move to a just-in-time delivery service, which cuts down on the storage needs and may be attractive for other owners of multiple and/or large dogs."
1,"Since using this product my dogs coat has improved soooooo much.  He loves it.  He does have fish breath, but his health is has improved."
1,"I've been feeding my dog (75 pound Golden mix, about 5 years old) Canidae for 3-4 days now, and she absolutely loves it! She's always been a picky eater, often ignoring food in her bowl, but she laps this up as soon as I put it in.  I've been mixing it with her old food to ease her into the transition.  For the first two days I did 75% old food, 25% Canidae.  Today I've done half and half.  No tummy problems.  If anything she seems to have more energy.  The only thing is that now I have to really police how much food I give her, whereas with her old food I knew she would only eat it if she were hungry. But I'm happy she's happy! I'm also happy to have found a food that seems to be much better quality, and for a price that's within my tight budget."
1,"Great product and quick shipping!<br />My dog really loves this food! She is allergic to wheat, of which this has none, and is a very picky eater but loves this food!"
1,This product is made from the best ingredients.  My dog was allergic to chicken-based dog foods so my vet suggested salmon.  This is a quality salmon dog food without a strong fishy odor.
1,"My Boxer have tried various dog foods. He started with Nutro as a puppy but after a year, he started not liking his food so we switched to Science Diet. After much research, found that Science Diet did not use the quality products... so we switched to Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Adult Dog food. My dog loved the food but realized he had allergies to one of the ingredients. So we changed to Canidae and he loves this and has no allergies.<br /><br />When My husband and I researched good quality dog food, we found a lot of great quality dog food and most of them were pretty pricy but we found Canidae and Chicken Soup to be the best quality for a good price. I would recommend Canidae Lamb Meal and Brown Rice to any dog owners. My dog has been on it for about 6 months now and its been great!"
1,"Our Rhodesian Ridgebacks were on this food some years back and we moved, thus losing access to it at the new location. I am very glad to see Amazon carrying Canidae and that it's available using the Prime Membership! We have fed many, many dogs the Canidae when we we were fostering rescue dogs (an average of 3 new dogs a month for years) and it was the only food NONE of them ever had any trouble eating & digesting. Our own pack has a couple of members with soy allergies, so I'm careful about what we feed. They have been back on the Canidae for a few months now with no drama at all. The switch from their old food back to the Canidae was easy and stress free and all 6 dogs scarf it down like it was prime rib. (or you know...a squirrel) Even my father's Chihuahua likes it and that little diva used to think she could only eat human food! I have been able to cut back by a half cup on the daily ration for our largest dog as he was putting extra weight on with his previous amount from the old food. Everyone's coat is soft and shiny, they all have loads of energy and are generally in excellent overall health - that doesn't happen with the grocery store bargain foods. Again, I am VERY VERY glad to see the big bags of Canidae available from Amazon!!"
1,"Our dog loves this brand. We used their Chicken & Rice formula for about a year & decided to switch to the Lamb & rice one after our dogs interest-level started going down. How did we find out?  We realized that over time we have been mixing more treats in her food to get her to eat it  (This with only 2 meals a day!)<br /><br />Our dog definitely preferred lamb over the chicken, no more treat mix-in's, only pure dog-food!<br /><br />We = Canidae fans for life!"
1,My female bulldog has skin allergies and this product really helps her condition.  This is a good price for it with free shipping.
1,"Buying Canidae thru Amazon is truly one of today's best bargains.  Plus, Mr. UPS carries the 30 pound bag up my stairs!"
0,"I should've done more research before buying this product. My dog seemed to have very little appetite when she was on this food. She had skin problems. She had loose stools. Unfortunately I didn't want to believe that it had anything to do with the food. I finally decided to look into it after months of trying to get her to eat it more regularly and found that my problems weren't uncommon with this food. I've since switched her to Blue Buffalo food and her skin problems have gotten better, she has become more energetic, her stools are no longer loose and she happily eats."
0,"My dog got horrible diarrhea from it.<br />We mixed it with her old food for about a week and after that gave her just the Canidea food.<br />Too bad, it seemed like a good brand though."
1,"It just came in, and to my disappointment, it contains barley...which she is allergic to.  That is NOT on the ingredient list, so beware.  Fortunately my other dog can eat this.<br /><br />Amazon, please keep the ingredients up to date!"
0,"Canidae has changed the formula of their ALS recipes.  Many, many dogs have become ill after eating the new formula.  The web is full of complaints from dog owners whose dogs are experiencing the same awful symptoms (Diarrhea, vomiting, itching, hot spots and even seizures).  Do your homework before buying this product.  The company changed the formula without notifying the public.  Would give zero stars if possible."
1,My Weimeraner loves Canidae dry food.  It's healthy for her and leaves her always wanting more.  Highly recommend it and it's worth the cost.
0,"I've heard this is a good food, but was shocked to see after chicken meal so many grains. I did not feed this to my dog. I'd rather pay more money for better quality food. All those fillers are unneeded. I expect such a highly regarded company to have better ingredients. I always look for by products but didn't think to even bother to check the next 4 ingredients. Highly disappointed."
0,"This has given my young dog persistent loose stools. My older dog also had problems with loose stools on the adult formula, which was immediately rectified by a change to Innova. See the large number of serious complaints on the web about the new formulation before buying."
0,"I have a two and a half year old female Boxer that has allergies to most commercial dog foods, so I keep her on a diet free of wheat, soy, and animal by-products.  Canidae seemed to fit the criteria and was available at my local pet store (whereas, the brand I was feeding, Evo, had to be ordered), so I wanted to try it.  I've been feeding my dog three and a half cups of Canidae dry dog food daily (divided between two feedings) for about five weeks, and she has lost a significant amount of weight on this diet.  She is a very active dog that has always been lean, but she is now too skinny. I will be switching back to Evo and would not recommend Canidae."
0,"I purchased Canidae Dry Dog Food, Chicken Meal and Rice Formula for my two Cocker Spaniels (Cavalier King Charles and American breed).  After about two weeks, the problems began.  Diarrhea, some vomiting and general malaise.  Further feeding resulted in more problems.  We had fed them Blue Buffalo and Eukanuba in the past but had never experienced these kind of problems. We returned to Eukahuba and both pets have returned to normal. I'm unsure what ingredients caused the problem but I will never use this product again and recommend caution before feeding your dog this food!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EGZ2L2"">Canidae Dry Dog Food, Chicken Meal and Rice Formula, 30-Pound Bag</a>"
1,"Loved the taste, the smell, everything. Better than what I used to make myself years ago.<br /><br />And the BEST delivery from a second party shipper that I have ever received. Many thanks !<br /><br />Buy this applesauce, you will NOT be disappointed."
1,"Some of the best coffee out there, as good if not better than Seattle's Best and Starbuck.  Good deal price wise if you order it on subscription which I do.<br />smooth, rich coffee, I prefer the Breakfast Blend better than this colombia blend and that is what I changed to!"
1,"For colombian ground coffee lovers , this is a brand you will really love and you wont be sorry at all for purchasing it"
1,"I really love this brand of coffee, I am a coffee nut and enjoy drinking this, it is nice and smooth and great tasting you can not go wrong with this choice."
1,"Community Coffee Colombia Classico is a standard quality, everyday-type Columbia coffee. It is comparable to Eight O'clock Columbia coffee. It has a good aroma when you first open the bag & one tablespoon per cup results in a decent strength coffee in a typical drip coffeemaker. It's not a premium coffee, but becomes a good value at a discount price."
1,"Community coffee is the best brand of coffee made.  Being from Louisiana and driving passed the Community coffee processing plant and smelling the coffee being roasted is an experience one never forgets.  I have drank this brand all of my adult life and there is none to compare with it.  I have drank all of the varieties of this brand and dark roast was my favorite until----i tried the Columbia Classico Blend and now at 62 i have a new favorite.  It has a sweeter taste than the other varieties, not quiet as strong as the dark roast, but strong enough to be ""real"" coffee.  I love it and so glad i tried it. Thanks Amazon for carring it and especially having it on a subscribe and save plan."
0,I bought since it seemed like a great deal but when i made a batch it was awful. It had a weak taste and the aroma was as if it was old coffee. Completely disappointing i love trying all coffees and expected more from this. Will never buy again. I thought i would never have to say this but Dunkin Doughnuts is way superior so try that first. Seattle Best is a great coffee as well.
1,"i think that's the best ground coffee in a bag can do. much better than the store brands like Maxwell House or Folgers or Wegmans, etc. when it's on sale they are actually about the same price. would definitely try this brand again!<br /><br />This flavor is on the strong and bold side, which I like."
1,Good price for Community Coffee pack of 3.  Received quickly.  Product packages were sealed but not firm bricks like I expected. I will say that the flavor was not compromised by that.  Will probably order these again.
1,This is very good coffee. I will definitely purchase it again. It is robust and flavorful without any trace of bitterness. Love it!
0,"Weak, dry, tasteless coffee.  Doesn't taste even remotely like it was made with Columbian Arabica beans.  The grind was also of very poor quality.<br /><br />How bad was it?  This stuff makes Folger's seem like premium, high grade stuff.  I have no earthly idea how people give this Community Colombian Classico such a high rating.  Perhaps I just got a bad batch of very old stuff from Amazon but I'll not be giving this coffee a second chance!  Probably one of the weakest and most tasteless coffee beans I've ever bought."
1,"I don't know if the name ""Community Coffee"" is intended to convey a coffee for the masses, but that's kinda how I would rate it. It smells good when you open the package, you use a normal amount to brew, it has a good flavor & aroma. No disappointments, but nothing special. I have a hard time distinguishing this from other typical brands of columbian coffee . . . no worse, no better."
0,"In my case, a half of the cans were smashed.  I'm not saying that the can was destroyed.  Also, it was within the expiration date.  However, foods in some of the cans were discolored...must be getting old.<br /><br />So technically speaking, there are nothing 'wrong' with them...  But made me keep wondering if they are safe.  So for a peace of mind, I decided not to order this product again."
0,2 of the six cans were smashed when received - maybe they should pack them better for shipment or not send smashed cans
0,The Taste of this Chocolate almost made me pack up my Keurig and take it Back to the store! I purchased this Hot Cocoa out of excitement when I brought my Mr. Coffee Keurig on sale for Black Friday.  I am an avid hot cocoa drinker and this by far is the worst tasting chocolate in my opinion. It was watery and had an awful artificial sweetener aftertaste. Granted the first time I did not shake the K-cup as directed so I gave it a second try after shaking. Surprisingly it didn't do a d@mn thing to help the taste! On the bright side if you long for a watered down artificial sweetener as an after taste in a drink then this is the K-cup for you.
0,Recently tried this milk chocolate k cup from Amazon. The only thing this drink has in common with chocolate is its color.Of the 13 items listed as ingredients  cocoa is number 8.It has a chemical smell and a chemical taste.If you buy this junk don't say you were not warned. It does not deserve ANY stars.
1,"I love this stuff!  We make it at the 8oz setting on our Cuisinart K-cup machine, and then add frothed, steamed milk from the Aerochino frother.  Makes a wonderful hot-chocolate latte.  The chocolate is very good by itself, as well, although we like to add a least a splash of milk (or whipped cream) to thicken up the body a little."
1,"This is excellent hot chocolate, and I will buy this again<br />and recommend it highly.  Very good flavor, very smooth<br />and actually tastes like chocolate."
0,Our family loves to have hot chocolate on a cold winter's day and this is not hot chocolate.  I don't know what it is.  You need to find another product for your Keurig if you are looking for hot chocolate.  Please do not waste your money on this product.  There is no quality control on this one.  How Keurig thinks this is good is beyond me.
1,"I prefer dark chocolate, but this has a good taste. I'm happy with it, even though it is milk chocolate."
0,"Absolutely horrible, I have never had such terrible hot cocoa, very artificial taste .  It's going back!,  Waste of $13!"
0,"The aftertaste from the artificial sweetener is terrible!  Waste of money, as the box makes no mention that it's full of nastiness.  Yuck yuck yuck. I can still taste the chemical aftertaste and it's been at least 30 minutes!  It tastes like I've sucked on a penny!<br />You've been warned.  I honestly don't understand the 4 & 5 star reviews... It's such a bitter, strong aftertaste!"
0,"Cafe Escapes Milk Chocolate Hot Cocoa for the Keurig is for the birds. I am truly sorry about this guys but it was nothing more than chocolate flavored water. This probably is not your fault since it is made with water. However, I can tell you that the very first company that can produce a hot chocolate made with water that actually tastes like a full bodied hot chocolate will be millionaires. Put a little body to the chocolate and you will have a true winner!"
1,I love the product and found mixing it with flavored coffees gave the latte effect for 1/4 of the price
1,This is the best and I have tried them all.  My least fave is Green Mountain (bitter). 7 oz. Is my perfect blend. I always add about 10 mini freeze-dried marshmallows....yummy!
1,Came quickly and was just what we expected. Great job having a product that most everyone else on the web was out of.
0,"As others have said, it has the chemical taste of artificial sweetener. When will these companies realize that there are a ton of consumers out there who do NOT like sugar substitutes!"
1,THIS HOT COCOA IS THE BEST AND FOR SOME<br />REASON IT IS VERY HARD TO FINE .SO I STOCKED UP<br />IT HAS A CREAMY COCOA TASTE I HAVE TRY OTHERS AND<br />ALL OF US AT WORK LOVE THIS COCOA.<br />  THANK YOU AMAZON FOR HAVEING IT FOR US.<br />  SHERRY1530
0,"This was the first k-cup I tried out with my Keurig coffee maker, and while good it had a weird metallic aftertaste. At first I thought it was because the coffee maker was new, but i'm still getting that weird taste after many other brews later. If you don't have sensitive taste buds it's great, but if you do.. stick with the Green Mountain Hot Chocolate."
1,"Wonderful hot cocoa! Great flavor, its very important to shake the cup before brewing and to use the right cup setting. Will definitely buy again!"
0,"I found the taste way too sweet for me. I tried it with less water, more water, added creamer, still could not shake the taste. Very disappointing. Only used it at the office anyway so I am sticking with Swiss Miss packages for my hot chocolate fix."
0,"Incredibly disappointed with this product. Tastes nothing like hot cocoa, just watered down. The sucralose gives it a chemical aftertaste."
0,"I normally drink coffee in my keurig but I tried these for something different. They tasted almost like the weak hot chocolate you get out at an amusement park from a machine or something. I would not recommend them. I have a machine that lets you pick what size cup you want, small or medium and even on the small the hot chocolate is watery."
0,I was really excited to try hot cocoa in the Keurig - but these are just awful.  We tried adding creamer but that didn't really help either.  Definitely won't be purchasing again!
0,"I am a hot chocolate freak.  I was very anxious to try the varieties of hot chocolate with my new Keurig.  This cocoa was my first purchase.  It was so terrible I almost brought it back.  First, it took half the box to get the plastic taste out of the drink. A Keurig issue.  That last half of the box didn't redeem itself.  This cocoa tastes like flavored water, flavored with diet sugar.  It has the same aftertaste you would get with a diet soda or a sugar-free yogurt.  Also, you can't get more than 8 oz per cup. If you do, the taste just gets more watered down. A huge disappointment.  I will be trying other brands but my expectations are very low based on this first experience.<br /><br />I read a few reviews and learned that this product contains sucralose.  It is not listed as an ingredient.  Explains the diet taste plus I don't trust manufacturers who pull stunts like this.  The manufacturer is Green Mountain Coffee - very disappointing."
0,"This is probably one of the worst hot chocolate brands I have ever purchased.  It is one of those things that has a ""something is wrong but I'm not exactly sure what"" kind of taste.  In some ways the flavor is like chocolate water.  In others it is more like carob. It just tastes fake.  I will not ever purchase this brand again."
0,I agree with the other one-star reviews. It has a strange flavor unlike chocolate and more like chemicals. It's watery. I will try a different brand of hot chocolate or just use my personal K cup to put in my own hot chocolate mixes.
0,"I'm not an avid coffee drinker, so when I bought my Keurig I really had my eye on the other drink types (teas, cocoas, hot cider.)  These was the first hot chocolate k cup, and I'm sorry to say that I don't like them at all.  The drink is watery, and has a strange after taste.  I hope one of the other hot chocolate k cups are better than this."
0,"Don't waste your money! Garage sales this summer will be full of this crap. This is the worst hot cocoa I have ever tasted in my life. Tried it a second time ,thought I didn't make it right. Couldn't sleep all night & today I'm sick to my stomach. It is full of chemicals, not real food. Why would anyone want to waste there hard earned money on something that could possibly do you in!"
0,Tastes like chocolate water with artificial sweetener.  Really not worth drinking.  The changes in formula necessary to make cocoa mix fit into the little cup really ruin it.
0,"Thankfully this came in a variety pack, so I only had one.  But god, was it nasty.  I'd already been told by a family member not to go with the ""large"" setting on my Keurig, as it could make cocoa taste watery.  So I dutifully chose ""medium,"" and oh, how I wish watery were the problem.  It had such a horrible bitter taste that I at first thought my water had somehow been contaminated.  After reading other reviews here, I realize that it must be the sucralose.  I consider it not only very misleading advertisting for each cup not to be labeled as ""diet"" in some way, but sucralose also happens to be my least favorite of the major artificial sweeteners.  I don't know what the calorie count on these things would be, but if it happens to be low then I'd recommend trying this only if you're dieting and really desperate.  For people wanting a normal hot cocoa taste, avoid at all costs."
0,"This product is very bland. I got it because my kids love hot chocolate, and usually they use my keurig just for hot water to mix their own hot chocolate. They were so excited to get this, but they didn't even drink their first cup of it because it has almost no chocolate flavor. I had to mix chocolate syrup in with it to give it any kind of flavor at all."
0,"I got a bunch of these from a friend and wondered about the bad after taste. It wasn't like products completely flavored with Splenda (sucrolose) but it still a slight strange taste (I describe it as slimy) and left that after taste in my mouth. On the k-cup it self, it doesn't say it has artificial sweeteners or is diet, so I came to the internet and it is almost impossible to find the ingredients listed any where. The reviews were the confirmation at first. Too much Splenda makes me sick to my stomach so I know it is not good for me. Too much is more than a few tastes. Oh well, I guess I'll try the Grove Square or Swiss Mix as those are the only others I can find.<br /><br />I find the taste of this product unappealing and the after taste sickening."
1,THIS HOT CHOCOLATE IS BETTER THEN THE GREEN MOUTAIN ONE. MY KIDS ENJOY THE EASE OF MAKING THEIR OWN HOT CHOCOLATE. THIS IS THE BEST ONE TO BUY
0,I made 6 oz cup of this and it tasted awful.  It lacked milk chocolate flavor and was very watered down.  I was very disappointed because hot cocoa was the main beverage I wanted to brew since I do not drink coffee.  This was very bad.
0,"I tried the Cafe Escapes Milk Chocolate Hot Cocoa Keurig K-Cups and the Cafe Escapes Chai Latte. I like sweet things, but both of these are seriously way too sweet. The Chai Latte has a much more pronounced artificial sweetener flavor and aftertaste, but this too has the same artificial sweetener flavor. Not good at all."
0,"We bought this KCUP because we wanted some hot cocoa around. It is completely watered down and lacks a lot of the chocolate flavor each time. If you like rich hot cocoa, this is not the hot cocoa for you."
1,I bought these for the kids and they love them.  Since it comes out too hot for them we put two ice cubes in the coffee cup and brew the hot chocolate on the 4oz size cup right over the ice.  It comes out at the perfect temperature for kids.
1,"I ordered this hot cocoa on the basis of several good reviews on Amazon, and I'll add my own to that stack.  The cocoa is very tasty by itself.  I would love to get a foamer as suggested in some of the other reviews and try mixing it with foamed milk, I'll bet that's great!<br /><br />I also ran a Small cup of bold coffee with a Small cup of this (50/50 mix) and liked it a lot."
1,"With winter approaching I bought this as a trial.  I was concerned that it would taste watered down because I feel that many of the Keuring coffees taste that way; I like the extra bold varieties or Starbucks Italian Roast on my own K cup.<br /><br />I was actually rather pleasantly surprised as to how much like real hot cocoa it tasted.  Not watered down and not too sweet.  It's not gourmet but this winter, when you want a quick cup of hot cocoa after shoveling snow or playing outside, this will do nicely."
0,This tastes terrible. Even the powdered hot cocoa mixes where you can pour hot water taste a lot better (and cheaper)!
0,"Honestly, was not was what I was expecting when I ordered - it was bitter and tasted like splenda! Delivery was great, received order on time etc - but the product itself was disgusting - I couldn't even give it away at work! I left it in the break room at work and it went untouched!"
1,"This is really good, especially at the 8 oz. setting. The review for muddy water must have been a bad batch or some other brand of k-cup cocoa this is great. The only downfall is the price :("
1,"This is one of the best products for the K-cups system. The hot chocolate is just right, not too sweet, very rich and creamy and full bodied. I like that it does not have a sodium flavor like many instant hot chocolates do. Add a few drops of milk or 1/2 & 1/2 and it is awesome."
1,"Back when I made my first cup (last year), it was indeed watery.  I thought how it would be nice if so much chocolate wasn't left in the k-cup after brewing (yes, I removed the foil, to recycle the cup).  I decided to shake the cup before inserting into the Keurig, and I'll remove it and re-insert after twisting it 180°, giving it another hole to brew from, which DOES help.  I prefer the taste of this to Swiss Miss or Nestle for sure.  I also add Vanilla or Irish Creme powdered CoffeeMate creamer which thickens it up a bit, or will add some Bailey's or Amaretto after shovelling show.  I like the Dark Chocolate version as well."
1,"We are pleased with these hot chocolate k cups.  Rich milk chocolate taste, not too strong or too weak, just about right.  A good addition to our k cup collection."
1,"I've tried a couple different Hot Chocolate K-cups and so far I think we like this one the best.  We love having it around so we can give the kids hot chocolate, or just curl up as the weather gets cooler and make a cup ourselves.  It's chocolatey but if it tastes too watered down like some suggest, then just set your settings to a smaller cup size.<br /><br />For us, it's just right!  Creamy, chocolatey, warm and delicious!  Give it a try if you like K-cups and hot chocolate!  Why not?  There are great k-cups coming up for the winter months, and this one is definitely going to stay stocked throughout the winter.  YUM!"
0,"This tasted, watery and I used the smallest amount of water you can use with a k cup - 6 oz. The chocolate was flavorless but mostly it was just super weak.  I do not recommend."
1,"Beautiful plants--I ended up not getting one of each kind, but each plant arrived well-wrapped and labeled.  They were healthy and happy after a good soak once they arrived.  They're lovely and I'm so glad to have ordered them."
1,I am a plant killer! However these beautiful little plants have made it in my house for six months now. Most plants only make it 2 months in my home. They are easy to care for and very hardy. They look great hanging in my frt kitchen window. Thay came wrapped very nice and safe and a few of them are already blooming and changing colors. I cant believe I actually found a LIVE plant I cant kill!!!!
0,These plants looked dead and were very small.  I watered them as directed and they still look the same.  I've had them for a few weeks and follow the directions every time I water them.
1,"I bought several plants and terrariums. All of my plants arrived in a very short time, in excellent condition & healthy, each were indivduallly wrapped & labeled.  The glass terrariums were perfectly wrapped to protect them and individually boxed, but best of all, this is the most Affordable shop I've found for these things.<br /> I recommend this shop to everyone !!!  ;-)<br />Thanks a lot,<br />Ms Bowers"
1,I received my tillandsia plants today and they are exactly as promised. I ordered them on Friday afternoon and they were in my po box on Monday morning. I'm having a blast trying to decide which container or seashell or candlestick to display them on.
1,Great plant option for those who want something low maintenence. Look great in glass globes or shells or just sitting in sills. Exactly as pictured!
1,"great purchase, very nicely packaged.  arrival was very fast, maybe 2 days after order was placed.  very clear and concice instructions included.  couldn't be happier!"
1,I have seen these little air plants at Farmer's Markets and Organic/Local stores. They really are cute and the instructions were easy to follow. Since I have other plants I am sure I won't have issues remembering to water them once a week. Packaged so nicely with a nice handwritten note which is always a pleasure to receive when buying a product. Nice personal touch.
1,"I didn't expect these Air Plants to be prettier than the photos but they are! Healthy as can be, no wilting or dead areas. You can put these in a crowded room and they steal the show anyway. These are my first Air Plants. I am impressed. This type of gardening couldn't be easier.  The shipping was fast and inside the package is all the information you'll need. I had some sea shells packed away and now they have a purpose.  Absolutely adorable ! I will order again from The Air Plant Shop.com on Amazon."
1,These were combine shipped with Spanish moss that I also ordered.<br /><br />Just got these. I can't tell if they're alive yet.<br /><br />Will update later...
0,"I love these candies.... However, the entire case was ruined, not one piece was not damaged, obviously they had melted either prior or during shipping. The chocolate was stuck to the top of the paper they are wrapped in. . They were still edible, but didn't quite taste the same, the chocolate was gooey instead of solid, even days later when stored at room temperature. They really disappointed me :( So I am hoping the next case I purchase will be fresh, as I am ordering in October a cooler month, and hoping it was ruined in delivery and not the sellers storage."
1,After learning this was my boyfriends favorite candy I just knew it would make a perfect anniversary gift. He was absolutely stunned! Not only did he love it but his mom now tries to steal some( after she figures out where he hides it). I will definently be buying this again.
1,WAS GREAT HOW FAST THE PRODUCT GOT HERE.  I HAVE NEVER HAD A PRODUCT GET HERE THAT FAST.  WAS PLEASED TO HAVE THE CANDY HERE ONLY PROBLEM WAS IT HAD MELTED BUT WE ARE STILL EATING IT.  THANKS AGAIN FOR BRINGING BACK A MEMORY FROM WHEN I WAS OVERSEAS IN THE ARMY.
1,"My friend brought me this candy from Germany once, and ever since I've been hooked.  They are simply delicious and it's hard to just eat one!  The picture on Amazon is outdated though...The candy looks the same, but the packaging has been updated."
0,"I purchased this tea at a retail store. I was terribly, terribly disappointed. It didn't taste bad...it tasted like nothing at all. I wasn't expecting a strong taste but the tea bags don't even smell like anything. Literally...nothing. They are the nice fabric-bag type tea bags. This was my first experience with this brand...maybe their other flavors are better."
1,This product arrived in about three days.  Never use the entire packet for one recipe unless you like hot seasonings!  It is extremely hot.
1,"This bread works perfect with soup or by itself. Really a wonderful, full flavored bread. I put the mix in my bread maker on the basic setting and then out came another hit from The Prepared Pantry!"
1,Went looking for bread especially for bread machines. Was very glad I ordered this product. Tasted great and the family loved it. Product arrived quickly and was fresh.
0,"We've used Splenda and Kirkland brand sucralose packets. either product is very good for what it is, a no-calorie sweetener for hot or cold drinks, desserts, and breakfast cereal.<br />For convenience, rather than the best price, I purchased this 2000-packet box of real Splenda-brand from Amazon. After using the product for a few days, i noticed my wife replaced her normal morning ice coffee with diet soda. She couldn't stand the Splenda, it was giving her a dry mouth and bad taste. i had noticed something a little ""off"" but just dismissed it as my imagination. Later i tried a sample straight from the envelope, it had a very acrid taste and seemed to burn -- it certainly wasn't SWEET. i then did a blind taste test using a new, small box that i bought from a local grocery store. night and day difference.  in summary, i think i got either an old/expired box (there's no obvious expiration date on the box), or the product might have soaked up an odor/taste from something during transit."
1,"I and my wife use this product more than 15 years and totally satisfied with it. Before this product i use Sugar Free,Sweet n Law,Equal but the test is not like splenda. There are bitter test in Equal and other product. I am 58 Years Old and with weight and blood Pressure.<br />I like this feature from Splenda:<br />They are a great way to sweeten beverages and can be sprinkled on cereal, fresh fruit, and more.<br /><br />Each packet of Splenda provides the same sweetness as two teaspoons of sugar.<br />Each packet has less than 1 gram of carbohydrate and less than 5 calories, which meets FDA's standards for no-calorie foods.<br />24 packets of Splenda provide the same sweetness as one cup of sugar."
1,"Splenda is the way to go and buying it in bulk like this saves a lot of money. The cost really racks up when you get at the grocery store.<br /><br />I've ordered this a few times and will order it again when I need a refill<br /><br />If you're going to buy this do NOT purchase it if it's being sold by ""segouna."" After over charging for shipping, she takes a week to email that it was shipped. But she hasn't actually shipped it [but you don't know this]. So you wait and wait and email and email. She only responds to email sent through Amazon.com, never to email sent through your personal email. Then a few weeks later she claims she can't find any tracking information on the original package. A few days after that she finally sends you your purchase, but only if you threaten to report her to Amazon."
1,I always end up using a lot of this for a variety of things & this is convient for me to have on hand instead of a large quantity of small boxes.
0,As I reported to Amazon previously the packaging was terrible. alot of loose sugar inside the box. When I opened the shipping carton My wife and I noticed the original Splenda box was not properly sealed. The Splenda box was literally unsealed and open. It made us leary to think that someone might have tampered with the shipment. As of today no harm has come. The sugar is the same. The quantity is wonderful. The price well I've seen it for less.
1,"On this particular deal one gets the best artificial sweetener at the best price in a large quantity with exceedingly fast shipping, no reason to try another."
1,Hard to get excited about Splenda but hey it was a good value and arrived at my door quickly. Feel confident ordering here.
1,"I do not live in the United States, and I am used of Splenda, and where I live nowadays, splenda is very expensive and not easy to find, and I found out that if I order it online from Amazon.com, I will get it much cheaper than where I live."
1,I have used Splenda sweetener for many years.  It doesn't have the aftertaste some other sweeteners have.  It has been difficult to find it in quantities of more than 200 packets.  This box of 2000 is a great value at about half the price per packet I  had been paying.
1,No fancy box just great price. I had always purchased large amount of Splenda at wholesale club now I can buy it from Amazon at even better price with free shipping and no member fee.
1,"being a type 11 diabetic i have to avoid sugar,<br />splenda was the reccommended choice at the hospital<br />and i am now completely sold on this product.<br />a REALLY great amazon value helps alot also"
1,"Splenda is by far the most accurate tasting sugar substitute available.  I bought these packets and have been using them for years.  These are great on cereal too, for example turning ordinary corn flakes into frosted flakes without heaps of sugar and extra calories."
1,"Wal-mart gets about $14.97 for a 400 pack, do the math, every dollar counts when you on a fixed income like me."
1,"Splenda is Splenda.  The quantity for the price was the sole reason for buying this product.  With Splenda packets, I go for the pricing.  I only use Splenda in my coffee."
1,"when i turned 30 i cut sugar out of my diet purely as a health maintenance measure.  now in my 40's my blood pressure, BMI, cholesterol and blood sugar continue to be healthy for my age and height, despite being inactive.  so something has got to change if you want to stay healthy - lifestyle or diet, but preferable both if you can manage it.  i use about 20 Splenda packets per day in my beverages.  I have tried all other sweeteners for at least a week each, and while I'd like to support Stevia use - I just could not handle it's leafy taste even in my ice tea, which is already leafy.<br />i was concerned that may be too much since many web sights warn of aluminum buildup in your liver - so i contacted Cargill and tried to find out what amounts of Splenda did their human trails involve - but they would not tell me - only said there is no consumption limit.  that's why I took a star off my review - i wish Splenda's maker would be more forthcoming when a consumer contacts them with a legitimate concern.  if you can tolerate sugar, when making a gallon of beverage, add one tablespoon of sugar per 16 grams of Splenda, to soften the metallic taste of this sweetener."
1,"Some will snicker or roll their eyes at the title, but maybe those can relate to say...running out of ketchup. And there were an additional 200 packets in each box of 1000 that I didn't even expect. Would certainly repeat this purchase when the time comes."
1,"Best deal...IF you use a lot. As a insulin dependant person who uses it in ALL my cooking, it saves me about $50 a month over store prices. (I usually get about 2 month's out of a box.) I.E. use about 40 packs a day. (I said I use it in ALL my cooking!)"
1,This was the best deal on Splenda that I've found.  It was shipped fast and I have been dipping into it ever since it arrived.  I have given up on sugar and this fit's the bill better then the other substitutes.<br />Seller had item shipped rather quickly.  It was as advertised.
1,"I could not use any of the not-to-be-named pre-Splenda sweeteners. I simply could not tolerate their taste AND the after-taste. I've been a Splenda user ever since it became available because... well... the taste is VERY close to sugar's own and, as far as I know, there are NO side effects.<br /><br />My understanding of the Splenda technology is that the process starts with what is supposed to be a 'sugar' molecule and then ONE atom is replaced with another which makes it impossible to digest so it simply passes through your digestive tract. You get zero calories, good taste and no side effects.<br /><br />So... what's not to like? The price? That's were the wisdom of buying these large but not too heavy Splenda boxes comes from. Buy in bulk and save :)<br /><br />I NEVER put anything sweet into my tea or my coffee - a habit I probably developed during those dark, sad, pre-Splenda days - but, when it comes to Cappuccino... it's a different story. I am reaching for the little yellow packets. A box of these lasts me for a long, long time."

1,We use a lot of Splenda and this is a great buy.  The product came quickly and in good condition.
1,Es la segunda vez que compro con este proveedor y el margen de error en las bolsas empacadas es del 2.5% aunque en este &uacute;ltimo pedido lleg&oacute; en un mejor estado.
1,I USE SPLENDA PACKETS EVERY SINGLE DAY. LOVE THIS PRODUCT AS IT IS CALORIE FREE AND EASY TO USE. ALSO DIABETIC FRIENDLY. I WATCH FOR IT TO GO ON SALE A LOT AS WE USE A LOT
1,"Mrs. Butterworth's Waffle Mix / B002J997RC<br /><br />I love, love, love this waffle mix. Seriously, all other waffle mixes just taste like sand to me, but Mrs. Butterworth's is so sweet and tasty. I've eaten Mrs. Butterworth's since I was a kid, so that may be part of it, but since I've introduced my fianc&eacute; to this mix, he can't seem to get enough of it, so it must not just be me. And it's SO easy to make - a touch of vegetable or canola oil, some water, and a waffle iron is all you need. No eggs, no milk, nothing perishable that you might not have on hand at the moment.<br /><br />What I can't understand is why none of my local stores seem to carry this mix anymore. Pinnacle Foods is apparently still making this mix, but no one seems to carry it in my area. I wonder if that's because of the ""contaminated"" scare that went around when people first started noticing the brown sugar crystals scattered through the mix and assumed that the evenly distributed, dissolves-in-water, brown crystals were a contaminate of some kind. Honestly, it seems that everything has to be bleached white as a ghost these days, ruining all the flavor and nutrients, and introducing goodness knows what chemicals into your system before people will eat it. And now even Amazon doesn't seem to carry it, which breaks my heart. Fortunately, we were able to find it on Shop Food Ex dot com, and everything arrived with another year-and-several-months to go on the expiration dates, so we're all stocked up for the winter.<br /><br />Nutrition Information<br />---------------------<br />Serving Size: 1/3 cup of mix<br />Servings per Container: ~19<br />Calories per Serving: 170<br />Calories from Fat: 20<br />Total Fat: 2g<br />Saturated Fat: 0.5g<br />Trans Fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 5mg<br />Sodium: 450mg<br />Total Carbohydrate: 34g<br />Dietary Fiber: 1g<br />Sugars: 6g<br />Protein: 5g<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll"
1,I could not find this product on any store shelf.  Amazon came through.  Makes the best WS's.
1,"Whiskey Sour Mix is excellent.  Much better than in the liquor stores.  Daiquiri mix (almost a duplicate recipe to thw W. S. Mix except with Rum instead of Bourbon, is not so good. With some lime sherbet, it would be Methodist Punch (which is ok, but not what we are looking for).  The Marguarita mix I have not tried, but really.. .  Marguaritas should not involve any kind of mix."
1,I have been serving these at my parties for a couple weeks now and EVERYBODY loves them. I will re-order soon!!
1,Didn't think I'd ever find anything as good as my Holland House dry sour mix packets.  This is equally as good.  I'll stock up for our bar now that I've tried it.
1,"I have tried several liquid sour mixes and I'm usually very disappointed. Either they taste too sweet or too fake. This product has no artificial colors and it definitely makes a difference. This mix makes a delicious whiskey sour.  I ordered the small box to try it, but I will be ordering again in a larger quantity to have on hand for parties."
0,The cost of the mix to the number of drinks you get is much to high.
1,"This grape jam is delicious.  It's smooth and sweet, but not overly sweet.  It spreads wonderfully and the taste is perfect.  For those of you who may get confused, this is jam, there are no seeds, just a smooth version of jelly.  I prefer this over jelly since jelly is kinda lumpy and does not spread as evenly."
1,I am happy that i bought the set rather than Individual items. Great deal guys. Cant wait for the great specials!!!
1,"Welch's Grape Jam is close to my Granny's homemade jam and brings back SOME fond childhood memories. Picking the grapes from my Great Aunt's arbor was just the beginning of the labor of love, to clean, prepare and cook them for making preserves, jam and jelly. Cleaning and sterilizing the jars wasn't fun either :(<br /><br />So yummy fond memories in a squeezable bottle makes this jam experience absolutely spreadable and wonderful!"
1,"This is a nice jelly that spreads fairly easily and the bottle makes it easy to apply to your sandwich or whatever else you want jelly for. It has a really nice grape-y flavor, so if you really like grape jelly, give this a try."
0,"I was disappointed in this product especially considering how exceptional the Salmon Oil they make is.<br /><br />This did not pass the 11 rescue dog test! They just turned up their noses. So did the other dogs here. Very tiny tidbits, as well.Buy an extra bottle of the Grizzly Salmon oil instead."
1,"I tried these "" Nu Treats"" because they were offered at a discount when I purchased some Grizzly Salmon Oil for my dog.  When I read the list of ingedients on the package for the treats, I was stoked.  These crunchy little morsels are packed with nutrients and small enough to use for training without having to break them.<br /><br />The only downside is the smell... but they *are smoked salmon treats after all.  An added bonus is that they seem to digest well (unlike cheese and some other lamb-based treats I've tried)."
1,"Our 8 year old Cairn terrier suffers from food allergies and she can enjoy these with no side effects at all.  They also come in a convenient size for smaller dogs, which I appreciate."
1,"We originally tried these treats when we received as a sample. My dog loved them, and i thought the smell was so fishy, no wonder he did!<br />The bag will last a long time. Do not feed too many, as it states on the package. It is a good value. Could even be cut in half or smaller to use as training rewards."
1,"My dog can't get enough of these things. He gets so excited anytime he even hears the bag crinkle. We were told at obedience class to bring treats our dogs will do anything for and this was my choice. I'm back ordering more. With two labs, I wish I could order in bulk."
1,"Our GSD loves the treats.  They have never upset her stomach at all and she takes them down with no problems whatsoever.<br /><br />It's quite true that they smell like fish food, but I normally don't carry them around in my pocket on account of them being pretty brittle if you were to have them bounce around in a pocket or treat bag.<br /><br />The fact that they are loved by our dog and are a healthy snack makes it a win-win for us.  I'd definitely purchase these in the future."
1,"These are extremely popular with the canines I've offered them to - a nice small size and, being grain-free, a very healthy treat as well. My only objection is that they're kinda smelly to carry around in your pockets, as I usually do, altho the dogs consider the scent a very tantalizing aroma!"
0,"These are excellent treats, my dog really likes them, but from this seller specifically, they arrived almost completely pulverized so it was mostly a bag of salmon dust.  I used them to supplement the dog food, but they were mostly useless as treats."
1,"I've been giving these to my 2 little dogs for over 5 yrs.  They love them and I love giving them to my girls.<br />They are a nutritious salmon protein treat with essential amino acids and calcium. They're low calorie<br />with no artificial anything.<br />And... they're made from Alaskan Wild Salmon in the Pacific Northwest -- not salmon from the polluted<br />waters of the east coast. We use them for training treats, just because treats and in their puzzle toys.<br />They never lose their interest when rewarded with these treats. I highly recommend."
1,My dog LOVES these treats! The ingredients are so good for her and they don't cause any allergies or reactions either. Great product!
1,"It's funny that most of the other reviews talk about using it straight, when I've never used it that way or even thought to try using it as shoyu! I use it as a soup base for zaru soba, somen salad, and udon. We mostly use it for hot udon. You basically put different amounts of water for whatever noodle you're eating and it tastes amazing each time. For instance, udon uses 1 part memmi, 12 parts water. It's extremely simple and tastes soooo good. Me and my daughter always drink the soup after and I make extra now so that we can have a lot of soup to drink with each noodle! This is really an amazingly good sauce! I'm hoping they eventually add subscribe and save for it."
1,"I'm a big soy sauce fan but after tasting Memmi Noodle Soup Base, I don't think I can ever go back. It tastes much less salty and has a lot more sweetness (without being overly sweet) than regular soy sauce. I should probably actually try it as a soup base sometime, haha, but it's great over veggies and rice!"
1,"My mother-in-law introduced me to this sauce years ago and I have loved it ever since. Me and my kids cant live without it! Try it with a little rice vinegar added and it is a great dipping sauce for egg rolls, california rolls and gyozas. I would have given this 5 starts but find that it is a little on the pricey side here. I can buy a big bottle of this at my local asian market for about $3 a bottle."
1,"We go through 3 bottles of this every 6-7 months.  We buy Annie Chun's soba noodles from amazon, cook those and flush with cold water, drain and in a bowl with this sauce, some water, sliced or shredded cucumber, carrot, chili, etc.  Get the salad shooter out ;)<br /><br />Very refreshing on a hot summer stretch, you can actually cook the noodles in advance and store in a ziploc in the fridge with your vegetables, then make this delicious cold dish in a flash.  Since the noodles cook in just a few minutes, dinner can be done in 5.<br /><br />This sauce is somewhat like a teriyaki sauce, and its very popular with my son and his friends.  Soy sauce, sugar and seasonings.<br /><br />Besides our favorite cold noodle dish, you can also make hot and cold soups.  With a little prepared dashi (dried bonito flake) broth mixed in, you can bring together a tasty hot or cold soup quickly.<br /><br />Best of all, you can buy all of this from amazon at the same time.  Our supermarkets are spotty with selling soba noodles, none of them carry this memmi sauce, and instant dashi can be challenging to find."
1,"We have a restaurant here in town that has a fusion of Asian cuisines...and they have this absolutely delicious Taiwanese Beef noodle soup...for $10 a bowl. I rarely have it because it's expensive for a soup! Still...I crave that flavor. Hard to describe. So...did a little digging around on the internet and found this. We made it tonight for the first time using about a 6 parts water to one part soup base and adding garlic, crushed chili flakes, Chinese five spice and some mushrooms...then served over linguini in a soup bowl. Soooo good. It's clear, dark, somewhat sweet but yet salty and has that mushroomy-umame taste that just makes you addicted to it!! Next time, we are adding some shrimp or beef and topping with sliced green onions/scallions."
1,"Although it says ""Soup Base"" on the bottle, my family hardly uses it for that purpose. It works great for everyday cooking and I would describe it as a sweet soy sauce. Try it on any type of meat and cooked vegetables. You can get a 20oz bottle for ~3-4$ at an Asian market."
1,"This is a wonderful addition to soup stocks or packaged ramen in place of the ""flavor packet"". I use it often and enjoy the unique flavor it adds to chicken stock or water. Well worth experimenting with."
1,"This is a lollipop that has flavor (orange) throughout and quite yummy!  It tastes different, less artificial, than other lollipops and that is what made us order more than once!<br /><br />High school colors are orange and black so used this first for graduation party (having the lollipops fanned out) and then just for special occasion (birthday) or celebrations (sports banquets, etc.).<br /><br />Loss of one star: Part of the lollipop goes over the top of the stick and that is the easiest part to eat, the rest is swirled around a stick that is a small diameter dowel stick. It was a bit of a drawback that part was swirled around this hard stick and you had to try and lick it off or bite it off--you end up leaving little pieces of it on the stick. Would have loved to have had a softer stick that had a bit of give to it or even had a round lollipop that had the majority of it off of the stick. The stick part probably means that this is not for preschoolers.<br /><br />But yummy flavor and thinking of ordering more!"
1,This product is a good one and enhance the taste of the food or chicken. It also makes easy preparation with instruction on how to cook or mix all the ingredients.
1,"My lab mix has a very sensitive tummy. He had recurrent bouts of diarrhea, vomiting and constant wretched gas. I had given him pedigree for awhile but realized that was no good for him. Then we tried science diet, but his gas seemed to get worse and his tummy would gurgle all day.<br /><br />I read about this dog food and its natural ingredients. There's no corn meal or other fillers. He's been on this food for about 2 weeks now and his gas has disappeared! He has not had a single bout of diarrhea or vomiting. I'm impressed. Yes it's pricey and I normally wouldn't buy something so expensive, but it is well worth it for the health of my dog.<br /><br />*Updated* to say that he has been on this food for a few months now and has continued to be free of tummy troubles and wretched gas. He hasn't vomited at all or had diarrhea. His coat has gotten so much shinier and he seems to be a much happier dog without all the tummy issues!"
1,"We finally found this food, just by luck at the pet store.  Our dog (boxer/bulldog mix), now 6, had suffered mysterious allergies from the time he was 2 until I found this food.  We went to a Veterinary Allergy Specialist for over a year, spent thousands of dollars, went to extremes trying prednisone (which the side-effects are very problematic) & antibiotics, and tried over 6 different prescription pet foods; nothing helped.  Our dogs paws/feet would blister up in between his toes, burst, and bleed.  We even had our dog run grassed with synthetic/artificial turf in case it was due to grass allergy.<br /><br />The food is a little pricey, he eats 6 cups of food a day, but I cannot express the relief we have had from finding a food that eliminates his allergy symptoms.  I have to admit that the smell of the fish is a little overwhelming.  We had had to resort to feeding him outside now, which wouldn't be so bad, except the birds seem to like it too."
1,"I love this food. It actually is the only food I have found that my dog is not allergic to. (except for an extremely expensive prescription diet) I have a boxer on this food. He is allergic to almost everything. However, he is not allergic to salmon or sweet potatoes making this food the perfect choice for him. All food related allergies have disappeared and his coat has improved tremendously. He still deals with outdoor allergies, but this food has shown a big improvement in him. The only issue I have had is that he packed on a few extra pounds, which he has now lost. I cut down his dry food amount and mix canned green beans and carrots in with the dry food so he has enough to eat without the extra weight. He loves it and eats every bite!"
1,"I have 2 schanuzers, one has great skin one has serious skin allergies. When we adopted them they were eating kibbles and bits, and the one with bad skin looked horrible. I hate to say it, but I didn't even like petting him.<br /><br />We went to the vet and spoke to a nutirentest, they gave us some small samples for each dog to try and find out which brand of dog food they liked the best. Turns out they both loved the natures balance.<br /><br />I chose the fish and sweet potato flavor since most dogs that have alleriges are also allergic to chicken and rice. We have been using this dog food for almost 3 months and I have seen a dramtic change in both of their coats!<br /><br />The one with great skin, is even softer and shiner. But the one with bad skin has had the most change. He has a beasutiful shiney dark black coat. He has completly stopped itching and all the bumps are gone.<br /><br />I cannot say enough good things about this food!"
1,Natural Balance Sweet Potatoe and Fish is awesome.  Since eating this my cocker spaniel has not had anymore ear infections!!  He loves the food and it has benefited him greatly.  Would recommend this dog food!!
1,The only brand that wont give my doggies the itch and allergies! Been loyal to the brand for 4 years now...
1,"My Golden is my heart.  And she has allergies, and with a Golden ear infections are very possible.  Switching to a limited ingredient dog food has been a huge positive.  And, she loves this stuff.  Give the option of a few dog foods, she'll go to this one and bark for it.  Her weight has remained consistent since the switch, btw.  I do recommend it.  For those on a budget, I would add: this flavor (as opposed to their Venison and/or Bison flavors) tends to be about five dollars cheaper; stalking the items price fluctuations tends to save another five.  This size bag is about a six week supply for us, I think.  The plus side to ordering is that you can get the bigger bag, and someone else carries it to your door.  However, if you have a local business in your area that stocks this (I don't, but my Mom does) they will probably load it for you.  And the local Natural Dog Food store actually gives samples.  Anywhoo, wherever you buy, I think this is a product worth trying."
0,"Be cautious about all store dog foods. My dog had been eating Natural Balance Sweet Potato and Fish and developed digestive issues and almost died.  I thought it was a number of things. Had lots of tests run and then one of my clients dogs developed the same issues with his dog on the same dog food and has also spent a lot of money trying to correct the gut issue. Can't prove anything as we got rid of the dog food, but since they recalled their Sweet Potato and Chicken this year because of (see below)...Posted: Jun 21, 2010 at 4:00 PM [Jun 21, 2010]<br /><br />In 2007, a pet food recall was issued after the FDA discovered that vegetable proteins imported from China that were used to produce pet foods were contaminated with melamine.

1,"Over the summer my girlfriend and I adopted an American Bulldog who, unbeknownst to us had a number of allergies.  In the beginning these allergies manifested themselves through excessive scratching and some overwhelming stomach related ailments, which, for the benefit of the reader, I'll only describe as the type of thing which made us wonder if our dog's insides had been possessed or become otherwise engaged in some advanced stage of decay.  As cute as he is, he'd come into a room, gun-hot so to speak, and very quickly force us to find another place to sit.<br /><br />This food changed all of that.<br /><br />After trying him on two or three other products this food caused him to all but stop scratching and, for all intents and purposes, put an end to that earth-shattering, life-changing, climate-altering flatulence (there, I finally said it) of his.  He's now the perfect dog, this food has improved his life, our lives, and the lives of anyone who comes to visit.  It's definitely worth it."
1,"I have a Jack Russell Terrier. It has an allergic reaction to chicken and some grains.  This food seems to have solved most if not all of its allergy problems.  The dog had chewed itself raw.  After a couple of weeks of this dog food, hair was growing back with only occasional scratching.  Nothing like it use to be.  I gave it 5 stars because it worked.  Would my dog rather have burger or steak... yes.  But, it does eat this.  I order a bag a week and a half before I run out.  Not as cheap as regular dog food, but saves on the Vet bills.  Fifty dollars a bag for the dog food, versus a minimum, $150 for a visit to the Vet."
0,My dog has an over abundance of ear wax and the vet suggested I try this food. My dog has been eating this exclusively for 10 days and it has made him sick. He has tons of gas and diarrhea. The only thing positive that I can say is that he liked the taste.
0,"I was very happy with this product at first, as it solved my little dog's skin problems. Now, almost 2 years later, my dog has developed really bad cough allergy. I have solidly confirmed the food is the root cause by stopping & trying it again. I just want to mention that this is a 2nd time we have to discontinue dog food after years of use, due to newly developed allergies."
1,"Great dog food.  My 2.5 year old lab is at a healthier weight after a year on this (she was 90 lbs as a 1.5 year old pup, and she's slimmed down to 80.  But she's a very large lab, so she wasn't really fat to begin with).  Also, I don't wanna get too graphic, but there is evidence on our walks that she's digesting this better than the grocery store food I used to give her.<br /><br />(I started her on this because we suspected a food allergy, and then I liked the results.)<br /><br />But why is it going up in price?  I've been buying it off Amazon because, with Prime, it's cost effective.  But it was $50 in February, $55 in March, and now $60 in April?  What gives??  I might have to start buying it at the brick-and-mortar store again.  And that's a shame, because having a month's worth of dog food delivered to your door is pretty awesome."
1,"My french bulldog developed SEVERE allergies at around 8 months.  Within a few weeks he was covered in bumps from head-to-toe, his hair fell out, he wheezed horribly, had really bad gas, went to the bathroom a lot and had loose stools.  I wasn't sure he would live, and the Vet said he had severe allergies, probably to his food, and put him on several months of prednisone and a prescription allergy food.  I was upset with the prednisone treatment as I knew it was dangerous and my dog hated the prescription food.  Two weeks later there was almost no change and he was still miserable, so I started researching my own solution for allergies, comparing food ingredients, and ideas to try.  I found that salmon/fish and sweet potatoes are not ingredients found in many other dog foods so an allergy to them would be more rare...and this food doesn't contain any grains or poultry products.  I started him on this and added a heaping spoon of canned pink salmon with it, and he still licks the bowl clean every time.  His breathing started clearing up within a week or so and I was able to stop giving him prednisone.  The bumps gradually went away after about a month and a half and his hair slowly grew back.  It took about 4+ months for 100% of his symptoms to go away, but he has been doing great for over a year now.  (For treats he is only allowed raw baby carrots, apple chunks, frozen green beans, or salmon jerky.)<br /><br />This food is an excellent option for dogs with both grain and poultry allergies as I can't seem to find another quality dog food that doesn't contain a little bit of chicken or rice, eggs, oatmeal, etc.  My only issue is that it is a bit low on protein, but since I add canned salmon to his food each day anyway isn't a problem for us.  The canned salmon and salmon oil are good for his skin so it works nicely, especially since he will eat the dry dog food just fine, but when I add the canned salmon he goes nuts for it.<br /><br />If your dog has allergies, try this!!  Don't let the vet sell you prescription dog food and put your dog on dangerous doses of prednisone.  My vet put my dog on the most common one sold; it was really expensive and I was so upset after I researched it and discovered that it has almost zero nutritional value.  (Look at petfoodanalysis. com as it does an amazing job of reviewing all foods and ranking them on quality ingredients, etc.)"
1,"My shelter dog, Sarah, is a long-haired shepherd-chow chow mix that is allergic to so many food ingredients and outdoor plants, that I just say ""She is allergic to nature!""<br /><br />She was scratching almost non-stop, which was unpleasant and uncomfortable for her, and frustrating and distracting for me, so I decided to take her to a highly recommended veterinarian to perform allergy tests to see what was causing the problem.<br /><br />As it turned out, almost every food ingredient and outdoor plant (wild and cultured) was checked off the list as her being allergic to them.<br /><br />""What to do?"" I asked.  ""She's got to eat something, and she's got to go outdoors.""<br /><br />The veterinarian gave me a bag of this Natural Balance Fish and Sweet Potato dry dog food.  What a difference it made!  The scratching was reduced 90 percent and both Sarah and I felt much better for it.<br /><br />Highly recommended for any dog suffering from allergies."
0,"I have been a faithful buyer of Natural Balance for years for my large dog with allergies.  Thinking I was getting the best.<br /><br />My dog developed a yeast infection that my vet told me was allergies.  He has constant ear infections, itching and he started to lose weight. His skin was like an elephant and it started to flake off.  Turns out the potatoes and sweet potatoes in the Potato and Venison dog foods was feeding the yeast infection and it was killing him.  He was losing weight and went from 75 pounds to 57 pounds before we found out the cause. I contacted the food company who were no help at all.  They didn't even respond to my reply.  I wasn't asking for any miracles, I just wanted some answers and I got a big fat NOTHING.<br /><br />After switching vets my new vet discovered the yeast infection and we switched the dog food.  He started to gain weight but we have a long road ahead of us to keep the yeast at bay.<br /><br />I am just disappointed in the company's customer service. I spent about $50 on a bag of food every two weeks plus treats.  My money will be better spent elsewhere."
1,"My ten month old doxie/mix started having horrible stomach problems.  She would regurgitate her food within minutes after eating it.  After spending $1000 at the vet and having no reason for why she was getting sick, I decided to look into a different kind of food.  She was on Wellness before and the vet switched her to a special canned food.  Then he had me switch her to Science Diet Sensitive Stomach.  She did fine on the canned food, but got sick with the Science Diet.  Once I started this food, she stopped getting sick.  It was a miracle!  Her gas has gone away and she has kept the food down for over two months.  I'm so happy with this food!  I switched her brother onto the food too, and they both love it."
1,"This product is great if you have a dog with allergies.  You know how awful it is when your ""baby"" is miserable.  Our pet's skin was so sensitive and itchy that he could barely be touched without trembling all over.  His skin became raw with open sores from his constant biting and scratching . At his worst, he began losing large sections of hair.  He also suffered from chronic ear infections.  We were back and forth to the vet every few weeks for steroids, antibiotics, etc.  We finally determined he had many food allergies. (beef, dairy, lamb, liver, chicken, kangaroo(??-they tested for this-not sure why) really all proteins except for fish.)  If you have a pet with allergies like this you know how hard it is to find products they are able to eat.  Meat/chicken by products seem to find there way into everything.  The Natural Balance Limited Ingredient Fish and Sweet Potato dog food is great.  Our dog loves the taste and the difference it has made in his skin in amazing.  His skin is completely healed, most of his hair has grown back and his ears are doing better as well.<br />I know this food is more expensive than many brands you find at the grocery store.  At first, my accountant husband was not thrilled  with the cost.  However, when he saw the tremendous improvement in ""Kelso's"" skin and saw the vet bills going away he realized what a value it really is.<br />AMAZING PRODUCT-AMAZING RESULTS-HAPPY/HEALTHY DOG!!"
0,"Natural Balance dog food is great, but the dog food I purchased from Amazon was not completely satisfactory.  There was about a 4 pound clump of dog food that was so hard and compressed, it would have been unreasonable to break apart or use.  a 5 pound bag of this dog food goes for $13, so  I feel like I lost money on this purchase for the convenience of having it delivered instead of an in-store pickup.  I won't be purchasing dog food from Amazon again.  I don't feel as if they rotate the food out as well as it would if one were to purchase it from Petco or PetSmart."
1,"The breeder we got our Goldendoodle from uses this dog food because it's great for doodles that may have sensitive stomachs, which ours does. He is now a 1year  and we continue to use this dog food, plus you get such a great deal for this bag on Amazon."
1,"We talked to the folks at petco and their dog also had cushings.  They said their dog responded well to the diet change so not having much to do on the vet's end we gave it a try.  Our dog did not like the taste at first, but began to prefer this over her old food (natural choice for sensitive stomachs which she had been on for years).  It is expensive, which hurts the wallet, but it has been worth it to see the improvement and to see her playing and more active again."
1,"This product arrived on time and it was in perfect condition. My dog loves this food, she has a really sensitive tummy and this does not bother her at all.  I would buy this product again and I would order from this seller as well."
0,"I ordered the natural balance salmon dry dog food because I had good luck with the natural balance salmon dry cat food.  Further, I am a pescatarian and was disappointed to see how almost every dry dog and cat food brand at the grocery stores and on the market contain chicken, lamb, or beef bi -products.  I love my dogs, but I cannot see feeding baby lamb to my dog! Even the ""only fish"" labelled dog and cat foods on the market often contain chicken, etc when you look on the ingredients list.  So I was very pleased to find a cost effective solution to this in natural balance.  The only issue is that my dogs will not touch this food! They would rather starve than eat it it seems, perhaps because it is the diet formula?  I'm not sure.  However, I will say that they all (including the cat) flock to the Natural Balance salmon dry cat food lol so I will continue ordering that for the cat."
1,"I have had problems finding a dog food that my sensitive dog could eat, and my other dog would like also! They both seem to agree that the duck and fish flavor is the best! They  chow it down like there isnt going to be an another meal:) Shipping was really fast:)"
1,"My pure bread yellow lab is surprisingly a very picky eater and after going through several other brands this is the only food he will eat.  He doesn't have allergies that we're aware of and hasn't had any bad reactions to other foods, he just won't eat them.  Now I've moved to an area where I can't get this food at a nearby store, so I've come to Amazon.com to start ordering it regularly for delivery."
1,"My english bulldog had severe food allergies.  It would make him lick his paws until they were red, paw at his face, itch, and worst of all have very frequent messy poops!<br />I tried many remedies and foods until I tried Natural Balance.  This formula has helped all the problems he had with food allergy.  And, he has hardly any smelly gas anymore!"
0,"This product made my dog very sick. He is an older 11 year old pug with allergies and this particular mix is supposed to be good with allergies. I decided to try it because my vet had run out of Science Diet Salmon and Sweet Potato and I found this very reputable looking dog food with free shipping on Amazon Prime.<br /><br />Within 3 days off feeding it to my dog he seemed to loose all energy and my wife was concerned we wouldn't have him very much longer. I then Googled the brand and found a recall due to salmonella contamination! Granted, the recall wasn't on this specific mix, but when I tried to contact the company they haven't even bothered to respond within four days! I ran out and found another vet who carries science diet and within a day or two my dogs is energetic and back to his old self.  This dog food is supposed to be 100% guaranteed, just return the unused portion back to the retailer - yeah, shipping 28 lbs of dog food back to Amazon and finding the box it will fit in  is real convenient..."
1,"Used to buy this from Petco, easier and less expensive on line.  Last time they shipped me the wrong flavor (and cost themselves $20.00 in return shipping).  That's the only issue I've had.  The food itself is an excellent premium brand, dog loves it, coat looks great and it has never upset his stomach (used to feed ""chicken soup for the dog lover's soul and it did)"
1,"I have a 7 year old female Newfoundland who has had allergy problems for years.  I have tried all sorts of things except buying hypoallergenic dog food.  After reading review about this food, I thought I would give it a try.  She is getting around much better, has more energy, quit licking hair off feet, ears getting better, and her coat is getting more beautiful color back(bronze).  Financially it is not easy to buy this food! I have 6 dogs total, a few I found and took in, not that we can afford to.  In this difficult economy people are just dropping their dogs off and the shelters are full.  I would love to have all my dogs on a good food like Natural Balance but can not afford it.  So, my Newfoundland will be the only one on it because of her problems."
0,"My dog was eating this food and has had bad gas, bloody and loose stools.  We have stopped giving this to him but we are still trying to get his tummy troubles under control.  All blood tests, stool tests, and urine tests have come back OK."
1,This was purchased as a gift. I think they are enjoying it. I like the Barnie's regular Santa's White Christmas for me.
0,"I don't know what happened to my favorite coffee, santa white christmas coffee, but barnies really turned this coffee into tasteless coffee I will never buy again... what a shame"
1,"Amazon is the best site ever--so quick and easy--And I was soooo happy to find Barnie's coffee!!  My husband and I both drink decaf so it was a delight to find Santa's White Christmas.  We have had this coffee many times before--sooooo delicious!!!  Barnies' service was amazingly quick, but I will save the coffee until Thanksgiving Day--that day will start my Christmas season of enjoying that delicous coconutty flavor for the full month of December.  Thanks, y'all!!!!!!"
1,I ordered this coffee for my mom since she has to drink decaf and she absolutely loves it.  I've also tried it and am really impressed.  The flavor is wonderfully smooth and it also smells amazing.  I would highly recommend this decaf coffee to anyone.  The price is reasonable too!
1,I have loved this coffee for over 12 years.  So glad to find it online.  Not in stores in Maryland.
1,"this is a lightweight gaiter that is easy-on and easy off.the only improvement that i can imagine would be the zipper,which is a little hard to engage."
0,"TLDR version:  Look elsewhere if you want great decaf beans.  These weren't even worth the price at 57% off list.<br /><br />Normal version:<br /><br />I purchased these when there was a deal a few weeks ago, and have been brewing both espresso and drip coffee with them and a caffeinated variety by the same company.  This review is for the Larry's Beans Fair Trade Organic Decaf Espresso.<br /><br />The first thing to say about Larry's Beans is that they are all packaged quite well in individual boxes which contain the air-tight bag of beans.  This makes them easy to stack in a warehouse, and also prevents warehouse employees from inadvertently slicing open the bag when unloading a crate or larger package.<br /><br />When I received the beans, I immediately fished out some freezer bags and prepared to portion out the beans.  I opened the sealed bag and the beans smelled OK; the smell wasn't overpowering but it was not what I would consider ""gourmet.""  It's not old or musty smelling like some of the other ""gourmet"" decaf bean roasters represented here on Amazon, but it's also not top shelf.<br /><br />Although the beans are evenly roasted, I would definitely not call it Espresso roast.  The roast is more reminiscent of a mild breakfast roast - medium brown, not the dark black I expect when I think of espresso.  Also, the beans are very small - clearly not a premium batch of beans.  I expect a ""gourmet"" bean to accurately represent the style of roast, and for the beans to be large, although uniform in size.  Neither were the case with these beans.<br /><br />When portioning the beans into 1lb freezer bags, I found that the beans really aren't oily at all.  I surmise that this has to be due to the water process used to decaffeinate the beans, although I don't know this to be a fact.  I expect a ""gourmet"" bean to be oily enough to leave a clear film on the inside of the freezer bags I package them in, and this didn't accomplish that feat.<br /><br />As you can see, the initial impressions of the look and smell of the beans were only mediocre, not outstanding like the price should suggest.  Now, on to the flavor.<br /><br />Fresh out of the 5lb bag, I hand-ground enough of the beans for a couple of shots of espresso.  Yes, I have a counter-mounted hand grinder that can also be used to make flour from grains!  Anyway, I ran the ground coffee through my pump espresso maker, and what came out the other side had no crema, although the shots themselves didn't taste horrible.  The flavor was reminiscent of unsweetened cocoa, with astringent, grapeskin-like qualities that struck me as quite bitter for the mild roast.<br /><br />I have since made pots of drip decaf with this bean, and combined it with a caffeinated version from Larry's Beans, and it's passable (carried by the excellent quality of the caffeinated beans, I'm sure), although still not what I would consider worth the price.  I haven't found any excellent decaf beans on Amazon, yet, so I will move on to another variety once this batch is gone."
1,"I find Larry's decaf espresso as good or better than anything I can find in a coffee house.  Espresso quality is quite variable when it comes to decaf.  I've ordered these beans 5-6 times and never been disappointed.  I grind the beans very fine in a small counter grinder, about 2 cups at a time.  I keep coming back for more and I've always found them available on Amazon."
0,I have bough Larry's coffee in the past and it was ok. This last batch was awful! The beans were not fresh and it taste only slightly better than Maxwell house! do yourself a favor and get coffee from coffee bean direct on amazon. WAY better coffee at a way better price
1,"quick:<br />- good crema<br />- good taste<br />- water processed decaf<br /><br />detailed:<br />The decaf espresso's at Amazon seem to come and go.  Everytime I try to reorder one they don't seem to carry it anymore.  That being said, I've tried a lot of decaf espressos.  Larry's has a great taste and uses a water process for deaffeination (which I prefer over the other chemical processes).  Why decaf?  Well I drink a few quad lattes a day (love the taste) and the caffeine starts getting to me.  I mix regular espresso beans with decaf espresso beans to create a half and half mixture.  I have also found the Larry's regular espresso to be a good tasting product."
1,"The SHU strength of this cayenne is listed as being about one-third less than  the capsules I was using (90,000)but it tastes just as HOT! You can tell it is also very fresh.<br /><br />Some advice: Try to use whatever amount you take either sprinkled on food or, like I do, about an eight to one-quarter teaspoon mixed with about 8 oz of liquid. If you take the capsule form straight (which you can open up), it will shock your system when it explodes in your stomach, possibly doing harm."
1,"This product arrived promptly and was packaged efficiently & cleanly. The pepper was ground very consistently to a smooth fine texture. We make capsules from our pepper so the nice texture is a plus. The color was a nice bright orange (old product tends to be brown). I agree that capsules can be a little stressful, if you take too many, so start with one & add another when your system is adjusted to it. I always eat a little food before & after the capsules & have very little discomfort (Actually almost never). I recommend that you do your research online to learn the best way for you to use cayenne.  We have experienced several obvious benefits."
1,My hot-loving tastebuds are thrilled and nice to know it is not irradiated. Love to sprinkle on 90% cocoa bars for some sweet heat!
1,"High Quality Cayenne Pepper!!! Da best! Love, Love, Love it!!! Works for my heart condition, and also cures colds!! Awesome Brand!!"
1,"I Bought this product because it is organic & for the price it is a very good deal at $10.17 per pound. When you open the package it smells very fresh with an orange colour, & it is very hot. Be sure to share with a friend because one pound is about eight 2oz bottles you buy at a grocery store."
1,". I really like this product<br />and also the concept of powdered vegetables;<br />but in the case of peppers,<br />they have a lot of vitamin C,<br />and if that gets oxidized,<br /> it can cause stomach cancer;<br />so it would be nice to see<br />the vitamin C content on this package<br />to know how much did not get oxidized .<br />. next time you get a jar of pasta sauce,<br />notice that high-fat versions are bright orange<br />and they have servings with 25% RDA of vitamin C;<br />whereas, low fat versions look dark,<br />and they have servings with 10% RDA of vitamin C<br />-- the difference is in the oxidation:<br />oxidized vitamin C is not counted .<br />. not a big deal though, because;<br />this product is very hot,<br />so I don't use much of it!"
1,"The seller is really nice.<br />The paste teases good.<br />I am a Chinese and I love Korean food.<br />It's nice to make pibim pap(dont know how to type it in English) ''' 'noodles.<br />I also used it in kimchi.<br />It's not very hot, also has a little bit sweet flavor.<br />Worth it to have a try!"
1,"I was worried about Arsenic, which quite often pollutes Rice Bran, especially for brans coming from China. So I called Bobs Red Mill customer service to ask if there was any control on the level of Arsenic in the bran. They told me it comes from California and there is no risk of it being contaminated with Arsenic. I hope thats the truth...<br />Its too bad that they dont offer an organic one.  I searched everywhere and it seems an organic rice bran is nowhere to be found.<br />Anyway this is really fresh, tastes fantastic, great smooth texture, you can use it in sooo many ways, and it's ready to eat, no need of cooking it."
1,"I use rice bran in place of flour--has the texture of flour, very high in fiber, no gluten, and great taste--"
1,This product adds nice flavor and fiber to home baked breads.  Just substitute 1/4 cup Rice Bran for up to 1/4 cup of the total Gluten Free blend of choice in your recipe.
1,"Ah, so many great uses for this great product. The texture and fine and smooth, very even, just like flour, but also very dry because the oil has been removed. If you want rice bran without the oil removed, don't buy packages labeled ""stabilized.""<br /><br />First of all, I use this to make an exfoliating face mask/scrub by making a paste using this mixed with a little bit of green tea, olive oil (or whatever carrier oil you like), and milk. I smooth a layer over my face, wait for it to dry, then jump in the shower, dampen it, and rub for about a minute before rinsing it off. The tiny grains exfoliate without being rough on the skin and it smells sooo good! (like rice :) My skin is much tighter and brighter afterwards and I put the leftovers in the fridge for another day. Plus, this is way cheaper than buying those rice bran face masks from Japan.<br /><br />I also use this as a partial substitute for flour in baking. It's very nutritious and causes my cookies to spread out a little flatter (maybe because it reacts differently to the baking soda?), but the taste of the cookies is not affected and I like crispy edged cookies.<br /><br />I also sprinkle this on white rice since this is the vitamin-packed part of the rice before the rice is processed. I sprinkle it in other dishes too, especially ones that require a little thickening. Overall this is a great product and I'd buy it again!"
1,"Anyways, I use this in raw porridge recipe, it is very nutritious and moves your bowels too (excuse me). It has vitamins, and lots of fiber to control the blood sugar concurring with the other reviews.<br /><br />It best eaten raw, so all the nutrients are intact. I recommended with other raw seeds, and wheat bran, raisins, and milk."
1,"Great product, fast and FREE shipping, and a great price!!! This product is probably the most nutrient dense food on the entire planet. The benefits to all the sub-systems in the human body are endless. Do a web search on ""Stabilized Rice Bran"" to get all the nutritional benefits/details. Also, it's the ONLY natural source for GAMMA-ORYZANOL, a highly potent anti-oxidant."
1,It is delicious even raw! I love this stuff. I like quite a few of Bob's Red Mill products.
1,"I purchased this product for it's high fiber content.  I use it in everything from pancakes to oatmeal to cookies to milkshakes to gravy and it's GREAT! You barely taste it, but are still able to enjoy all of the awesome nutritional benefits.  GREAT product!!!!!! I will definitely purchase it again."
1,"This rice bran is the absolute best tasting of all the brands that I have tried.  Some of the others have a bitter taste. This has a sweet taste which results in me being able to reduce the sugar in the recipes. I use it to add fiber to cake recipes with brown rice flour, as I am allergic to wheat.  I recommend this product over all other brands & give it the maximum number of stars.  It can also be ordered directly from the manufacturer.  For the best price, be sure to compare shipping rates."
1,I am enjoying many benefits from this grain. The fact that it's a stabilized bran results in more nutrients being available after the processing and presumably a longer shelf life as well. I am using it daily as a supplement to treat a chronic condition with success to date. The antioxidents in rice bran can only help immunity and general health. I recommend adding it to your diet.
1,Rice bran is a healthy way for those on a gluten free diet to get fiber.
1,"Helps my dog, who has a sensitive stomach -firms up her stools and adds nutrition at the same time. I add 1/4 tsp. to each feeding for my 25 pound dog."
1,I make quite a bit of bread in my bread machine.  Several of my recipes call for rice bran but I was unable to find it in my local grocery stores.  I was pleased to find it on Amazon at such a great price!  I froze the other 3 bags and have good luck in the past freezing flours.  The bread I made with this bran was fabulous!!
1,It's very difficult getting enough of the B vitamins from the standard American diet so I supplement my diet using brewers yeast or rice bran.  Bob's Red Mill is known for high quality health foods and the price was very good. Try a little rice bran sprinkled on your breakfast cereal or lunch salad and you'll find you have real 5-hour energy.
1,I could not find Bob's red mill rice bran in any grocery stores.  I found it on Amazon.  It arrived at my house within a few days of ordering in great condition.
0,"You know how in China and Japan they mostly eat white rice but at the same time some really smart integrated health care professionals in America insist that brown rice would be healthier because it has more minerals, B vitamins and a lower glycemic index?<br /><br />Well, maybe that's a pile of noise.<br /><br />Maybe the people in Japan and China actually know what they're doing this time (just like pretty much every other time). Maybe the miniscule quantities of vitamins and minerals in brown rice are more than outweighed by allergens and other noxious things (like cyanide) in the bran, which help prevent baby rice grains in the wild from being devoured in the first place.<br /><br />On the other hand, I gotta say, it *does* taste good."
1,"I found the most enjoyable way to eat these is with Numi Winter Spice tea.  The flavors in the hot tea compliment the cookies perfectly!  No need to add sugar or milk to the tea.  The cookies make up for the lack of sweetener.  I love to dip these extra crunchy cookies into the hot tea & nibble at them.  It is a heavenly treat!<br /><br />The cookies are bite sized & they are hard.  The minute you open the bag your senses will be delighted by the aroma of chocolate & orange.  They do not taste bland or like ""cardboard"" as some cookies of this type can taste.  Overall they are a decent cookie.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that they are not 100% Organic.  This entire line of Family Recipe cookies is not 100% Organic.  Since I don't have a lot of organic options, I will settle on this brand.  It is nice to have these when I have too much work to do around the farm or it is simply too hot out to have the oven on to make my own cookies - which are the best since home made cookies can't be beat!<br /><br />I also tried their Family Recipe Ginger Snaps & they were very tasty as well with little bits of chewy ginger in them.  The Ginger Snaps are another cookie perfect with hot tea as they too are hard & small. I plan on trying the Chocolate Chocolate Chip next."
0,"I'm so sorry I bought this.  I've purchased this product in stores and it has been great; but what I purchased on line was old and rancid...I had to throw out $90 worth of junk.  I'm beyond disappointed, it smelled, and my dog wouldn't even eat it.  LLM"
0,I had bought similar treats for my dogs in the past and they loved them.  But these came individually wrapped in plastic which permeated the chew with a plastic smell (and I assume flavor).  My dogs won't touch them.  Don't waste your money.
0,"My brewer lasted for three uses. After three uses it no longer pumps any water. I called customer service, because I spent extra money on a commercial brewer, I can only get it fixed through a technician who has a prohibitive call queue.  I have called back a total a five times, and each time I am told that a technician will call me back. This has yet to happen over the last month that I have been trying to fix this. Had I bought a cheaper one from Walmart, this issue would have been resolved already. Do not buy this brewer. If it breaks, expect zero customer service from Keurig and to be out whatever money you have paid for it."
1,"I've had several Keurig brewers in the past and wore each of them out with heavy use. This one is the best one I've ever had! The coffee tastes better to me. I'm not sure why. It's a tiny bit bigger than the other models, but I think it's attractive.<br /><br />In the mornings my machine is a coffee brewer. Then I brew up some tea so I can pour it over ice and I drink iced tea all afternoon. In the evenings I might have hot tea or hot chocolate or more coffee. The best thing is the variety of flavors that are available. You never have to be bored having the same one. I usually start out with Tully's Breakfast blend or maybe their House blend, then after my taste buds wake up, I switch to Italian, which can't be beat! Then there is a Pomegrante tea that makes everything smell great. Sometimes I mix several flavors of tea together just for fun.<br /><br />This is the easiest and fastest way I've found to make coffee, tea, or hot chocolate. I love it!<br /><br />Edited to say that the coffee fills from the left side of the tray. I have put a tiny bowl to the right of where the cup goes so I don't put my cup in the wrong place. Several times I put the coffee cup too far to the right, only to come back a few minutes later and find that the coffee missed the cup."
1,"When I first tried Keurig it was a B150 at my new office and the B130 in our affiliates office. Both has a quick and easy way of making coffee while maintaining temperature with each cup. I had used these items for a few months, only to find myself wanting one. While I find the standard models repulsive, The B150 & B155 is a elegant machine that looks modern and has a touch screen to make a dull counter top exciting.<br /><br />You get a fresh tasty cup of coffee within 20 seconds and it is fast and easy to use. I use mine 3 times a day for coffee, hot apple cider (yum) and cocoa which all taste stellar.<br /><br />I do have to say you MUST order your K cups online to get the best deal, but Dunkin Donuts is probably the best coffee that tastes like it came from the store.<br /><br />A great investment and great coffee, you can't beat it!"
1,"This is a great item, easy to connect, and so easy to use.  This was an upgrade for us, and I don't regret it."
1,"I got hooked on K-cups at a customer's plant where I was working.  The coffee was so fresh and great tasting the I was compelled to buy this unit for my home.  It has not failed my expectations.  It has worked flawlessly since I first plugged it in.  The touch screen is a conversation piece when guests are in the kitchen because it rolls through various views of coffee beans, roasting, and the k-cup brewing cycle.  When you put a new k-cup into the holder it shows the screen to select your brew size, then all you have to do is select the size and hit the 'brew' button and you've got a superior cup of coffee.<br />Even the kids love brewing up a cup of hot cocoa.  And, if you don't like coffee or cocoa, try the chai latte (spiced black tea).  There are k-cups available that will please anyone."
0,"We bought two of these machines. The first one was put into action without running the flushing cycle, so understandably it gave off the plastic taste. But you would think that after a few months, the taste would go away.<br /><br />A few months later, the second unit was bought. This time we meticulously ran it through the flushing cycle. The plastic taste was minimized, but still there. Now after about one month of usage, the coffee it makes still tastes bad.<br /><br />We use the Green Mountain Keurig cups, so I doubt it's the coffee itself. For comparison, I went out and bought McDonald's black coffee (they use Newman's Own), and added sugar and creamer myself. The McDonald's coffee tasted much better, just pure and clean.<br /><br />For another reference point, we used to have a different model of Keurig, and that machine definitely made better coffee than this one. I wouldn't say it made great coffee, but it did not impart plastic taste.<br /><br />I have since resorted to buying my own coffee whenever possible, so it's difficult for me to give this more than one star."
1,"I purchased this for a small hair salon, It is quieter than my home brewer.<br />Have not had it long enough to test durability but the first thing I noticed was how heavy it was, seems like 30 pounds... Waiting (hoping) for my home unit to break so I can replace it with the B155"
1,"These are the best olives on the planet! Not just cerignolas,, but *these* cerignolas from The shipping makes them expensive so I try to limit myself to just 4-6 a day, but its hard. They are one of my all-time favorite snacks.<br />One word of warning - they are *extremely* salty in the full-strength brine they come in, so when I transfer them out of their bag into my own container I pour off about a third and just add plain filtered water. It just takes a few hours to pull enough out of the olives to make them heavenly. I don't discount the rating because of the salt though. I just figure it keeps them in such excellent condition on their journey to me."
1,Our dog loves this food! The bite size pieces are pretty small but that works out well for him because he doesn't really chew the food...he pretty much just swallows it whole. Great buy.
1,"I did not expect much when I got this food. 40 pounds for the price left me a reason to believe that something is wrong with the product. Well hey, I got this huge back, which was delivered right to my door, so I didn't have to move something heavy like this upstairs (sorry, delivery guy, I bet you cussed a couple of times using those stairs). I have two puppies - min pin and toy fox, and those little gluttons are chewing this food up like there is no tomorrow. Every time I check the bowl it is empty. Considering the fact that those spoiled rotten creatures are picky and will better starve than eat food they do not like, I am happy as long as my babies are happy."
1,"my yorkiepoo ate it like a treat... we mixed it with his pedigree to transition him on the new food. Haven't seen any changes in his bowels as of yet. I was initially worried about his kidney, based on another review since he's a small dog.  If anything changes I will update it here."
1,These pouches have a tendency to be quite expensive if you go to places like Petco or small boutiques. Our cats personally like all of the flavors that these Wellness pouches come in but we try to order the grain free ones. We don't give them the whole pouch at once and even when they stay in the pouch they don't get as crusted over and stale as when they are in the can. Feeding your cats on the pouches alone however can become rather expensive and we normally supplement the pouches with dry food.
1,If it were up to my cat this would get 10 stars.  He is 15 years old and has decided he doesn't want kibble anymore and this is the only soft food he likes (Wellness Healthy Indulgence Grain Free pouches).  When I have tried other soft food he loses weight because he refuses to finish it or to eat it at all.  I guess he knows what food is the healthiest!<br /><br />I gave this only 4 stars because of the price.
1,"Definitely healthy & tasty food.  Both my cats really like it. Grain-free, a plus for cats who get ""tummy trouble"" on cheap food or are just super-picky. No byproducts. BUT, it's REALLY expensive, even when compared to other Wellness produts.  The pouch has a lot of ""juice,"" so even at the same # of ounces, Wellness grain-free canned products have more ""food,"" and are a much better value."
1,"When Princess came to me, she was on mostly dry food. She didn't seem to interested in her food, and used to dump it into her water before eating it. Her previous foster mum suggested I get her moist food. Then started the search. I purchased cans and pouches. And she didn't seem to interested in most of them. I did find pouches she liked, but they were discontinued. So I found these, and Princess just love them!<br /><br />The thing that Princess likes is the texture. The pouch consists of a square of grain-free food and sauce. The square is about 1cm by 1 cm. The recommendation is to give one pouch per 4 pounds per day, which should be 2 pouches for my 9 pound cat. Well, I tried that, but she put on weight. So I give her 1 pouch per day, plus as much grain free dry food as she likes. She's lean and active, and loves her pouches. I pay an arm and a leg for it, but as long as my Princess is happy, I cannot complain. I've tried cans in the same brand, and she just looks at me like I am crazy. She definitely love this brand, and get different taste every day. And a happy cat makes a happy mum :)"
1,"All three of my cats love this food, this is the only food that they'll finish off in one sitting!<br /><br />My cats were mostly on Pate Style but I was frustrated because I was throwing a lot of it away because they wouldn't finish it all, so I decided to try this out. I purchased a few different flavors but they prefer Tuna the best. They'll eat the Salmon & Tuna but not with as much gusto as the regular Tuna flavor.<br /><br />My female cat who has strange ways of eating her food did not appreciate the size of the chunks so before I opened up the pouch, I squished the food so it was not in large pieces. This also helps the the gravy absorb in the food so it's not a soup. I now squeeze the pouches for all my cats, they like it better this way.<br /><br />Also, if it stays at the $28.56 price on Amazon, it's the exact same price in the stores."
1,"This is the only wet food that my kitties like (and boy do they like it!). Wellness is expensive in comparison to grocery store brands, but the quality is superior and I believe the price is worth it. Amazon has the best prices I've found."
1,"Definitely healthy & tasty food.  Both my cats really like it. Grain-free, a plus for cats who get ""tummy trouble"" on cheap food or are just super-picky. No byproducts. BUT, it's REALLY expensive, even when compared to other Wellness produts.  The pouch has a lot of ""juice,"" so even at the same # of ounces, Wellness grain-free canned products have more ""food,"" and are a much better value."
1,My 2 cats eat Wellness grain free in cans in the turkey and chicken flavors.  I thought I would try the  pouches in this turkey & chicken grain free  recipe to see if they would eat chunky food. They loved it from the first taste. They eat the chunks first and then lick the gravy.  80 calories a pouch. So now they eat both Wellness canned and pouches. I feel like they are eating very healthy and getting the needed water in their food. Amazon always has it packaged well and I get it fast.
1,"My cat loves these. We call them packets and she perks up and gets excited if we say packet. we call her packet cat. haha. anyway. This is way over priced on here though.. I get them for .95 cents each.. that adds up to $22 for 24, not $30 for 24 like they are on sale for here. I get mine at stateline pet supply in plaistow nh. I would look around before purchasing them for thebest price if i were you."
1,"I have a VEEEEERRY fussy 2 year old Ragdoll cat who cannot eat dry food (it makes him throw up) and he hates most all canned foods.  (And I know, because I have tried them all!)  Thankfully, I found this food before he starved to death!!!  He really likes it -- he will even lick the bottom of his bowl clean (and he NEVER did that before!)  The food is not pate' style -- it is actually soft, moist little ""rectangle"" shapes of food in a light sauce/gravy.  I am very happy with the ingredient list, and the fact that it is a high-quality, nutritious, premium food for my fussy boy!"
1,"Even with shipping charges this is still cheaper than purchasing from a pet store, plus it arrived quickly. My cat is 15 and was developing health issues, the vet said he needed more water content and this brand has the best gravy ever. I switched him from an all dry diet to two pouches a day of Wellness, with a bit of dry sprinkled on top and he loves it. Cleans the bowl!"
1,Most of my cats really like this Wellness Turkey and Duck flavor food. I wish the sauce was a little thicker like the other varieties. Wellness makes high quality pet foods with great ingredients that are good for our pets.
1,"My cas love this high quality, healthy food. Wellness pouches are a great food for all cats of all ages."
1,"Excellent, high quality product. In particular a great way to get your finicky kitty to consume more liquids, as the gravy seems irresistible even for the most picky of eaters."
1,"My cats love this food and one of them doesn't usually touch canned food.  I know that canned food is much better for them and I feel better that this product does not include unhealthy grains.  There is a lot of juice in this, but the picky cat really likes to lick up the juice. I haven't seen any problems with vomiting since I switched them to this."
1,"This is my cat's favorite wet food.  He really prefers most dry foods, but we feed him wet food for its moisture content.  He is on a low carbohydrate diet.  The Wellness pouches are his favorites."
1,"I was looking for a new cat food for my cat who is almost 2 years old - he enjoyed his old food, but after reading some articles on the differences in some popular brands I felt compelled to give him a more nutritious product that contained less fillers. I searched online to learn about a variety of product and decided that Wellness was the way to go.<br /><br />My cat isn't picky about his food per se, but he does have distinct likes and dislikes, he loves this stuff! I switched him to 1/2 cup Wellness Dry food and 1/2 pouch of Wellness Healthy Indulgence.  He always eats the gravy first and then will come back for the meat chunks but he eats everything without fail.<br /><br />The results are what have made me a convert and I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. My cat's coat is incredibly soft now and he remains active, alert, and very energetic (not overly!).  The coat is really the one place I see a significant change - he had a great coat before, but after a few weeks on this Wellness combo his coat is even softer and vibrant."
1,"My picky cat loves Wellness cat food. He will eat the pouches but he prefers the can style cat food. However, either one will work...my cat digs Wellness cat food."
1,"My two Siberian cats turn their cute little noses up to run of the mill pate-like cat food, if you have cats that demand to eat at five star restaurants, this might be an option, more expensive but I got tired of throwing out barely eaten bowls of all its competitors."
1,"Princess gets a pouch of food every morning. I rotate so she doesn't have to get the same every day. She usually have three different at any given time. This was the first time I purchased Turkey and Duck. These seem to be harder to get out of the pouch than the others I've tried.<br /><br />I first shake the pouch to get everything to settle in the bottom, then I pull it open. So far, so good. But when I then turn it over, the food gets ""stuck"" in the pouch a bit. So I usually make sure I open the opening first and shake it a little bit around, turn it on its head, and start milking it out. That seems to work.<br /><br />The Princess seems to like it, so I will continue buying."
1,"When we adopted our cats several years ago, our vet told us it was really important to feed them wholesome food from the beginning (they were kittens at the time).  She recommended Wellness brand, so we picked up several of the flavors of both wet and dry food for the cats to try.<br /><br />Both of our cats immediately loved the ""nuggets in gravy"" style wet food over the more common pate style and we haven't tried a flavor that they won't eat (although they do strongly prefer the seafood flavors over chicken or turkey).  I like the fact that the ingredients are whole foods - no fillers or cheap grains.  Although not in this combination, they're foods I eat myself - salmon, cranberries, flaxseed, zucchini, etc.<br /><br />I consider this food a win-win because the cats love the taste and texture and I love that they are eating whole foods that contribute to their silky, shiny coats and general well-being."
1,"My two cats love this food! In combination with the Wellness Indoor Cat dry food, I think it's the best diet you can feed an indoor cat. My brother, an animal breeder, recently told me that every pet food on the market is full of fillers, preservatives, and substandard ingredients. He changed his tune when he read the ingredients on a package of Wellness."
1,My kitties eat Wellness grainfree canned food and I wanted to try the pouches after others told me their cats loved them.  So do mine!  They eat the chunks first and then lick the gravy.  So now I feed them both the canned and pouches.  I love Wellness food for my cats.
1,I have a male cat who's 12 who has to be on a grain-free diet or he breaks out (like his mom!) :)<br />He also doesn't drink enough water so this moist food encourages him to eat (he's PICKY) and is good to his system.  He likes this much better than some of the other brands we tried.
1,"I decided it was time to start feeding my senior cat a wet food diet. She has a tendency to turn her nose up at most of the ""healthy"" choices, but she absolutely devoured this one. Several months later, she is still loving it and practically licks the bowl clean!  It has made a world of difference in her energy level, her coat is shiny and it has cut down on the amount of waste in the litter box.  The ingredients are all natural and my vet recommended this as one of the top choices of wet food for my cat.<br /><br />The food is in smaller size chunks with a LOT of gravy.  The pouch is easy to rip open, or can be cut. I highly recommend it as a healthy choice and for your finicky feline :)"
1,"My cat loves the tuna recipe so much, it is the only food she'll gobble down in a single sitting.  Interestingly, she doesn't to be as keen on the other flavors.<br />She seems to especially enjoy the gravy, almost slurping it down!<br />I give her one pouch a day and free-feed her dry, grain-free kibble.  She's healthy and lean, and her coat is silky and luxurious.<br />Maybe it's because I once owned a 96-pound Labrador that ate me out of house and home, but I cannot understand why people would think spending $1 and change per day to feed a pet is expensive...<br />For the price of a soda, you can feed your beloved pet a grain-free, quality cat food.  In reality, the junky, mass-marketed supermarket brands are a real waste of money, because you are paying for filler ingredients and added junk.<br />$1.20 a day is a bargain for the convenience, the quality, what it does for my cat, and how much she enjoys it. I certainly fitter away more than that each day on myself, in the way of ""indulgences""!<br />I know that the economy is bad and there are certainly a lot of people who have fallen on hard times, but for those who can afford to keep a pet in the first place, the cost of higher quality food shouldn't be a deterrent."
1,"Our vet recommended these pouches for our 2 cats to help them loose weight.  Dry food is full of carbs, and he suggested wet food since it's mostly protein and fat - what they would be eating in the wild.  Needless to say our picky felines love the food, their coats are shiny....and we'll see if they loose the extra lbs!  We've also tried other flavors of this food, but this is their fave!"
1,"Definitely healthy & tasty food.  Both my cats really like it. Grain-free, a plus for cats who get ""tummy trouble"" on cheap food or are just super-picky. No byproducts. BUT, it's REALLY expensive, even when compared to other Wellness produts.  The pouch has a lot of ""juice,"" so even at the same # of ounces, Wellness grain-free canned products have more ""food,"" and are a much better value."
1,"Our cat is allergic to grain and just loves this food as a special treat.  With the shipping, the cost is too high to use it as a main food, so we cook his everyday meals."
1,"I originally became a fan of pouch-based cat food with the Nutro line of pouches. However, Nutro was especially hit by the nasty recall episode from a few years back where a number of pet food manufacturers had contamination issues, and they eventually pulled their pouches. I tried a bunch of canned foods afterwards, but my cats never warmed to any of them like they did the pouches.<br /><br />Wellness came out with their ""healthy indulgence"" line of pouch foods not too long ago, and interestingly the packaging is pretty much identical to the Nutro products, down to the notches to facilitate tearing. I can only imagine that they are using the same manufacturing facilities as Nutro did, but hopefully with a superior product. Everything I've read about Wellness suggests that they make high-quality pet foods. My cats seem to love these as much as they did their old pouch foods. They have now been eating pouch foods almost daily for at least 6-7 years, so I don't have any major concerns about long-term health issues.<br /><br />Overall, these pouches are great. Each single pouch is one serving for one cat, so the costs do add up fast if you have multiple cats and serve this twice a day. I give dry food in the morning and the pouches at night to help conserve costs, but they always finish the Wellness pouches within a half hour, whereas the dry food often sits around unfinished all day. Another plus is that no spoons or forks need to be involved, since you just tear each pouch and shake the contents into the bowl. No mess or debates with spouses about putting cat food forks into the dishwasher with the rest of the dishes!"
1,"My boyfriend bought a pack as a one-off to tempt his aged kitty- who can be finicky- into eating. His Kitty was uninterested at the time, so I took it home to my little eating machine, who wolfed it down. She's been eating Wellness products almost exclusively for the past two years, and I was interested in finding a gravy-rich wet food in this line. The tuna chunks are substantial - but not too big - and are in a thick, rich gravy. I feed her a mix of 1 pouch of wet food and 1/2 cup of dry daily, and she is both happy and of normal weight. I highly recommend this food for being grain-free, as my cat has had issues with extra fiber clogging her digestive tract in the past, and free of odd, unrecognizable (and unpronounceable) ingredients."
1,I've been looking for this cat food locally; it seems that everybody is either out or doesn't carry these flavors.  This was great!  Fast Service at a great price.  I will definitely buy here again!
1,"Definitely healthy & tasty food.  Both my cats really like it. Grain-free, a plus for cats who get ""tummy trouble"" on cheap food or are just super-picky. No byproducts.

0,"The ""Healthy Indulgence"" pouches of cat food are prepared with FLUORIDATED water! A number of studies have now shown that fluoridated water increases the risk of osteosarcoma or bone cancer in humans and animals. Alone from my own circle of friends, two have lost their pets to bone cancer, most likely as a result of the animals' having consumed fluoridated water! BUYER BEWARE!"
0,"A real waste of $$$ - Don't know what I was expecting...the product's own PR only makes vague claims for renewed health after drinking this over 2 days.<br />Didn't bring about any sort of ""cleanse"" (as in colonic) for me; don't feel any better (or worse); bloating not reduced; energy level still low.<br />Does, indeed, taste horrible but I actually got used to it - it was only for 2 days! Very bitter with a sort of stale oil smell/taste, which might be from the acai since the fluid contains no oil products.<br />The only Maybe Possible good thing is that it keeps you on a schedule, making you very aware of when you're supposed to drink your ""cocktail"" and what you may have eaten since the last drink...subconciously keeps you a bit more honest on your diet??<br />It didn't harm me, didn't give me gas or headaches, didn't interrupt my sleep or make me jittery - but the same could be said for a lot of low-cal food items (H2O, anyone?).<br />Stick to Vitaminwaters, Lean Cuisines and more exercise!"
0,the little wax bottles had melted together in a big messy blob of wax with the liquid leaking out in all directions.
1,"Got this just in time for Christmas for a buddy who loves Wax Bottle candy. I was worried about it being squished in shipping, but it was VERY well packaged! The candy was intact AND delicious! Will be buying candy here again!"
1,"These are great treats that I wish Amazon.com carried as part of its regular stock. These are essentially wax bottles of flavored sweets in them that vanish quickly when you're doing mindless work. Just bite off bits and chew them until the liquid is gone, then spit out the wax. They taste great and nice treats for kids as well. Summer candy they ain't, and the wax can melt unless shipped with an ice pack. The downside is the shipping price."
1,"I live in Florida but the wax arrived in perfect condition. The liquid is also much sweeter than the packs i buy at the local toy store. If i had seen the bag on the shelf for this price, i never would have bought it."
1,"I love these thing, I love chewing and drinking the juice. nostalgia! Who doesn't love these things? Just know I like em."
1,I don't know why but my kids love these. I must admit that they actually do taste good and I remember as a kid I loved them. Big hit with the kids!
1,"My boyfriend was telling me one night that he uses to love these but couldn't find them anymore, well i found this one pound bag for him and sent it to him directly and make him very happy for a few hours"
1,I remember these from when I was a kid...they haven't changed a bit.  Yummy drink inside the wax bottle.  My 8 year old son and his friends love them
0,"The wax candy arrived in one big wax blob.IT was too much of a pain in the butt to send back,so I threw it away.TOtal waste of my hard earned money! It says returns are easy...NOT TRUE!!!"
0,"They were indeed tasty, but I guess I just don't understand the appeal. A small amount of liquid encased in wax. It has a certain novelty to it, but mostly it's just odd. I am sorry if my rating seems undeserved by people who like this candy. It's not that I don't appreciate old-fashioned candy. Some of it is great. But some of it went out of style for a reason."
1,"Everyone that has ever had this tea at my house absolutely loves it. Beautiful  natural red color and great taste, make this the best ice tea ever."
1,"This was bought as a Christmas gift.  It arrived well packaged and the gift was well received.  Hershey Chocolate Kisses are just that, the wrapping was Christmas like."
1,My dog loves this flavor. Quality of cookie overall is very good. This particular smell drives him crazy!! On Amazon I get much chipper than in a store.
1,"Dogs love them and they are made the best way, They are about $4.00 cheaper that the pet stores and no tax"
1,"Old Mother Hubbard treats are the best and at a reasonable price. Their treats come in a lot of different sizes and flavors. They offer a variety of products that all dogs will love. My three black labs love the peanut butter and Bac'N""Cheez."
1,"I have been buying Marge's vegan products for a while now in Whole Foods.  When I made the decision to become a vegan, it didn't take long for me to start to miss desserts that had the real stuff.  The taste and texture weren't the same, until I found Marge's.  Their vegan products taste better than the real thing.  Their carrot cake is better than any other that I have had before.  I also like that they use non-GMO oils and organic sweeteners.  It takes the guilt out of giving my kids sweet treats every now and then, and they love eating them. I have purchased their cookies and breads many times and given them as family, friend and client gifts, but I am so excited that I can now order them on Amazon and Marge's will do the work by wrapping and shipping everything for me.  If you are looking for the perfect gift for anyone, vegan or not, Marge's is definitely the answer."
1,"OK I have to admit that the first time I tried to buy this tower of treats was on Valentine's Day.  I accidentally ordered the non-vegan version so my sons and nephew ate half of it, then when we weren't looking the dog ate all the rest.  I ordered the vegan tower of treats (same items as the regular one, but without animal-based ingredients).  All of the treats were delicious!  I must say that if I could get a tower of just their vegan carrot cakes I'd buy that too!  That carrot cake was simply incredible!  The dog did not get a chance at these treats this time!  I will buy this vegan tower of treats for every special occasion."
1,"I had a sample at the Albanese factory in Indiana, and this is the best gummy candy they had. Don't get me wrong, I liked the other candy like the gummy bears and stuff but this was the tastiest one ever!!! I recommend this candy to anyone that likes sweet stuff."
1,Not the best gummy rings out there. They are very good though. If you are a hater of sweet don't get them ;). I myself have little to complain about. Huge gummy ring fan. Buy them and enjoy!
0,"I ordered these along with some of the sour bears to try from this Albanese brand.  I received a box of melted candy that was unrecognizable. It was warm still in Arizona in September, but this was something you would expect to happen to chocolate candy but not to gummi rings or bears.  Be warned if you order this brand in warm months you may open the box to find a scary looking surprise. This has never happened to me with the Haribo brand so I will stick to those from now on.  Amazon did refund the price, they are great about that if you call them up and whine a little."
1,"This stuff is so tasty, especially the caramel flavor. So easy to make, too. Hard to believe something this good comes from a powdered mix."
1,"Please eat Organic Grass Fed Liver products. They contain the nourishing benefits that make liver worth eating. I had not eaten liver in decades because I didn't want to eat the regular super market variety, but after finding a product not laced with antibiotics, I gave it a try. Very tasty."
1,"Best cornbread in the world if you're looking for TRUE cornbread from the South !!  NOT SWEET, YAY !!  You can't go wrong ! Great with just about everything !"
0,"The actual Chestnut Cream itself was wonderful. It is a favorite of my mother's from her home country of France. The problem is not with the product, but with the shipping. The first time I ordered it for her, all six cans were so dented in the box that we were scared to open them. The one piece of packing material,a completely deflated ballon, did not keep the cans from rolling around in a box way to large for them. Amazon did resend us the product at Amazon's expense (best customer service ever!), but once again the bag was nearly flat and the can were very damaged...except one and that one was very tasty though it cost $26. My advice don't buy can goods through the mail."
1,"I use this fab tasting cream for my prize winning Chocolate Chestnut Torte and I have absolutely no complaints about this product.  I received my package quickly and without damage.<br />I highly recommend Minerve chestnut cream as it is smooth, not at all gritty, blends well and is not too sweet.<br />Great in the ice cream maker for chestnut gelato!"
1,"This is amazing tea. It is a ""pick-me-up"" for your immune system. Great for colds, flu, congestion, pneumonia, etc. It is naturally sweet with stevia leaf. Wonderful for preventitive measures as well."
1,This tea has a wonderful soothing flavor and aroma that is good any time of day.  The Stevia gives it just the right amount of sweetness and the other ingredients blend well.  Very nice.
1,My granddaughter loves pretzels and cheese when she comes home from Pre-school.<br />Then they dissapeared.  I could not find them anywhere for about a year.<br /><br />I am glad they are back.
1,I do not know why more stores do not carry these. The cheese has just the right texture for dipping and has a nice cheesy taste.
1,"I don't think I'd be a girl if I didn't love chocolate.  I don't think anything could be better than matching raspberry with chocolate.  My sister-in-law buys these chocolate covered raspberries (in bulk!!!) and so I ordered this matcha hoping that it would satisfy me enough so I wouldn't steal her stash and become 400 pounds!  I opened this matcha and was pleasantly surprised to smell chocolate!  I couldn't seem to smell the raspberry in it.  I put it into a tin to keep it fresh, if it'll make it very long.  The small size fits perfect in the tin with a little wiggle room...enough to be able to get the measuring spoon in.<br />I really wasn't sure how I wanted to prepare this matcha.  First I prepared it with just 1 tsp matcha and 16.9oz of water.  It was ok, but not really what I was looking for.  I seemed to get more chocolate from it this way and not enough raspberry flavor.  SO, next I heated up some milk, added a bit of sugar and frothed it up into a latte.  Now here is where I get more of the raspberry.  It's a nice creamy truffle.<br />On a side note, I'll be learning to make truffles from tea as a local tea shop this week so maybe I'll be able to use what I have left in making a tea truffle!  You can never go wrong with chocolate and raspberries that don't make you gain weight.<br />THANKS again Red Leaf for another wonderful matcha creation....keep'em comin'!<br />To get your own tasty Raspberry Truffle Matcha from Red Leaf Tea - GO HERE NOW!!!!<br />[...]"
1,So I just have to say this matcha is delicious!  It tastes like a rasberry truffle and the lingering taste after you drink it is exactly like the lingering taste that is left when you eat an actual truffle.  Besides the great taste Red Leaf has terrific customer service!
1,This reminds me of summer. Just picked berries on the vine paired with a sweet matcha and chocolate. Did I mention the chocolate?  Yum!
1,"My daughter picked this one out - she LOVES truffles and of course raspberry is one of her favorites. She has not got to try it yet as she is at work but I had to sneak a bit since I was putting my matcha powders into their tins.<br /><br />So this one has a very nice raspberry flavor, although I seem to be missing the chocolate flavor, not that I taste no chocolate but its not like the chocolate matcha flavor.  However truffles have a very distinctive flavor to them - which for me is difficult to describe, but this does taste very true to an actual truffle and not simply to flavors of matcha mixed together. So its not just some chocolate flavor with raspberry flavor but however this was blended with whatever ingredients it is true to that truffle aroma and flavor. I wish I could explain the flavor I am talking about maybe it is some kind of special nut oil that is used or something but there is just a flavor to truffles that is different and this matcha absolutely has captured it!<br /><br />So today I began with the preparation of the matcha and was going to do my typical latte but last minute before adding the creamer decided to use a scoop of natural vanilla ice cream hubby was so lovely to pick up for me. So my blend included the prepared matcha along with some ice cubes, a quarter cup of milk, and a small scoop of ice cream. It was not that amazing of a plan since the ice cubes and ice cream wanted to be stubborn but I took a long tea spoon and mixed it up and ate it something like a float.<br /><br />Mmmmm absolutely delicious! The raspberry truffle flavor popped along with the creamy ice cream here and there in a milky frothy treat!<br /><br />The lingering after taste is what is most astounding! I had this matcha latte shake concoction over 15 minutes ago and I am still tasting raspberry chocolaty goodness in my mouth!<br /><br />Of course as always Red Leaf Tea's matcha base is outstanding!"
1,"As I was considering which flavored matcha I would try next from Red Leaf Tea, I was stumped. There are so many amazing flavors! However, this Raspberry Truffle matcha caught my eye fairly quickly and I knew that I had to give it a try. I am a sucker for all things chocolate, particularly super rich truffles of all flavors. I had very high expectations for this matcha and I have to say that it more than exceeded my expectations! You can find out more about this matcha here: [...]<br /><br />Once again, I was very pleased by the intense aroma as I opened the package. I could have sworn that somebody just opened a very expensive box of raspberry truffles somewhere in my kitchen. The matcha was a very bright green color despite being flavored. I first tried this traditionally as a hot bowl of matcha in my chawan. Initially, the slight bitterness of the matcha hits your palate, but it is followed by an intense and slightly sweet raspberry flavor with the chocolate aspect occurring more in the aftertaste. I love how the aftertaste lingers several minutes after your last sip and I also appreciate that the matcha was very easy to whisk with no noticeable clumps. While this is a super awesome way to drink this matcha, I just had to try it as a cold latte since it is so unbelievably hot here in Texas.<br /><br />For the cold latte I added a healthy scoop of this Raspberry Truffle matcha and milk into a blender bottle and shook it all up. Once again the matcha blended beautifully without any clump which is something I've noticed in other matchas when preparing them with a cold liquid. Although I didn't add any sweetener, the matcha seems a little sweeter now, but not by any means overly so. I also think that the flavor profile is a bit more balanced at this temperature. The bitter edge of the matcha is almost non-existent and the raspberry and chocolate flavors are more unified as a raspberry truffle would be. It is quite refreshing on this hot day and I was impressed that it didn't settle out even after being left on the counter for 10+ minutes.<br /><br />Overall, this is another big success from Red Leaf Tea! Not only is the tea quite tasty, their customer service is amazing. My order arrived within 2 business days! If you haven't tried anything from this company, you are missing out!"
0,"I picked this up at my local Rite Aid. It was only a dollar for an 8pk, so I decided to try them. The fact that I could not find an exp. date should have been a warning. These are horrible, hard and firm like jujube, and leaves a nasty too-sweet-almost-bitter aftertaste. Global Brands is batting 0 for 2 so far. Their Sweet Obsession Dark Chocolate is also far off the mark."
0,"Perhaps these snacks are ten years old;  I tried, but failed, to find an expiration date.  These Fruit Snacks are firm with an almost crispy outer surface -and not much flavor to boot.  I bought these because Global Brand's Strawberry Fruit Snacks are pretty good (if not stellar);  I would steer shoppers toward that flavor or another product entirely."
1,Good price for the Chex Snacks.<br />Quick delivery and arrived in good condition.<br />Will order again...I have been quite pleased with the Amazon Grocery purchases I've made over the last few months.
1,"This is the tastiest snack I have ever eaten.  And, it's low in calories.  It has little pretzels, small cheese crackers, chex mix and other little crackers. Very delicious."
1,"Can't find these in the grocery store any more, so please keep them here on Amazon! Great snack!!  I Love them!!!"
1,Cold not find it in local stores.  One of my favorite snacks and only 100 calories per pack.  Excellent price.
1,This chocolate mousse is delicious! The directions are simple and easy to follow. It is truly a restaurant quality mousse that I would be proud to serve to anyone. It is also very versatile. I have used it for pastry filling and have even made little frozen mousse pops out of it. You  will love it!!
1,This mousse is so good that I'm giving it to everyone on my Christmas list! This mousse is to die for. Everyone I have ever served it to licks the glass clean. It is very easy to make and lives up to its claims.
1,"Delicious and super easy!  Made it for guests and they thought I was a genius.<br />Definitely worth trying out (plus, its fair trade and organic if you do want to give away your secret)."
1,"Nigella in Arabic are the Seed of Blessing.  The flavor is deep and savory, like a peppered oregano and something you just cannot put your finger on.  Musky and warm, it is pungent and cozy.  They are used from Spain to Pakistan.  If you have had them, it is most likely in string cheese, often from Armenia.  If you are from New York, they were frequently used in stead of caraway in rye bread.<br /><br />If you are a baker, try studding your crust with them, especially if you are using an egg wash.  Nigella love all starch, pasta, potato, rice and bread.  As before, they also fancy cheese.  If you cannot find Armenian string cheese, there are several domestic ones made without the seeds.  But they tend to be on the krafty side.  Trader Joe's may be the best of that lot.  Or go to your mexican market and get Oaxaca cheese, the kind you stuff chilies with, which is a good place to use them since they go with tomato sauce.  Middle Eastern halloumi or akawi work well.<br /><br />Or, go with farmers' type curded cheeses, whole milk cottage will do.  Just warm a spoon of seed in virgin olive oil until it hits your nose, but do not use high heat or you will burn the fat in the oil.  Cool and stir into the cheese.  Crumbled feta or blue are good.  Let it sit overnight or so if you want, just take it out of the refrigerator for an hour or so to bring it back to room temperature.<br /><br />Switch out the pepper for Nigella in your next ratatouille.  My favorite:  use a table spoon of seed in two of oil and two of butter, warm as before and fold in 200 grams or so of gorgonzola (dolce is decadent) and toss with a hot pot of your just drained fettuccine or pappardelle or even black squid ink pasta.  Just do not be too zealous in draining.  Some pasta water is nice.  Add a spoon or two if that is easier.  Garnish with fresh oregano, marjoram or basil.<br /><br />Prefer rice?  Use feta and kalamata olives or feta and small shrimp with blanched spinach.<br /><br />Get to know this seed.  You might see them labeled as charnushka.  Zamouri is a first rate source of highest quality and freshness."
1,"I recently switched from Splenda to Stevia.  I purchased Sweetleaf sugar packets with fiber, which are great, and now decided to try a flavored drop.  This one is very good!  Nice orange flavor, almost like a mandarin rather than an orange, and again, just like the packet, no aftertaste.  Very good, makes me want to try other flavors.  I only put 2-3 drops per 16oz, no more.  With Sweetleaf stevia, seems less is more, otherwise, you may get bitter taste.  Why did I switch from Splenda?  Turns out Splenda's glycemic index, a measure of the effects of carbohydrates on blood sugar levels, is higher than sugar!"
1,"I have been very happy with this product!  I have tried almost all the  flavors, but the Valencia Orange is my favorite.  I feel it is the most versatile of the flavors available.  I have been using this for over a year now and enjoy it on a daily basis in my water bottle and also add it to my tea, iced or hot.  A little goes a long way.  It is not too sweet but very light and refreshing.  Highly recommended!"
1,"I am not a fan of plain drinking water and this product is my saving grace.  Even fresh squeezed lemon doesn't do the trick for me!  A clear glass of water over ice with a few droppers of this makes you think you are drinking something sweet and exotic.  What a treat!  You have to be careful not to get it too strong, or it becomes almost ""bitter"".  I also always put a few drops of Valencia Orange in my water bottles to take with me before I leave the house!  This is a can't do without product for me.  I usually buy 2-3 of these a month and was absolutely THRILLED to find it on Amazon as a Subscribe and Save item.  I'm out in the country and always have to plan ahead to keep my supply going.  I have tried the Lemon Drop and Root Beer flavors, and while they are good, this is the one that I prefer!  You might even be able to break a child's juice or soda habit by using this or one of the other flavors!  This is much more economical and eco-wise than buying the fancy flavored bottled waters that abound in the market place.  I drink out of a quart Mason jar and recycle the empty bottle when I'm done!  It is also a good way to flavor and sweeten hot tea!"
1,"SweetLeaf Liquid Stevia, Valencia Orange is a great sweetener for my tea-hot or iced!  I use about one drop per ounce of beverage so a bottle lasts about as long as it takes me to drink the tea from a box of 100 tea bags. It is the same product I had been purchasing from a health food store but buying a pack of 2 as a subscription item from Amazon.com<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8O6CG"">Stevia Clear Valencia Orange 2 Ounces</a> is a wonderful bargain with free shipping too!"
1,"Great product! Lasts for a very long time and is ideal for the HCG diet! Tastes wonderful, really good with sliced lemons!"
1,"I use this with SodaStream to make flavored seltzer water and it tastes much better than SodaStream's brand. I have tried the vanilla, orange, and root beer and all have been great. Amazon price, especially on subscription is much cheaper than Sprouts; if I recall the cost of 1 was almost double the cost of 2 on Amazon."
1,"Plain water is just so ""Bla"". Now it has a great orange taste, and I'm drinking more of it. Just add a few drops and enjoy!!!  This has taken the place of drinking soda, now that's a ""good thing""."
0,"I have tried several flavors of Sweetleaf products, and have had no problems. The ones I recently received seem to be watered down. I used to be able to sweeten a one liter bottle of seltzer with two full squirts of the stuff. Now with two squirts, i barely taste it. My friend noticed the same issue with the Berry flavor i purchased for her!"
1,"I occasionally like to add a little flavor to my club soda or mineral water & this gives me a healthy choice. For me it's very sweet, because I really restrict my carb intake. It only takes a couple of drops in a 16 oz. bottle of water, to satisfy me."
1,"This is a great tasting sweetener. Compared to sugar there are no calories, and it doesn't give any of us stomach aches like artificial sweeteners often do.<br /><br />Between this and a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SKHQS4"">SodaStream</a> I have managed to kick a 4 can a day coke habit. It's not the same as a Coke, but it's something tasty and fizzy that I can drink liters of a day. We have the subscription for two bottles a month and use it up just before the new one comes."
1,"My daughter loves her orange water.  As a no sugar family, I was looking for a way my kids could still have a little sweetness in their life besides fruit.  This does the trick.  I am on super shipper saver even though I have prime because it comes automatically and I never run out!  This is a good price too. I originally bought this at a store and it was double the price."
0,"I got this to add to water, to help my son drink more. he hates it...and I dont like it either leaves a funny after taste"
1,This stevia valencia orange is great.  I put a few drops in my water bottle as I hate to drink water and it really lightens up the taste and therefore I drink more water.  Like the lemon stevia drops also.
1,"Love the orange flavor in my tea,smoothies and mixed with fresh lemon water. Sweetleaf is one of the best tasting stevias. Shipping was fast and wrapped securely."
1,I'm trying to get away from the sugar substitutes but love the flavors in my tea and coffee.  These stevia flavors are wonderful.
1,"I've been using Stevia as my sweetener for over 10 years. I've always used the KAL white powder Stevia, as I like the taste best of all. Now I found the SweetLeaf Luquid stevia, and at first I tried the Hazelnut flavor (yummy), and then I gave a try to Chocolate-Raspberry and Orange flavor. I love love the orange flavor in my coffee, oatmeal or Greek yogurt. It gives just gentle touch of orange, but you can definitely taste it."
0,"These Sweetleaf ""flavored"" products are only for people who want something really sweet with just the very barest whiff of some flavor (you probably won't even be able to tell which one it is). If you're looking for a product that's about half sweetness and half flavor, THIS ISN'T IT. I urge you to save your money and look for another solution."
1,"Excellent in every way,and the Amazon price is better than what you can find at a store ( if you can find this better-than-best version).<br /><br />I love to use the Fasta Pasta ( pasta cooker, also at Amazon) with this product--fast, and cooks to perfection.<br /><br />Kraft did an excellent job with this-- people LOVE it!<br /><br />ENJOY!"
1,"The best macaroni and cheese ever. Thank goodness for Amazon,can't find this in the grocery stores where I live. The bacon just adds a little something extra to set it aside from regular macaroni and cheese."
1,"It's got the creamy, cheesy flavor of the original with the added smokiness of bacon!  Quick, easy, delicious!"
0,"There is something just completely wrong with the way the bacon bits that are packaged with the Velveeta Shells and Cheese taste.  Additionally the cheese sauce does not taste the same as the regular Shells and Cheese sauce, and not in a good way.  Stick with the original."
1,This salt is a salt lovers dream come true. It is amazing on everything I've tried. I reccommend this salt for every home that has taste buds.
1,"This by far is the best tasting Stevia I have tried. I have tried different brands but they leave a bad taste in my mouth. Wisdom brand I have used for 6 years and have not been dissapointed. One thing to keep in mind is one tsp equils one cup of sugar approximately. I use a little less than a tsp of stevia to equal a cup of sugar. If you get a bitter taste you are using to much stevia. I use this primaryly to make Kool-Aid. Its cheaper than pop, all natural, zeor glycemic value, zero calories. I would recommend Wisdom brand stevia to anyone looking to cut processed, artifical sugar. Google Wisdom to find all products and recipe books."
1,LOVE IT!LOVE IT!LOVE IT!LOVE IT! Great gift for any FOODIE or anyone who is looking to cut back on other condiments. We use it on almost everything. Plus the croc it comes in looks very nice. Good value. YUmmy stuff.
1,I love this mustard. I first received it as a gift and got hooked on it. I put it on everything. It makes a better gift than the traditional bottle of wine when going to someone's  house for dinner. That's how I discovered it. It is hard to find in stores but easy to find on Amazon. The first that I had came from a fiend who brought it from France.
1,"ohhhh... this stuff is WONDEFUL!!!  Nothing else is quite like it.  The exquisite flavor not only adds to any mouthful of food but also wakes up the flavors of everything else you're eating.  Best mustard to go with prime beef.  Best mustard for sandwiches with lean meats, lettuce and fresh sprouts.  Best mustard with crackers and gourmet cheese (or, hey, just with crackers!).  A little goes a long way, and you feel coddled whenever you have some.<br /><br />We used to live near a gourmet food store where we could buy this whenever we ran out.  We got spoiled, and now it's VERY hard to find.  So great to see it on Amazon -- wow!!!!"
1,This is my favorite gourmet mustard.  It's a perfect recipe addition and condiment.  I buy it as a gift all of the time.
1,"These mints repulsed me after a whiff at a local candy, but I decided to get them anyway since they didn't have any latte mints. Once I tried them it was like:<br /><br />A unicorn<br />pooping glitter<br />whilst dancing on a rainbow<br />at a One Direction concert."
1,"great to pack in my kids lunch, and is a great way not to sit down and eat a whole pack at once...wish it was cheaper though"
1,"lapsang souchong tea is some of my favorite tea. it has a very distinct flavor, owing to it being smoked dried with pinewood.  the bags of tea say they make 20-25 cups of tea, but as this tea has a strong flavor to it, i used only a tiny bit of tea leaves per cup and managed to get ~35 cup with the one bag i've used so far.<br />overall im very satisfied with this purchase."
1,"I love this tea.  Ahmad tea is just a perfect cup of tea.  English Tea No. 1 is my tea of choice.  It's perfectly balanced and never bitter, no matter how long it's brewed.<br /><br />Incidentally, if you want to purchase English Tea No. 1 in it's loose form, you have to buy ""English Afternoon Tea"" loose.  Please note, however, that in teabag form, English Afternoon and English Tea No.1 are two distinct blends.  But in loose form, English Afternoon and English Tea No.1 are on in the same. I don't know why that's the case, but that's what a representative from Ahmad Tea told me when I emailed them to ask where I can buy English Tea No. 1 in loose form.<br /><br />I purchased loose English Afteroon Tea (aka Eng. Tea No. 1) from another online purveyor, and the loose version of the tea is just as delicious (maybe even more so) than the bagged version.  the loose tea is whole leaf tea, which is hard to find in a black tea.  usually, loose black tea is very finely shredded, not altogether different from its bagged form.  but the loose Ahmad black tea is whole leaf, which just goes to show how high the quality is at Ahmad tea.<br /><br />all in all, a terrific tea, and highly recommended."
1,"My family is from England and we love tea. We were given this tea as a gift. We were skeptical at first, but fell in love with it as soon as we tasted it. Truly a perfect tea! We love it as both hot tea or Sun tea!"
1,I received this tea in a house-warming basket and it is wonderful.  I could (and have) drink it all day.  I was so glad to find it on amazon but I think next time I will go straight through eurogrocer and save a couple of bucks.  But it is worth it!
1,"This is the smoosthest  blend of tea that I can remember drinking.  I have been a tea drinker for about 30 years.  We got a 10 pack in a gift basket for Christmas from my son and his wife. I am ordering more and it is not even noon Christmas day !!<br /><br />Remember drink responsibly, Hope you had a Merry Christmas"
1,This is the best tea I have ever had. It is smooth and delicious! I highly recommend it.
1,"I love this tea, the full bodied flavor and aroma is smooth and relaxing. Order the two packs of one hundred, the shipping is much less."
1,"I have been buying this tea for a while now from another store, so I already knew how good it is. In fact, I think this is the best tea one can get. I'm kind of hooked on it; I'm not even awake before I have my first cup in the morning.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a very convenient packaging for someone who drinks a lot of tea - 100 bags in one package. The package arrived really quickly, no problems whatsoever."
1,"I originally received this tea in a holiday gift basket.  I've been a tea drinker all my life, so I'm rather opinionated as to what I like and what I don't.  This is by far the best tea I've ever had!!  I can't find it locally, but have been lucky enough to find it on-line.  It has a very unique flavor that you just can't find in your typical Lipton or Red Rose tea."
1,"We received a gift basket with this tea in it for Christmas. When my wife tried it she couldn't get over how great it tasted. Being a tea drinker all of her adult life and fancying herself as knowing a good tea from a bad she just had to have a supply of this tea. We couldn't find a local store that carried it so we went to Amazon to order some. The company that we ended up with wasted no time in getting the tea to us without difficulty. Of course once you add in the shipping the price of the tea goes up, but that's a small price to pay in order to make my wife a happy woman."
1,"If you like tea, this is a tea that I think you will like very much. I love it. I am basically caffeine free, but on the weekends I indulge. I first tasted it from a collection of several teas that my cousins gave me for Xmas. I went looking for it here at Amazon, and was so glad to have found it."
1,"Makes the best tasting Iced tea, one of the best iced teas I've had. It also is a good hot tea. Great company"
1,This has become my favorite everyday tea. It's a great price and shipping is very reasonable.
1,The only problem with this tea is that you going through it too FAST:)Great flavor!Love it!!!
1,"We love this tea. Being of English extraction, we are used to drinking a strong English ""breakfast"" type tea. This has a very nice flavor, not overly strong unless you steep it a long time, with just a hint of bergamot to liven up the strong tea taste (much less bergamot than in Earl Grey). After reading another review of this tea from someone who said that Ahmad's English Afternoon loose tea is actually the same as their English Tea No. 1 in teabags, we also bought this in 7 oz tins from another vendor, and it does taste pretty much the same. I use the loose tea in my teapot, and the bags when making a quick ""cuppa""."
1,"Since I was diagnosed with type II diabetes, This is the only drink I drink. It taste great and has enough sweetness to it to be very satisfying."
1,"I don't personally eat this product so I can't vouch for the flavor and texture. I do, however, buy it here and buy it often as I donate it regularly to my church for their special dinners for the homeless, those in need, and fundraiser suppers.<br /><br />The pastor tells me that those who do the cooking for the church, as well as those being served enjoy it a lot and many ask for 'seconds'. The pastor advises me it makes a great side dish and helps to fill up hungry tummies  while being so easy to make. On occasion, the church cooks will add their own additional onions and celery, but it isn't necessary as this stuffing includes all that and more. And,because this is a 'herb' flavor, adding chicken stock or turkey stock vs. water makes it even more complimentary to a chicken/turkey meal.<br /><br />The price here at Amazon is better than that at the local grocery stores, esp. with my Prime for free shipping. I can also get it in 1-2 days if the church needs extra with short notice. Good deal, good product, prompt service.<br /><br />Edit: 2-25-10 (after-thought). All one needs to add to this product is butter and water. Depending on how moist/dry one prefers stuffing, simply add more/less water. Our church roasts turkeys and hen turkeys in large quantities very often and we strain and freeze the 'au jus' from them in 12 oz plastic containers. Occasionally, rather than using up our butter supply for stuffing, we substitute the defrosted au jus from the turkey. This seems to be the preferred 'flavor' by those enjoying the meals."
1,"This is boxed stuffing which -- as in all boxed foods -- in my mind is the equivalent of bland, bleh food. My husband, though, actually prefers this over my (sometimes) labor intensive homemade stuffing so I like to keep a quantity of it in the house for him. Making this according to the directions isn't something I've ever done so I can't really comment on that but I can say that with a quick few additions and substitutions, I can actually eat and enjoy this as well.<br /><br />First, I always use stock (usually chicken/duck -- whatever I have in my freezer) instead of water and add some sort of vegetable to it as well. Usually it's sauteed, grated carrots or zucchini but I've put everything in it at one point or another. I also add to the seasoning with whatever I think will taste good (sage is always great as well as any sort of chicken seasoning and I always add parsley if I have it fresh on hand).<br /><br />Here are some more suggestions to add to make your stuffing better that I've tried and liked:<br /><br />-- Cooked sausage -- breakfast sausage is always good but I've used brats and italian sausage as well and it's equally as good.<br />-- Bacon<br />-- Chicken livers (or turkey or duck or whatever you might be cooking)<br />-- Ground beef<br />-- Or you could go the fruit way and add apple, dried cranberries, raisins or even substitute some of the water for cider<br />-- Nuts (chestnuts and walnuts are what I've used)<br />-- Veggies -- Like I said above, grated carrots or zucchini is my standby but I always add onions, garlic, and sometimes celery or mushrooms as well.<br />-- Cheese -- parmesan in particular<br /><br />I also have a friend who swears by adding white rice to it as well but I haven't tried it (and personally think that that's an awful lot of carbs!)<br /><br />Also, as another reviewer has said, this is a fantastic donation item because it's easy to make as well as being very filling.<br /><br />Nutritional Information (1/6th of the box or 1/2 cup prepared stuffing):<br /><br />Calories: 150<br />Calories from Fat: 50<br />Total Fat: 1g **<br />Saturated Fat: 0g **<br />Trans Fat: 0g **<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 450mg<br />Total Carb: 21g<br />Dietary Fiber: 1g<br />Sugars: 2g<br />Protein: 3g<br />Vitamin A: 8%<br />Vitamin C: 0%<br />Calcium: 0%<br />Iron: 6%<br /><br />** (plus whatever butter you use)<br /><br />*** Contains both wheat and soy"
0,"Very disappointed in this stuffing mix. There was hardly any flavor. To get the ""Savory Herb"" taste, I had to add herbs and spices of my own and even then, it was still kind of tasteless. Canceled my ""Subscribe and Save"" on this one. Nothing like the ""Chicken Everyday"". Now THERE is the perfect seasoning!"
1,I have an elderly Rottie/Lab mix that I feed this food to.  I wet her dry food and add a good sized spoonful of this to her food.  She loves the taste and scarfs her food down instead of just sniffing it now. I'm very happy with this food and will be continuing to order it.
1,My Bichons like this and I like the ingredients.  Good for the price.  Wish it were on subscribe and save.
1,Both my chihuahua's love this moist healthy dog food. Nice that I can buy it locally but the price through amazon was much cheaper.
1,"I still remember when mom or one of my brothers prepared this dessert, it took longer to cook than the time we took to finish it. And is just great that I can make it now that I'm married and my loved ones can taste the same lemon pie like in the old days.<br />Easy to make easier to enjoy."
1,"The grocery chains don't seem to carry the cook and serve in lemon flavor, had to buy a case,ended up sharing with friends. Makes GREAT pie!"
1,"Have been using this product for years. It mixes up fast and consistant every time, makes a great pie. I have had difficulty finding this item @ my local grocery store. Was thilled to be able to order it from Amazon."
1,"The Maxwell House filter packs are a Great Idea for people moving Fast in the Morning. Four Cups a pack and you're Gone.<br /><br />Recently, Each Supermarket shopped has discontinued the De-Caf version of this product.<br />Found it on Amazon to my astonisment and order from them ever since."
1,I purchased the decaf and the regular because sometimes I need less caffeine or no caffeine. When I want a full pot I put one of each in it and have a full pot of half regular and half decaf. Amazon has the best price around and I hope they continue to carry this product.
1,"This product is ideal - I use it all the time.  It's just perfect for an afternoon or evening coffee break for 1 or 2 people, especially those who might be sensitive to caffeine later in the day.  I always keep this on hand.  The taste is rich, but not bitter like some of the newer coffee blends on the market."
1,My husband loves the Maxwell House coffee in the filter packs because there is no measuring and he can just put one in the coffee pot and he's got coffee. He had come across these filter packs while living out of town so when he came back home he wanted the Maxwell House filter packs.  With several grocery stores in our area we could never find this item.  I thought I'd check with Amazon.  What the heck?  Well there it was and it was cheaper than we'd ever seen it before.  Got him 4 boxes and no shipping.  He's happy as can be because I found a place to get his favorite coffee. Will be ordering again for sure!!
1,This coffee is not only delicious but convenient too.  It's so easy to use and not messy at all.  I think it's great.
1,"My Mom & Dad are at the age where they need things to be easy and this fits the bill.  My Mom loves this no mess way to make coffee and my Dad loves that there are in no grounds in his coffee, which is a problem with the small coffee makers. The best thing is that it is every bit as good if not better than the loose coffee.<br /><br />Our local supermarkets dropped the decaf version, so happy I found it here and love that it is shipped right to their door."
1,"It was so wonderful to see that I could get my loved Maxwell House Coffee to come to my house every two months for less than I could buy it in the store!  Great deal!  Great coffee!  Thanks, Amazon"
1,"The stereotype of decaf coffee is a bitter taste, but not with Maxwell House. This decaf coffee is flavorful and robust. And it is great to drink before bed."
1,The convenience of this filter pack is essential...and makes it easier for me to brew coffee in spite of my disability.
1,"This works real well for since I am unable for find Maxwell decaffeinated coffee in the local stores in or around Plano, Texas. Also I am the only coffee drinker in our house so with the pack it makes just the right amount for me to have my two cups in the morning. The fact that I have it on automatic reorder helps also."
1,"Coffee portions (cups) are 6 oz. If you like your coffee strong, you'll get one large 12-14 oz cup with one pouch. The flavor of this coffee is very good.  If you own a hotel type 4 cup coffee brewer like the Jerdon First Class, these work far better than trying to use #2 cone filters. Cone filters aren't meant to be used in hotel type round pouch brewing containers, the cone collapses and some grinds leak out. I gave up on square pouches with coffee, the square pouches let hot water drip by (in the round brew container) which dilutes the coffee. These are the best 4 cup round coffee pouches I've come across. These pouches are somewhat expensive per cup, but I only drink 2 cups a day."
1,"This is the greatest thing since sliced bread! No measuring, no thinking, no clean up. Yeah! Thank you Maxwell House for the convence of this product."
1,great service wish there were more then 4 to a order would perfer 6 at a time
1,"This is a product that makes coffee-making quick and easy.  You just put the coffee packs in the pot with no need for filters or measuring.  Unfortunately, many supermarkets have stopped carrying it."
1,"This seems to be the preferred nice and juicy meal for my fussy eater, Sweet Cee Cee. She dives into the dish and afterwards looks at me, and licks her chops as if to say to me ""now wasn't that NICE!!!""<br /><br />To the human nose it's pretty smelly, but I guess to Cee Cee it's nectar and ambrosia.<br /><br />This is one of many of Fancy Feast's diverse selections on ""the menu""."
1,"Short version: cat diagnosed with diabetes, insulin & Hill's prescription food not stabilizing glucose levels despite increasing insulin weekly over 4 weeks, switched food to Fancy Feast Classic Turkey and Giblets Feast, glucose levels normal after 1 week, decreased insulin dose dramatically, glucose still stable. May go off insulin completely soon. Thank you Fancy Feast. Please read full review below to learn why you should start feeding your cat (even if healthy) only Fancy Feast Classic Turkey, Chicken, Beef, or another WET food that has practically no plant based ingredients and has less than 10% of the calories from carbohydrates.<br /><br />Even if your cat isn't diabetic please read this review and the wealth of information by a vet at catinfo.org. My 12 year old cat was diagnosed with diabetes about 2 months ago. He is a big cat and about a year ago he weighed 22 pounds. Two months ago we noticed that he looked thin, so we took him to the vet. They discovered that he had lost 7 pounds (a third of his body weight in one year), was walking on his forepaws, and based on this checked his blood glucose. It was around 450, which is more than 400% higher than the normal level of less than 100.<br /><br />The vet followed the normal procedure for treating diabetic cats: insulin and ""prescription"" cat food (Hill's MD, dry). She did talk me into Lantus insulin, which is new (and more expensive), but has a chance of stimulating your cat's beta cells to start producing insulin again.<br /><br />We started my cat on 3 units of insulin, twice daily. I fed him the exact amount of Hill's I was supposed to. Came back for checkup a week later, glucose still off the charts. Up'd insulin to 4 units twice daily. Recheck: still through the roof. Up'd insulin to 5 units. At this point wife and I started reading online and found wealth of info at catinfo.org by a vet who specializes in treating diabetic cats. This vet is a crusader of sorts against the horrible diet we feed our cats. Cats are obligate (strict) carnivores. This means there diet should be almost 100% protein and fat, from animal ingredients. Your cat should have no more than 10% of there calories from carbohydrates. DRY FOOD, OF EVEN THE BEST QUALITY, CONTAINS MUCH MORE CARBS THAN YOUR CAT SHOULD HAVE. We discovered the Hill's food we were feeding had about 17% carbs (the canned version is about the same, so don't be fooled).<br /><br />After doing much comparison, we settled on Fancy Feast Classic Turkey & Giblets, because: (1) has only about 6% calories from carbs (2) first ingredient is turkey, other ingredients are liver,  by-products, that is, proteins & fat (3) it is sold everywhere, unlike high end canned foods (4) it is less expensive than high end canned foods (5) unlike the Fancy Feast Classic chicken or beef, it has no fish. Looking at (2) you may think ""eww...by-products,"" but for a cat, animal by-products, which are protein and fat from an animal, are better than plant based proteins and much better than carbs. Looking at (5), cats should not be fed fish very often, because the trace amounts of mercury in fish will build up in your cats body over time. But if your cat won't eat the Turkey, the chicken or beef would be the next best options. Make sure it is the CLASSIC style, as the other Fancy Feast brands have too many carbs.<br /><br />Back to my cat. So now we were up to 5 units of insulin, twice a day. Recheck: glucose still above 400. I tell my vet that we are switching to Fancy Feast and she agrees to keep insulin at 5 units. Recheck a week later: GLUCOSE LEVELS COMPLETELY NORMAL! Go down to 4 units, twice daily. Recheck: still normal. Down to 3 units, twice daily. Still normal.<br /><br />We are now down to 3 units of insulin, once a day. There is a good chance he will be off the insulin completely in the next few weeks. My cat has gained 2 pounds, has stopped drinking water and urinating constantly, and acts four years younger. Another bonus, on the expensive dry food we used to feed him he would throw up almost every single day. Now he only throws up occasionally when he has a hair ball. We also now feed are 18 year old cat this food only. She seems much more spry and happy.<br /><br />I know this is just one anecdote (although there are more on the web) and that the Lantus insulin may be the real reason for this turn of events, but I do believe personally that it was Fancy Feast that saved my cat."
1,"I have diabetic cat. My cat started exhibiting symptoms and I went to my vet who started him on insulin. He progessively got worse, as the insulin doses steadily increased. My super smart, very litter trained cat got completely out of his mind one night and climbed on top of a shoe box and peed. Poor thing didn't know where he was or what was going on.<br /><br />At that, I went to the internet and found yourdiabeticcat.com. I started reading and was so skeptical but out of pure desperation I started doing what the people on the boards there suggested. I started tracking my cat's blood sugar daily at home myself. I took him off of dry food and started feeding him fancy feast classics. His blood sugars eventually started leveling out.<br /><br />I went back to my vet and informed her of my changes with my cat and she was amazed. I asked her to research some concerns I had with the fancy feast. She researched it for me and told me the fancy feast is fine. My cat no longer gets insulin shots. I honestly couldn't believe it myself. He is back to his normal self: smart, energetic, and using his litter.<br /><br />I now buy this food automatically off of amazon in three different flavors for variety. I have two cats and they both love all three classic flavors that I buy. (Turkey, Chicken and Beef) I highly recommend this food for the health of your cat.<br /><br />Also, I have two large male cats and they eat an average of 3 cans a day each. Hopefully that will help you figure out how much you need for your cat. If for some reason, they get full and don't finish a full can in one sitting I have to cover up the left overs. They will not eat them if they have dried out, but they will eat them if I have covered them and allowed them to retain their moisture."
0,"I purchased this food because I am trying to feed my cats a near grain free diet and this is one of the few I could find.  That's the good part, well that and this is the only one of the purina fancy feast classics that didn't contain fish either!  Now, the bad part is that my cat would eat this about one can in twenty meaning there is a quality control issue.  After the some research on this matter, I came across the ugly....check out the reviews at consumeraffairs.com (just google consumeraffairs purina -- sorry but amazon site stripped the link when I inserted into the review).  So, be careful as Purina is the major supplier of most pet foods and after reading those HUNDREDS of complaints....they will never again get my business."
1,"My cats enjoy the Turkey & Giblets Feast from Fancy Feast.  I treat them once in a while and it's affordable on Amazon through the subscribe and save, especially when you keep an eye on the price and it drops below $12/24 cans (subscribe and save).  I noticed that the cats do not care for the grilled or sliced types, but they never turn down this ""pate"" or original style and it just disappears.  For us, it's a treat that supplements their regular dry food diet."
1,"I wish Amazon would get more of the ""classic"" pate varieties of Fancy Feast.  My cats won't eat the other types (shreds, lumps, pieces).  But they love the pate ""classic"" varieties.  Please get more flavors, Amazon!  I will buy them all!"
0,"This one was the reject surprise of the day.  Both cats wouldn't touch it at all - surprised me because one in particular is a turkey junky.  Can't figure this one out - it smells nice in the can, not strange odors that I can detect anyway.  It's pretty expensive to just toss but well, that's what I had to do.  It is healthy for your cat and it is a pate, not chunks.  However, that said, they don't care for the chunky Fancy Feast turkey variety either.  Not sure why - they gobble up the Friskies turkey and cheese like there's no tomorrow.  Not sure what to recommend here but to try it and see if your cat likes it.  Maybe it's just too boring! :)"
1,My cats really love this.  I have 4 cats and they all munch down. I have been buying it at Walmart but they seem to be changing their product line and sometimes I can't get it.
1,"This seems to be the preferred nice and juicy meal for my fussy eater, Sweet Cee Cee. She dives into the dish and afterwards looks at me, and licks her chops as if to say to me ""now wasn't that NICE!!!"""
1,"This is a good value, we save even more with scheduled monthly delivery. Really helps with a 4 cat family! Saves us about $2.00 over chain stores."
1,Good Healthy Pancakes.  Just delicious !!  My family loves these.  I freeze them for a hot quick  breakfast on the go!  Finally a whole wheat pancake!
1,"My Cats love it, I will order again.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFKHN8"">Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul Dry Cat Food for Senior Cat, Chicken Flavor, 18 Pound Bag</a>"
1,"I LOVE the Chicken Soup for dogs and puppies so I figured I'd love this for my cats. I'm not sure the quality is as great but it's almost up there with the dogs. Who knows, maybe I'm wrong and I need to look at ingrediants again? At any rate it's really good food - MEAT IS TOP INGREDIANT (CHICKEN) and the senior version has hairball control.  I'd like to see the regular offer the hairball control also but right now it doesn't.  I have multiple cats and they all love it!"
0,"package received was involved in the Diamond foods voluntary recall of Spring 2012.<br />I returned to a local store for replacement.  So much for SAFE, EASY online orders."
1,"I have three cats all varying in age. My oldest cat 9 yrs old gets allergies due to weather and well just about everything, he will tear his fur out if I give him cat food with filler, leaving little bald spots all over him. With this food he has stopped pulling his fur out, You have no idea how happy I am with this. I used to just give him cortizone shots at the vet to help his allergies but not anymore. I've tried many cat foods and so far this is the best! My other cats love this food as well. I tried the light chicken flavor of this food, however it gave two of my cats the runs, though my older cat still wasn't pulling his fur out. This current food for senior cats makes two of my cats stool not runny but not super solid either, but I will accept this change if it stops my cat from ripping his fur out and being all twitchy. All of my cats seem more healthier with this food, I've been feeding them this for about 6 months now just forgot to write a review."
1,"We have a 10 year old cat who will eat anything, people or dog food included, but then gets sick.  We have tried every kind of cat food on the market and this is the only one she can eat daily and not get sick off of.  It is also wonderful at preventing hairballs.  The only time we find her getting sick is if she has been out of dry food for a few hours and then pigs out when we refill it.  I think that is just her eatting to fast and trying to jam in to much food at once.  Otherwise, by far the best food.  We also use the wet food and give her a small tablespoon size serving as a ""treat"" when the dog get his breakfast and dinner.  She then has access to this dry food all day and night long.  Give it a try.  We couldn't believe it but are so glad we gave it a shot."
1,"We have tried several brands (Iams, Blue Buffalo, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Wellness Core, etc) and formulas (Digestive Health, Sensitive Stomach, etc.) over the past six years and nothing helped Mollie's daily vomiting. For months on end, we would scrub mounds of throw up. Finally, after doing some research, I decided to give Chicken Soup a try. She loves it, and the mounds are almost non-existent! We feel relieved to have finally found something that works with and for Mollie."
1,"I absolutely love this gum. The whole calcium from milk idea is perfect for gum that is meant to help take care of your teeth. This together with xylitol makes this, by far, my favorite gum to buy.<br /><br />The one reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is I REALLY wish Trident would get rid of the Aspertame. The gum would be sweet enough without it, especially with the flavorings and xylitol already in it. If Trident did that one thing, this would be the standard of all dental care gums.<br /><br />=========<br /><br />ALSO, what's the deal with the high price for this 12 pack on here? Someone else already pointed this out in the reviews, but it definitely needs to be mentioned: This is listed at about $1.74 per pack when buying in bulk, but my local grocery store sells the stuff individually for about $1.50, and I've even seen it on sale for $0.99. The price really needs to come down.<br /><br />========="
1,the gum lasts a long time and tastes great.worth the money if you like sugarless gum.
0,"For the health-conscious - read the ingredients.<br /><br />Aspartame:<br /><br />Aspartame accounts for over 75 percent of the adverse reactions to food additives reported to the FDA. Many of these reactions are very serious including seizures and death. A few of the 90 different documented symptoms listed in the report as being caused by aspartame include: Headaches/migraines, dizziness, seizures, nausea, numbness, muscle spasms, weight gain, rashes, depression, fatigue, irritability, tachycardia, insomnia, vision problems, hearing loss, heart palpitations, breathing difficulties, anxiety attacks, slurred speech, loss of taste, tinnitus, vertigo, memory loss, and joint pain.<br /><br />According to researchers and physicians studying the adverse effects of aspartame, the following chronic illnesses can be triggered or worsened by ingesting of aspartame: Brain tumors, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, chronic fatigue syndrome, parkinson's disease, alzheimer's, mental retardation, lymphoma, birth defects, fibromyalgia, and diabetes.<br /><br />Aspartame is made up of three chemicals: aspartic acid, phenylalanine, and methanol.

1,"My dentist actually recommended this gum, but I was already chewing it. It has great texture and doesn't get tough in my mouth. I have pretty thin enamel so I'll take any help I can get to avoid more fillings!"
1,"I loooooooooove this tea! It is simply delicious; I have shared it with many friends, and it's always a hit. Anyone who loves ginger will love it. The Tulsi adds a wonderful depth to the flavour that seems to mix very well with the ginger (I have also ordered the Organic India Tulsi Jasmine tea and was very disappointed; the Tulsi tasted kind of odd... I got used to it, but it was far from 'delicious'.) If you like sweet things, add honey. One word of caution: it takes a little trial and error to get the brewing length right for this tea; if you steep it too long it can (like any ginger tea, in fact) develop an unpleasant bitter taste."
1,"I looked everywhere for red foil covered kisses. I finally found them!  They arrived quickly, and were packed perfectly, as not to melt, or get crushed..."
1,"I was somewhat dubious when I ordered these sour belts as a Christmas gift for my (candy-addicted) younger brother, as I have repeatedly had my heart broken in the past by sour belts that were decidedly... UN-sour.<br /><br />(Nothing is worse than craving the acidic, tangy *pop* of sour candy, only to have your taste buds duped by a too-sweet, sugary let-down of flavor.)<br /><br />Well imagine my delight when these sour belts slapped my tongue with tartness like a cranky old granny at a Church luncheon! Just as sour as the ones you find at the mall candy shops, and incredibly convenient, as they come in large tubs.<br /><br />Totally delicious and totally recommended.<br /><br />Beware, though: Since there are so many belts in a single tub, you may find yourself over-indulging and burning yourself from an excess of the citric acid on these babies... If this happens, you'll be left with a raw, stinging tongue that may take a couple of days to heal. Granted, this only happens if you eat like, thirty-five in a single sitting, but still... it's possible. I speak from (shameful and disgusting) experience.<br /><br />Still, when eaten in moderation, these are a great snack, a great replacement for love, a great way to gain weight, and a great way to spend your time!<br /><br />Grab them by the fistful and shove them in your face!!!"
1,"Hi again,<br /><br />I will just say, you will love these sour belts.<br /><br />Take care"
1,Very fresh you can not find the watermelon very often in the store.If you do they cost per pc 10 to 20 cents each. Love them &lt;3
0,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Sour Power fan...<br /><br />Peach, Strawberry, Strawberry Bananna, Green Apple, Blue Raspberry, I love them all.<br /><br />But this is my first time trying the watermelon flavor...and it just has some major problems.<br /><br />Or really, just one big problem.<br /><br />The sour coating on the outside is classic Sour Power, which is great...but the belts themselves have a REALLY off putting plastic flavor that comes as a part of the watermelon flavoring. If you get it you'll know what I mean. None of the other Sour Power belts have this taste, it literally tastes like plastic and watermelon perfume compressed themselves into a belt and rolled in Sour Power powder.<br /><br />I love Sour Power as much as everyone, but next time I buy a HUGE tub (probably quite soon), it'll be of any other flavor."
1,"Let me preface this by saying that this is NOT peppermint oil even though it comes up if you search on the phrase ""peppermint oil"".<br /><br />I make peppermint bark every year for Xmas and I usually get peppermint oil for it because some non-oil based extracts can cause the melted chocolate to seize up. However, I had decided to make peppermint bark fudge this year so the fact that it's not oil isn't a big factor.<br /><br />The flavour is quite strong and you won't have to use much to get a good peppermint flavour.<br /><br />I highly recommend it as a flavouring, but if you're making chocolate candy and don't have much experience, I would suggest you find actual peppermint oil if you don't want to risk seizing."
1,"I have had a hard time finding really good decaf.  (Or good at all for that matter, especially flavored.) I stumbled across this company while searching and tried them out a while ago and fell in love.  I cannot say enough about this company and the coffee.  Excellent customer service and the coffee is great.  I just keep coming back.  I highly recommend this company and their coffee.  The maple coffee is great.  I would recommend trying many flavors as I have found them to be excellent!!"
1,"This small delicious mouthwatering box of chocolate made a strong impression on its recipient, whom i sent it as a gift. The superb taste and beautiful packaging makes it a well rounded affordable item which i would highly recommend to all. Its freshness and soft scrumptious cream makes its taste a special chocolate creamy combo for all chocoholics."
1,Does not state in any of your ads how many cans you get. Please clarify.
0,"Really need to know how many cans also, as the other reviewer<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QSN1ZW"">Friskies Whitefish and Tuna Buffet Canned Cat Food</a>  Thanks"
1,"I first purchased these root beer drops from a local candy store.  It has since gone out of business.  I was pleased that there were available from Amazon.  They are simple a root beer drop, no additions, no wrappers just pure pleasure.  To be taken of course in moderation.<br /><br />John R. Simmons<br />Sebastopol, California"
1,"I tried this after trying (and loving) the Tea's Etc Organic Coconut-Almond add-on.  This is a very good tea. It's a little mild for my tastes, as I was expecting the tea and ginger to have bolder flavors. (I'm not astute enough about tea to know if this is a blend issue or a freshness issue. Given the strong aroma I suspect the former.) That said, I really do enjoy it and just find myself using a pinch more and letting it seep longer to achieved the desired outcome. The aroma is wonderful and I think this is a perfect afternoon tea. (Who doesn't feel more energized after getting a whiff of citrus?!). The fact that the flavor isn't overpowering also makes it a good choice for folks who want to ease into drinking green tea. I'll order this again, but it will be awhile.  These ""small"" 3-oz packages last an impressively long time even with daily consumption!<br /><br />Update 9//11/12:  I paid $8.62 for this item.  I see it's now selling for less than $2..."
1,"I thought it would taste similar to 7-UP, but it's really better or at least different enough so that it has its own flavor. I like the Key Lime  better then lime, or at least it's a new flavor to me in a soda.<br />All in all; a top of the line Key Lime soda."
1,"Far superior to the vending machines available to night shift. Add some chapati, or wholewheat tortillas, and you have a filling, tasty, light meal. Price is o.k. too."
1,"If you are craving grapes, but didn't have a chance to go out to the market to get them, these Great Grape Fruit Leathers, from Stretch Island, make a great substitute.  They are packed with great, natural fruit concentrate, and are then blended, pressed, and dried into an agreeable rectangular shape.  This fruit leather is perfect for sack lunches, long hikes in the mountains or just snacking!"
1,"This is a very tasty product. I love the idea of all natural, and the flavor is outstanding.  I had a little trouble with the texture, but it certainly is leathery!  My little neice loved them, and healthy to. Very good."
1,"This is a delicious item that you can always keep in your bag. It won't go bad, it won't take up space, it's quick and healthy energy"
0,"Forgive the Scripture reference, but I am a professor of New Testament and Early Christian Origins. :) John's experience of eating the scroll was mine drinking this coffee: in my mouth it was sweet as honey, but my stomach became embittered. And I have a very strong stomach. It's a fine tasting drink, but I have tried it on several occasions over the course of two months to be sure and every time I end up feeling sick. Obviously this is not the effect for the majority of drinkers, but I would have wanted to have been warned myself before buying it."
1,"the whole office seems to favor this coffee, enough flavor to make it stand out from regular but not overpowering"
1,"These are very pricey considering you can get the Jordon Almonds at the supermarket for a few bucks, however the quality of the nut, the coating as well as the variety of shades this company offers is of the highest quality.  I ordered it to make favor bags for the adults attending a dinosaur themed party for my son's 1st birthday.  They were great... whatever was left of them... as we couldn't stop popping them as we were packing them!<br /><br />Great product and arrives in a beautiful box with ribbons, great to give to a cook or avid chef as a gift.  Great housewarming gift as well since they bring luck, prosperity and all that good stuff :)"
1,"I like to try different coffees and switch it up a lot from one month to another, and I was on a Gevalia kick.  I fell in love with this particular roast and will buy again...when Gevalia ""month"" comes back into season for me."
1,"Tried this  coffee for the first time & found it has surprised me.  Brewed it with my drip coffee maker and it makes a bold, smooth cup of coffee.  Definitely would recommend it!"
1,"I've wanted to try Gevalia for a while, but I haven't had the opportunity until recently, when I found it at a local Meijer. The coffee itself is mellow, not pungent like most espresso, but it still packs a decent kick. I definitely prefer it to the other locally available brands that are already ground (Bustelo and company.) My only complaints are that the ground seems a little coarse for espresso (although you wouldn't know it after brewing, the crema is excellent!), and that there isn't a whole bean version, which would be a very nice addition for espresso lovers. I also think that the Amazon page for this product could use a little more flair, it's a bit uninformative!"
1,My mother had just gotten out of the hospital so I sent this to cheer her up and boy did it work.  She loved it!  She is a retired nurse so the doctor's kit was just the thing to put a smile on her face and the treats lifted her spirit.
1,Great gift. Fast delivery. Quality product.
0,"I ordered this for a custodian at the high school I teach at, she was still working while on the wait-list for a liver transplant.  It was so cute, and I knew it would really be a pick-me-up for her.  It was supposed to arrive in ten business days, but never came at all, not while she was still working, or even after she got worse and was home bound waiting.  I know this is true, because I didn't know her home address, so I told them to deliver it to the school....so I know it never came.  I have e-mailed the company several times, and they have never replied, although they still spam me with info on new items...as if I would ever order from them again.  Buyer beware - the company I bought mine from was a total rip-off!"
1,"I sent this to a sick friend and she really appreciated it(not that she would've told me if she hated it).  It's thoughtful, as any gift basket is, but also cute, and perfect for the get-well scenario.  Hey, if you're going to be sick, you might as well get presents, right?"
1,Within a week..I recieved my order...food and snacks are fresh. Very good quality. Nothing stale. Great for gifts and it is worth it. My finance' loved it.
1,"I really enjoyed this product. It was delicious. Even the candy floss came in good condition which was a suprise. They glue everything in place, which is a bit annoying when you are trying to take out an item and it breaks and sticks to everything, but at least it keeps everything in place during shipping. Overall an excellent product."
0,"For $40.00 - $50.00 save your $$$<br /><br />it's okay, but really take 5 minutes and go to your local CVS, Rite Aide, etc - and put something together.<br /><br />It's just my opinion -"
1,Nice and chunky with real peanut flavor. Use this in place of smooth peanut butter in your next batch of cookies. A real treat.
1,Very pleased with my Jif Extra Crunchy Peanut Butter.  This is great for baking Peanut Butter Cookies.  There are so many crisp and fresh peanuts in every cookie.  My family just loves baking day.
1,Jif Extra Crunchy Peanut butter is the best tasting buy far. We have tried many brands and have settled on this one as our favorite. We like the big chuncks of peanuts and just like to just eat it by the spoonfull as a snack. Yum!
1,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KU2TZ8"">JIF Extra Crunchy Peanut Butter 40 oz Jar (2 Pack)</a> I got hooked on Jif decades ago. I have tried many others,but I still rate this tops. The only bad thing I can say about my last order, is that it arrived with one of the plastic jars, and its top broken. I think that is was dropped on the warehouse floor before boxing. I wanted the product NOW, so one was opened and enjoyed while one went into the trash. That ended up being the most expensive peanut butter ever bought. I just savored what I had."
1,"I used this to make a sugar-free pie for a diabetic co-worker. I mixed it with ice water and non-fat powdered milk. It was low-fat and low-carb and everyone loved it.<br /><br />I'm watching my calories so I previously had bought the Sans Sucre Chocolate Cheesecake Mousse. It was OK, but this is MUCH better."
1,"Cheddar and pretzel just go together. This bag of Goldfish is definitely the best of the Mix-Ups, and I truly think they're the best flavorway of the snack that I've probably tasted."
1,"This is my new favorite salad dressing. I went to an upscale Italian restaurant and fell in love with their homemade house dressing. In fact, I had to go there twice in a two day period just because I found myself craving the dressing.<br /><br />I went to the grocery store in search of a a similar dressing and scored a home run with this one. I'm not sure if the restaurants house dressing was better, or this one, but this one is really good.<br /><br />I like to marinate chicken in it, top a green salad with olives, tomato, and cucumbers, or even just drizzle it over a stuffed pita sandwich. I also like to finely dice carrots, cucumbers, green peppers, and tomatoes and top it with this dressing for a quick salad or healthy topping after marinating in the refrigerator for a couple of hours. It's also good for dipping grilled chicken breast strips.<br /><br />The calories are low on this dressing at only 60 calories per serving. Unlike thick dressings like ranch or honey mustard, this one really does only require the suggested serving of two tablespoons since it's thinner and coats everything very well.<br /><br />Diabetics will be glad to know there is only one gram of sugar per serving, and it also has no trans fats.<br /><br />For an Italian salad dressing, this is my top pick."
1,These are good garbanzo beans.  Just your basic canned beans.  I ordered them from Amazon to have for summer salads and had them delivered to my door without having to haul them home from the supermarket.
1,"When I cook a beef roast, I add several mixed packages of this brown gravy afterwards when I transfer the roast to a pyrex glass bowl, serve and keep leftover in fridge covered with blue lid."
1,"So many soup and stew recipes I use call for bay leaves--they add such a subtle taste nuance. But I'm overwhelmed by the price for a small jar at the grocery store. I bought this .62 oz bottle online and saved a bundle without sacrificing quality. Thanx, Amazon and McCormick's!"
1,"Dassant Vanilla Scone Mix is the best scone mix I have ever used.......It is a basic mix and can be used by adding other ingredients, ie, raisins, choc chips, dried fruit----I like to top it with an almond drizzle-----it is always a winner---this product cannot be duplicated nor beaten---it is #1, in the scone department."
1,"Gave these for gifts to three people recently and all three raved about how good and authentic these tasted and how nice the packaging was (gourmet looking apparently).  Haven't had any myself but got the suggestion from another friend who regularly puts a scone package, a coffee cup, a good paperback and some coffee beans in a gift bag."
1,I love this scone mix! My family is from the U.K. and I thought I would never find anything as good as mums scones...but now I have! I first purchased this at a henrys/sprouts (grocerie store) and then it was  no longer carried. So now I stock up here on amazon! Served these at a party and gave a box to each guest and everyone has said how EASY they are to make. Really splendid! I plan to buy them again!
1,Everything Dassant makes is delicious...in under 30 minutes you can make scones plain or with all kinds of fruit added.  Terrific hot out of the oven with a cup of coffee on a Saturday Morning.
1,"I received a box of this mix for Christmas and just now made the scones, thinking, ""um, scones?  I've never been overly impressed with them...""  I have to admit that these were absolutely delicious!  I'm not a baker but these were very easy to make, once I got the hang of flouring my work surface.  I ate two of the eight right out of the oven, and it was all I could do to save the rest for another breakfast.  Yum!"
1,"when I made these scones they have a hint of vanilla,my family really likes vanilla so i added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla flavoring,also made a slight ""dent"" in top of scone befor baking and added just a littles strawberry jam.the results were a mouth watering delious scone,very moist ,very good taste,will buy again."
1,"Okay, I'm exaggerating.  But, in all seriousness, this is a great snack product!  These little rectangular leather snacks are great.  ""Wild Apple"" has cinnamony undertones and just enough bite to make you purse your lips in joy.  You can taste the squeeze of lemon juice that they added for tanginess.....very nice."
1,Stretch Island makes the best fruit leathers ever!!All natural product with great flavors.  Quick shipping is a definite plus!
1,Mt Terriers love these and it's a good way for them to have a healthy snack.
0,"From reading the title of the product I was under the impression it was 2 twin packs,<br />meaning 4 jars. It is not which makes this a horrible buy at $25.  I have no issue with JIF it is a great peanut butter."
1,This product arrived on time and everything was intact. I highly recommend this merchant to anybody shopping at Amazon.Com
1,jif peanut taste great it has a good peanut taste to it i like a lot i use everyday of the week
1,"Quick filler-up if your on the go when your in a hurry to be some where, just open, slab and eat... BAM!!"
1,"Both my wife and I like peanut butter! But like in most things we have a different opinion. I love the extra crunchy style while she likes the creamy style. They both have that great Jif® taste and they are a good source of protein and fiber. Jif® is the top brand out there and the make a very tasty product.<br /><br />We like it on toast or crackers for a snack or for breakfast. We still even like PB&J sandwiches for a fast meal. If you like peanut butter, you'll love Jif®."
0,Love Jif Peanut Butter and placed an order through Amazon for the 2 48oz jars for $19.00 then visited my local Walmart and found 2 40oz jars for $9.24.  I like the concept of buying through Amazon with no shipping and no tax.  But I got taken on this order.
0,"You can buy this product at costco for 6.00 and that will get you two 48 oz jars, you do the math 9.00 a jar or 3.00 ajar.  Duh 40oz or48oz"
1,"It is Jiff, what can I say?  What is great is that I can send this to an APO address for my contractor spouse in Afghanistan and satisfy his peanut butter cravings postage free!"
0,Same exact product is available at Sams Club for $8.77. Wow! My Prime Membership is really paying off on this product...
1,"If you don't like peanut butter, then why are you even looking at this item?<br /><br />Peanut Butter is delicious, and if you need 96 ounces of it at once, this is the best way to get it. Of course, I prefer Chunky, and maybe you do too, but if you need 96 ounces of Creamy peanut butter, you're at the right place.<br /><br />I looked for 96 ounces elsewhere, and though I was able to locate it, I was not able to find it for a better price. Thanks to Amazon Prime, I got this 96 ounces of creamy peanut butter shipped to me in two days for free. Perfect for peanut butter shortage emergencies."
1,"My mum and her brother absolutely love this peanut butter, and they have since gotten other family members hooked as well.  So even tho you can get the same for cheaper, for me its worth the price when I'm letting them know I'm thinking of them when I'm so far away.<br /><br />Personally I'm not a peanut butter fan, so I can not give any details in that area, but considering how quickly other family members get hooked I guess its pretty good flavor wise.  The product ships quickly and I havent had any complaints about how it arrives  :-)"

1,"Whether or not it's right for you is up to you and your pediatrician to decide. We began adding it to our son's formula at 2 months because of health related issues. We currently use 1 scoop (scoop from Gerber formula can) of rice to 2 scoops of formula, and 4-5 oz of water. It mixes exceptionally well and is not ""goopy"" nor does it leave ""rice-sludge"" at the bottom of the bottle after feeding.<br />We love this, and buy it over the box cereal every time now. Even our daycare has commented on how much they like this over the traditional flakes of rice cereal. The can fits better in the pantry than the box, and is much cleaner since it isn't leaking flakes from the corners and the fold down spout. The cans stack easily, and are the same size and shape as Gerber's formula cans.<br />We initially purchased this from my wife's work, and when they ran out we switched back to box rice. It's cheaper from Amazon than it is at the local grocery stores. We're switching back to the can.<br /><br />Pros<br />-It contains DHA to boost development.<br />-Dissolves better; its more of a powder than the flakes you get in the box of Gerber rice cereal.<br />-Because it dissolves better it is easier for the infant to drink, and easier to clean the bottle after feeding (large undissolved flakes don't clog the bottle).<br />-Packaging is much cleaner than the boxes of rice cereal available from Gerber.<br /><br />Cons<br />-It's not Vegan (if you care, I don't, but some other posters obviously do).<br />-It does not come with a scoop. This is only a very minor inconvenience, as we, like the other poster, used the scoop from the can of Gerber formula that we use.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product."
1,"Very good deal when Subscribe and Save which we have delivered every 1-2 months.<br /><br />Oatmeal DHA Cereal is not easy to find. Not available in most stores like Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, Target, etc.  I don't know why they carry the DHA Rice, but not the DHA Oatmeal Cereal.<br /><br />Oatmeal Cereal my son eats mixed with breast milk and has no constipation issues like he had with the Rice.  He started this cereal at 4 months old.  Now he's 11 months.  Really enjoys eating this still.<br /><br />The 8 ounce canisters are better packed than box cereal I've opened.  I will definitely keep feeding him this."
1,"This is a great additive to my daughters formula.  It keeps her filled up more than formula alone.  The can is very handy, only wish they had included a scoop.  I just use the scoop from the formula can and it works great too.  This is much easier to measure and a lot less messy than the box rice and oatmeal cereals!"
1,"My son loves this oatmeal, and we go through it so quickly that I'm glad to be able to order it in a pack of six canisters. I've previously bought this same product in boxes, and the canister design works so much better than the boxes. With the boxes, I always felt that I was having to throw away the last several tablespoons, because the packaging was so poorly designed. The canisters work well, and they can double as a cheap toy when the oatmeal is gone.<br /><br />The taste seems to be good (though I often add some cinnamon for good measure), and I'm glad to know my son is getting DHA in his regular diet. Those with food allergy concerns should be aware that this product contains B Lactis cultures."
1,"love the cereal and on our packages, we bought 5 cases and there was some issue with the expired date (only 3 months).  when i contact Amazon team they got our issue resolve in less then 3 hours.  GREAT JOB, Amazon."
1,"I love this oatmeal, and so do my kids, but recently its been harder to find.  Wal-mart in all their infinate wisdom removed it from their shelves at our local store when they did their last store makeover.  You can get it at Target, if they have it on the shelves.  Since I found it on Amazon I just buy it by the case.  My 1 and 2 year olds both love it for breakfast and I think its way better for them than regular oatmeal.  I hope amazon never stops carring it. :)"
1,"Of course, it is nice that this cereal is in a canister (so there is less mess), but I also love knowing my son is getting DHA. We used this cereal exclusively with my 2 1/2 year old when she was a baby."
0,"Seriously, how does a baby cereal touted as a good choice as a first baby food contain these big NO-NO ingredients?! How can it be labeled as ""single grain""? There's no reason ""oat flour"" should contain wheat... I bought this thinking I could avoid supplementing with probiotics & dha... should have read more closely before purchasing.. Forget it, I'm going back to simply grinding up my own oatmeal.. sick of over paying for 'baby' cereal anyways..."
1,I feed it because I know its good for them. If they dont eat it due to taste it may be the texture. My daughter loves it and cant drink her bottle without it. We were forced to give her rice in her bottle because she has such had acid reflux but every since we changed her formula and gave her this she does great!
1,"I use a small amount in my formula for my 8 week old son. He always woke up VERY VERY hungry and it really wares everyone down. So I did some research and tested it out and it worked!!!! 8-10 straight hours of sleep for everyone. You have to be very careful on how much you put in since it can cause constipation and make hard poops. Once we got the right nipples and measurements everything was a big relief! Also, don't use it for every feed. I only use it midday and that's it. I have no worries of him choking because it blends very well. I don't shake my formulas I use a chop stick and swirl it around till its blended completely, it really helps with reducing bubbles."
1,This is the first and only baby cereal that I have tried and I have no reason to try any other kind. My doctor recommended mixing baby apple juice with the cereal to make it taste better. My son after 2 days eats all the cereal in his bowl. Wonderful product and so nice that I can buy in bulk since we go through it so fast.
1,"I believe it's good for my child. Though he does not like it very much, he still accept it. However I believe oat is a kind of good food."
1,"I have been giving this rice cereal to my now 10 month old daughter since she was 6 months old! She loves it! She loves it plain. I did buy Happy Belly brown rice cereal but she doesn't like it. Also Gerber mixes really smooth, Happy Belly is very lumpy when mixed. I will be buying this again!"
1,"This is the first and only rice cereal I ever used(because I don't know any others),my baby like it never had any problem,Pls it has DHA and its oatmeal."
1,I have used this oatmeal with all three of my children and they love it. I am glad Amazon sells it because our local Walmart stopped carrying it. Thanks Amazon :)
0,"I gave this to my baby thinking the DHA and probiotic aspects were a plus. In theory, they are.<br /><br />We originally started with another brand's organic rice cereal. It listed only a few ingredients: Rice, Rice Bran Extract, Tocopherols (Vitamin E), alpha-Amylase (Enzyme), Electrolytic Iron. Gerber's DHA/Probiotic rice cereal has a very long ingredient list, I think because of all of the vitamins it is fortified with. Well, that is fine. Wish it were more basic, but ok.<br /><br />My son loves ""normal"" rice cereal. With this DHA rice cereal, he will tolerate it, but he definitely noticed the difference. He kind of scrunches up his face. Today his made a gagging face and acted like he was going to throw it up. I don't know if that is because he doesn't like the weird flavor or what.  I tasted it too, and I can't stand the fishy sense I get when I eat it. It isn't a strong or overpowering fishy flavor, but there is definitely a weird aftertaste going on. You can still notice it when you mix in fruit or sweet potatoes to try and cover it up.<br /><br />I don't think I will finish the can we started. Back to the other brand for us. Bummer, Gerber. Wish they could use algae based DHA rather than Tuna oil."
1,"I bought several case of it, thinking my little baby girl will like it.  Nope, she does not like it mixed with water or milk.  It does not mix well with soup.  Since it has a mild sweet taste to it, it will ruin the flavor of the soup.  She is picky, what can I say.<br /><br />Finally, after many tries, we finally figured out a way to feed her the cereal:  mix the cereal with formula/milk; pour into a pan and warm it up on the stove; while heating it up, stir constantly to ensure they are mixed together; once well mixed, let it cool and then pour into bottle to feed.  I had to cut the silicone nipple in order to accommodate the thick liquid.<br /><br />We feed her this mix once or twice daily.  As she grows, formula/milk alone do not last as long as they used to.  To keep her stomach content, night time feeding is essential, so she does not awake from hunger in the middle of the night.  A bit of work, but I think it is worth it."
0,I switched from the box cereal to this particular kind thinking it was better and it made my son have diarrhea!!!!  I'm switching back to the box cereal.
0,"Unfortunately, Gerber is using tuna oil as a source of DHA. This is very bad for the environment - tuna is severely over-fished and people should not really be eating tuna at all. They should switch to a plant- or algae-based source of DHA. Until then, I suggest that you avoid this product if you care about the environment. By the way, a fish-based source of DHA does have a higher chance of being contaminated by toxic chemicals like mercury. This is one of the reasons why people seeking higher DHA levels in their diet have switched to plant-based sources such as flaxseed oil."
0,"My baby really did not like eating this. I got this for the DHA thinking it would be so refined it wouldn't taste fishy. Well, my son usually takes regular rice cereal fine. I fed him this and at first he would gag and most if it came right back out. I tasted it and holy crap is it gross. It definitely has essence of fish. I tried his other rice cereal before too. It was just bland, rice cereal. This was just disgusting. Although, it might not be the taste that's making him gag. This stuff has a seriously weird texture. It must be the gelatin. It was really frustrating to me to mix up. I'd get it to what I thought was a good consistency and a few minutes later it would turn into this runny mess, sort of like paste. Awful! I threw the rest of the can away and went back to the regular stuff."
0,As a previous reader commented this product does have gelatin in it.  I called and Gerber said the source of the gelatin is pork.
0,"My sweet 6 month old might have food allergies - he's thrown this up about three times now (last time I'll try with this.) He's been exclusively breastfed until now, and I've introduced sweet potato, pears, applesauce, squash, carrots and mixed veggies with no drama. I've noticed that this ceral not only contains rice, but soy, tuna, and pork-based gelatin. Going to a pediatric allergist tomorrow to check out what's going on. Poor baby! Would love to hear if anyone else has a similar story."
1,Arrived in a vacuum pac foil pouch.  An excellant price at six bucks for one pound--much better than the grocery store.
1,"Frontier product has always been reliable.  The bag of turmeric had a small tear in the side of the bag and the supplier put a piece of scotch tape over the tear to keep it from leaking, which I was a bit skeptic about.  All in all the turmeric is working well.  I am putting it in capsules and using it for pain."
1,"Came exactly as described.  It's great that it's in a dark metallic bag, but a reseal zip-top type would have been a really good help.  Would absolutely buy from this seller again."
0,"The product was advertised as resealable jars but was actually cans. The slices were mushy/soft. Its difficult to store the product once the cans are opened. The product quality,in general, is poor."
1,"the noodles are super al dente and bouncy, unlike any instant noodle I've ever had. Comes pretty close to real noodle soup actually. The soup base is similar to the original horuruk. Not the best ramyun I've ever had, but certainly not too shabby either."
0,"Apparently there is a second version of this, as evidenced by the ""2"", as in ""React 2"".  The 2 version is pretty bad compared to the non-2 version, IMO.  5... what a horrible idea."
0,"As of today January 26th 2012, the description says (pack of 20) this is incorrect. Currently the unit price comes down to 1.36 a pack. Probably more expensive than the local grocery stores value 3 pack of 2.99"
1,"Until I discovered this case product on Amazon, I had been buying the ""Taste of Thai"" brand coconut milk at my local grocery for more than $2 per can. This is just over $1 per can, which is amazing. The quality of the milk is equal to the more expensive brand and the nutrition information is comparable, meaning that it hasn't been watered down to produce more milk (some brand do this).<br />Cooked well and came out in a homogenized milk form rather than a clump of milk fat followed by coconut water. I am very pleased."
0,"Since Amazon doesn't list the ingredients, here they are: coconut milk, water, sodium metabisulfite, polysorbate 60, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and guar gum. That alone speaks volumes to me."
1,"Not quite as thick and flavorful as regular coconut milk, but soooo much more healthy that it's worth it to me. With regular, I only want to use a little bit in recipes and make the recipes less frequently. With this lite, I feel free to indulge in those recipes that benefit from coconut milk."
1,Delivered as promised. It's coconut milk. I can't say it's any different that other types. I just liked that it was Lite and the price was right :)
1,I use this when cooking a variety of dishes like Thai curries.  I haven't tried the non-lite variety but I don't feel like I'm being deprived by this 'lite' product.  Easy to use and has a good flavor.
1,"I tried a couple different brands; one being Thai Kitchen which is very, very thick (really good, but hard to get out of the can at times).  I wanted a lighter brand which would actually pour out of the can more easily.  I ordered this case and I am pleased with the taste (not as flavorful, but still very good)and thickness. I'll be stocked for a while...I may just give some to family.  I am quite happy with my purchase.  I have been using this in my coffee for a healthier change."
0,"I ordered this product believing it was a good product at a great price.<br /><br />The package arrived just now via UPS. The box had been torn open and was barely being held together at the bottom by a half removed strip of packing tape. Almost all of the cans were damaged, from a single dent to a can that was nearly crushed in two.<br /><br /> I  and most consumers do not use dented cans of food or food products. I can't rate the quality of the product because I will not jeopardize my health and safety and that of my family by opening one and ingesting the contents.<br /><br />The entire case is a total loss and as it is not accepted for returns I have to just kiss my money good bye.<br /><br />I am disappointed with Amazon, it was packaged by Amazon in one of their boxes, and they won't allow me to recoup any of my loss.<br /><br />I am out $27.10 and no one is liable. BUYER BEWARE!"
1,Been using this product for over a year. Excellent. My cat thinks so too.
1,"Best kind of dog food I've ever used - the only kind that my dogs can eat without having ""allergies"" i.e. itchy skin and coat.  Supreme!  Reccommended for anyone tryign to give their pet a longer, healthier life."
1,My Dalmatian mix has severe skin allergies. This food has helped reduce her problems by about 50%. Fewer visits to the vet and less scratching at home.<br /><br />I have been using Wysong products for about 5 years. They make a quality product at a reasonable price.
1,"This kibble has been the staple diet of my 80 lb Great Dane Mix (named Kobe) for the past year. He came to me two years ago from a rescue group who transports black dogs from the southern U.S, where black dogs have a very high kill rate, to the nortern U.S. to be adopted. He was about 5 yrs old at the time I adopted him, sight unseen, from Arkansas.  Severe alleries were included among the miriad of issues that afflicted him. This manifested itself in runny eyes, full body skin yeast infection resulting in what the vet termed ""elephant skin"" on his abdomen, throat, elbows, and haunches.  Also bald spots over his neck, throat, thighs, and toes from constant scratching and biting at himself. In many places the ""elepant skin"" was perpetually split/cracked, infected, and bleeding.  After treating the bacterial and yeast infections with both topical and oral agents which did clear up the bacteria but left the yeast as a chronic secondary infection of the allergies, I searched for other remedies.  Along with seasonal, environmental, and other allergies to dust, fabrics, vegitation, etc. I also found a lot of good information about food allergies.<br />Taking this information into consideration I scouted around for an ""allergenic"" kibble that was made by a company that has never had a recall, does not do animal testing, provides appropriate nutrition, and is somewhat affordable. Wysong seemed to fit the bill. Anergen has been a key part of Kobe's allergy treatment program for the past year.  Along with ""therapeutic baths"", Ketokonazole lotions, hydrocortisone lotions, diligent laundering of doggie coats/bedding/linens (no wool), and oral antihistamines Kobe's skin is soft and smooth without splits/cracks/infection; his bald spots have shrunk to half the size; and his eyes only run occasionally.  He still does scratch and bite at himself intermittently. I notice this usually happens when I deviate from the Anergen diet, giving him rawhide chews, beef bones with marrow, or cookies (organic) with mixed ingredients.<br />I don't really know what else, short of steroids, can be done to help him. I have avoided steroids due to their own detrimental health effects. Anergen seems to be the food solution to his allergies, which is a good thing! I add water to the kibble and let it sit about 10 minutes to form a kind of ""gravy"".  He likes this better than the straight dry kibble and it also helps to keep him hydrated.<br />Note: My other dog, a 9yr old husky-shepard mix eats Wysong Maintenance and is strong and svelt; and the cats eat Wysong Uretic."
1,"Okay, so my cat doesn't like this alone BUT when I mix it with her other food it stops her from overeating/eating too fast and vomiting her food.  I'm all for it because of that.  No more messes on the floor after she eats too fast."
0,Cat hates this as she will not even go near it.  I wish I did not buy 36lbs of this but oh well.
1,"I have been using these herbs on everything.  They are especially flavorful on roasted veggies and meats. This is also a great value.  You get 8 oz. which, I am sure I would not even be able to use up in 1 year."
1,"my daughter loves squeeze applesauces, but I would like her to get more variety in her diet. These are great - she loves them just as much!"
1,"My daughter doesn't eat very much food in one sitting - she eats healthy (so she isn't super picky, just doesn't eat a lot).  This flavor has been the one thing that she will almost always eat the whole pouch of in one go.  I tasted it and think it's good too!"
1,"My little one was not so keen on fresh fruit right off the bat, so these came in handy.  My son got tired of the spoon you attach so he just sucks them right down.  I keep some on hand now for outings so he doesn't end up eating junk (fries, chips, etc).<br /><br />They are also great to mix with yogurt, or even milk, when ready.  Plus it is a great way to get organic fruits, especially if your local store doesn't have a great selection, like mine."
1,"I bought several different flavors from Plum Organic in the pouch.  I really like this product.  You can screw the lid back on if you only give a portion of it to your baby and put it back in the fridge for later.  The lid seals it back up, I used to do this when my baby was younger and I didn't want her to eat a whole pouch in one meal.  But now, she is older and I can hand her the whole pouch to snack on.  She is able to get the food out with a good flow, not to fast that she is stuffing her face, but not so slow that she gets frustrated.  She is 14months old and can hold it and suck it out on her own.  There is also no mess, or no mess at least with my baby.  She hasn't spilled a drop.  I also like the ingredients for this product and feel like I am giving her a healthy fruit snack."
1,These are so good that I would eat one. My baby is only 9 months but some of the baby food pouches are so watery and she likes to hold on to them and drink it so I got these hoping they would be a little thicker and they are but not too thick. She loves them and they were a really good price with s&s.
1,"These are portable, fruit only, and they are incentive for my daughter to finish her meal before getting one -- she sucks it right down.  Also, my husband is a dentist so of course she isn't allowed to have any juice, so this fits the bill."
1,"This coffee cake is so good, it was worth it to me to pay the extra money.  It's not available in supermarkets in my state, othewise it would have been a 50 percent savings-but really it is so moist and flavorful it is worth it at any price!"
1,"So good that the cakes did not last until Christmas.  The balance of flavors was just right -- not to sweet, not too much cinnamon, and nice a gooey on top."
1,Pleased with these nuts. Went through them fast and even shared some with friends. Keep them in the fridge or freezer to lengthen shelf-life.
1,This is the ultimate in fudge!  well worth the price. Gave my neighbor part of my order and they were just as impressed with the quality of this fudge!
1,Another great product from Eden Foods.  This is made in Japan and only has 3 ingredients without any artificial yellow food coloring.  I didn't find it overly salty (I just rinsed with water before slicing).  They are perfect in Japanese or Korean style nori rolls.
0,I was excited for this but disappointed when I got it. It's salty (very salty) unlike the sweeter ones from Japanese restaurants. The outside is also a thick texture that I had to remove. It wasn't as crunchy as it should be.
0,"Even after I washed and soaked them in water for a long time, still too salty! Not good."
0,these edible diamonds did not look shiny like the pictures shown they looked more like molded jello. I would not recommend this product if you want the diamonds to look real.
1,"These chips are great-they're crispy, crunchy, and have lots of flavor. Many times, gluten-free is taste-free, but not this time. We served to guests one night and several wanted to know what brand, etc.  You will not be disappointed.  They came well packed--nothing was crushed or broken."
1,"These are delicious! This particular item was for the miniature bars, which are cute and great for gifting or stuffing stockings."
1,"Unfortunately we can't get this product locally anymore and questions sent to Old El Paso's corporate headquarters indicates that they've really got no idea how their distribution channels work -- they can't even tell you if their products are sold in all of Los Angeles County.. Go figure.. Anyway, if I can get it here, I'm happy!  I've tried a bunch of other sauces (La Victoria, El Pato, and a few other off brands) and the others are always too hot (for the rest of the family).. I find the Old El Paso to have the proper amount of mild heat and the great flavor.. I could eat the stuff every day!"
1,"All the enchilada sauces for Old El Paso are really tasty. Unfortunately they have both soy and gluten, which makes them off limits for a lot of people with food sensitivities (lost stars for that). But taste-wise, for everybody else, they are really good! The red sauce comes in hot, medium, and mild, and unlike some 'hot' sauces it doesn't sacrifice taste at all for the heat. The green sauce is very mild. My kid and friends love enchiladas made with either. I eat lowcarb, and often chop up cooked chicken, dice a little pepper/onion, and mix in a little enchilada sauce (sometimes a little cream cheese) and nuke it and stir. Yum."
1,"after expressing my dissapointment when receiving a basket that I ordered, I received a personal email from a very kind employee expressing how sorry they were about my situation. I received full credit back, and am now aware that with fundrasiers I can get a 20%,discount.  I am truly thankful for their concern."
1,"The recipient moved into a new home and the company sent this gift basket!  The recipient loved it!<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000E6NMH"">Settling In: Housewarming Gift Basket</a>"
1,"Not only do I own a business that makes animal accessories/treats, but I also volunteer and donate things to a local non profit no kill animal shelter.  Overall, I love this product as you can make dog treats and not worry about them melting or getting messed up before selling them or before the customer gets them home.  Yes, the dogs don't care what the treats look like, they only care about taste, and most things are tasty to them.  However, for someone who loves to make donated treats, this is a little expensive.  Not that I can find it anywhere cheaper than here, but just overall, a little more.  Just makes for having to charge a little bit more for the product you sell."
1,This is the best dessert ever and so easy to make.  Great for all ages.  Tastes like real peanut butter.
1,"Wow!  This was a surprise.  While the other reviews tempted me to try it... and i figured my kids would love it (anything with chocolate and peanutbutter is a winner)... i was mightily surprised to find that all the adults ate it before the kids could get any.<br /><br />Very easy to prepare and a quick, light (if you leave off the topping and the crust) dessert that goes great after a pork meal.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for offering it!  i HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who enjoys a reeses cup."
1,"Bought this due to tempting reviews.  It is good but I find a little bit goes a long way as it is very rich.  In fact, our favorite way to have it is frozen and in small quantities.  We think of it more like candy when eaten this way but find a small piece is all we need at any one sitting.  A nice ""treat"" after dinner to satisfy one's sweet tooth."
1,My family loves this. It was always a crowd pleaser at school functions. It is so easy to make. I too can not find this on the shelves anymore. I sure wish Amazon would ship to Alaska. We really miss this dessert.
1,I bought this as a treat for my husband because he loves anything with peanut butter.  This was amazingly good.  We made it into muffin cups and froze the individual servings.  It made 12 big servings for less then half the cost of one slice of peanut butter pie at my dh's favorite restaurant.  And he claims this is just as good.
1,I tryed this dessert several years ago and it was the most amazing thing I have ever had.  But sadly I never saw it on the shelves again.  I am so happy I can get it here at amazon even though it is 10 pkgs.
1,"(ASIN: B004INAQMM)  Well, here we have white fish, with Cottie's beloved cheddar cheese.  But his consumption of it is not on par with that for the tuna, not by a cat's whisker or any other measure you care to use.<br />I do not understand it.  I have fed him white fish with a myriad of other foods, including fish and shellfish, and he has usually devoured them, one and all.  But not this!  The only thing I can know for sure is that he knows it isn't tuna, which is the food he expects to experience with cheddar.<br />Cottie will eat it if very hungry, but not with the same gusto.  I need to make an attempt to find something special to put in it so he will enjoy it more than he does now.  Does anyone have any ideas for me?<br />Your takeaway is, this is a super Fancy Feast flavor, most cats will love it, but mine is a shtoonk."
1,"I first fount this Fancy Feast with Cheddar at my local grocers about six months ago. My cats loved it and I have been waiting on Amazon to bring it on board for a long time. Finally they have. ""Subscribe and Save"" here I come!<br /><br />My cats especially enjoy this Fancy Feast Cheddar with Whitefish as a base. My store had Whitefish, Chicken<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004INEW3Q"">Purina Fancy Feast Delights with Cheddar Chicken, 3-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a>, and Turkey <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004INIUPC"">Purina Fancy Feast Delights with Cheddar Turkey, 3-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a> available in their limited edition Display Case when the product first arrived. Whitefish and Chicken were equally popular with my cats, but they seem tired of Turkey and were not crazy about it. I let them try the Tuna <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004INAQLI"">Purina Fancy Feast Delights with Cheddar Tuna, 3-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a> when it arrived later. They also liked that. But Whitefish and Chicken topped the list of the things they liked in this line. They do not care for the Fancy Feast Souffles at all. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KH0NC"">Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys for Cats, White Meat Chicken & Cheddar Cheese Souffle With Garden Greens, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> I do not know if they use a different variety of cheese or what, but they do not care for those.<br /><br />So I have been giving the kittys The Cheddar Whitefish now for six months. The cats always gobble it up and show no signs of tiring of it. So, I recommend that you give your kitty's a chance to try it. They too should become Cheddar lovers. PS: I did put Cheddar Whitefish on my Subscribe and Save list and have it delivered every few months. I hope you are as pleased with it as I am. Thank You."
1,"My cat has chronic renal failure and often doesn't want to eat. He will always eat this, and while I try not to give him fish every day (or tuna ever), I will let him have a can of this 2-3 times a week if needed. It's such a treat for him and I feel better seeing him eat with gusto. Highly recommended."
1,"These capsules go with our Espresso Italia Machine.  It makes a perfect froth with milk and the capsules each make one perfect espresso and crema.  I Love my machine, with Ghiradelli flavoring makes a Fabulous cappucinno, Better the than that star....'s company."
1,I was so grateful to find these Espresso capsules on Amazon!  We have used them before but lost our supplier.  Now I won't go anywhere else - this is excellent stuff.
1,"Used both the Dark and regular espresso.  Both were very nice and the machine did a good job making a nice tasting espresso.  However, the machine lasted less than two months!  So now i'm in North Africa with a broken coffee machine and about 100 pods :-(  Replaced with another brand."
1,They beat my previous supplier by ~ $10. I use the long espresso setting to make great capuccinos.
1,"I had noticed this item show up in the grocery isles but the price was hardly a buy. Found this in the warehouse sale and thought I would try it, since the price was better than I was paying for the generic dressing. As usual Miracle Whip has a good product. It was lite and creamy and had a good taste, not like some of the generic  brands that taste oily or have no taste at all. Very good product just needs a price adjustment."
1,"There's just something about Tapioca Pudding that makes me happy.  Definitely my favorite.  Until recently, I would just buy the Kozy Shack pre packaged tapioca pudding from the grocery in the refrigerated section; however, it has risen in price to the point where it is much more economical to make the cook and serve Jell-o brand, which tastes fresher and can be served warm or cold (or frozen in an ice tray similar to pudding pops (or poppers).  Also, no more worrying about the expiration date like you do with the refrigerated ones.<br /><br />When purchased from Amazon via their promo sales, you can get a package of this for .50.  Add in the price of 2 cups of milk (another .50), and you've made 4 servings of this for $1.  Definitely a bargain!"
1,"In my family this is a must, even replaces natural tapioca! Esay to make and great for kids and adults!"
1,Product arrived as promised and timely.  It is great not having to shop several markets to find this product.  They always seem to be out of stock for one reason or another.
1,"I ordered this from Amazon after reading other reviews and I'm glad I did! The pudding is really easy to make, just add skim milk and stir on medium heat for a few minutes and you have delicious pudding ready. I let it cool for a little while longer than mentioned on the pack as this makes the pudding thicker and more tasty."
1,this is an excellent cook and serve fat free pudding that is good for those watching their weight yet tastes good enough to serve guests!
1,For the past years I used a different brand of tapioca but the process is long and tedious. My surprise is that Cook & Serve is much much faster and the taste is quite good. It can be eaten hot or cold.<br />Actually I like it cold and cover it with canned peaches. Cinnamon or bananas are good too.
1,Could not find this product in stores or Jello web site.  Amazon had it so glad they did.  This puddig taste like no other and is the best!
1,"Have you ever sat down and began eating pudding, only to find yourself in utter dismay at the fact that the entire portion could consumed without a single instance of chewing? Well now you can enjoy a rousing mastication while also savoring the delicious vanilla flavor.<br /><br />Mmmmm....tapioca pudding is rad."
1,"Get stuff just wished it were sold int our local stores.<br /><br />Ordered it one day, seems like we got it the next."
1,"Easy to make, this cook and serve is perfect for people who want tapioca quickly and don't want a lot of extra ingredients around."
1,"The front of the box boasts, ""Low Sodium - No Cholesterol - Low Fat"". ""100% Pure Roasted Whole Grain Buckwheat"". ""Wheat & Gluten Free"".<br /><br />Ingredients: ""100% pure buckwheat - contains no additives, fortifiers or preservatives.""<br />""170 calories per 1/4 cup serving. About 3/4 cup prepared.""<br /><br />Flavor? That depends on you. The directions recommend adding bouillon but a lot of bouillon just winds up being chunks of MSG. Most recently I tried adding some jamaican jerk flavoring and it worked well. You can use this as a base, throwing other ingredients, veggies, etc. to turn this into your own creation. This cooks up in maybe fifteen minutes.<br /><br />Only drawback, which may not be a nuisance to you, is that preparation as directed uses two pans, one to boil the liquid ingredients and a second to griddle up the kasha with egg coating before combining the two into one pan. That's not enough of a drawback to prevent me from stocking up on more Wolff's Kasha."
0,"For those of us buying Diet soft drinks, the sweetener used often becomes a vital piece of information. Why even bother offering diet tonic for sale if you don't tell us this? Many diet tonics are STILL made with saccharin (tastes AWFUL). We want to know BEFORE we order."
1,This is a great tasting snack with only 130 calories and 6 grams of fat in each 1 serving bag (2 cups). Kids love them and have no idea they are oven baked and all natural. It's a snack you can feel good about.
1,I love cheesy snacks that aren't entirely bad for me. I find these are convenient to bring to work.
1,"If you like cheese doodles, you'll love these. All natural and very cheesy! Love the portion control packages!"
1,these are awesome. period. my family loves them and they are the healthy alternative to other snacks so these will probably become a staple in our snack pantry!
1,While I wouldn't call this a health food they are healthier than most snack foods so I don't worry as much when my kids eat a bag of these.<br /><br />The taste is a bit more mild than Cheetos so if you are hooked on cheetos these might not do.  I know when we open a bag around here no one can stop eating them until they are gone.<br /><br />Here are the nutrition facts comparing them to Cheetos Natural White Cheddar Cheese Puffs<br /><br />  Cheetos WC  Smart Puff<br />Calories 150  130<br />Fat Calories 80  60<br />Fat  9g  6g<br />Sodium  290mg  50mg<br /><br />Not a huge difference and everything else is close.  I'm sure regular cheetos would have higher numbers.
1,"My kids LOVE these.  We are a gluten free family.  Snacks that work with our diet are hard to find.  Smart puffs are not only tasty, they also use REAL ingredients.  Perfect for a restricted diet."
1,"Robert's American Gourmet Smart Puffs are addictive and delicious! All natural, good flavor and no chemical-aftertaste--cause there are none. Guilt free snacking!"
1,"Great snack for whole family.  Everyone likes them, from the 2-year old to the teens, grandma too.  The most popular (in this house) of all the Roberts snacks."
1,"These cheese curls taste much better that biscuit company variety, being a much more enjoyable, cheesier experience.  They are preservative, guilt free, low in saturated fat, and a rather nice expiration period, so you don't have to worry much about gorging on them before they expire."
1,"Delicious, no problem w/ arriving stale. Nice size for lunches -- my kids and I like them more than cheetos. And no msg, or food coma feelings after eating them -- nice and light, satisfying."
1,"I have always loved cheese puffs but finding the perfect one was difficult.<br /><br />Cheeto's ""Dangerously Cheesy"" Cheese Puffs were disgusting. I do not think their ""cheese"" is even real cheese. I wanted something plainer and healthier for myself.<br /><br />I have tired smaller companies but they always ended getting bankrupt or discontinuing their plaining cheese puffs.<br /><br />Finally, I tried Smart Puffs from my local supermarket. I was a little skeptical; they were so cheap! When I got home and popped one in my mouth, I was so surprised each puff was lightly covered in cheese. Each puff was not completely crunchy; they sort of slowly melt in your mouth as you chew!<br /><br />I will definitely recommend anyone who looking for a healthy snack alternative this product.<br /><br />Pros:<br />A healthy snack<br />Lightly covered in cheese<br />Delicious, too!<br /><br />Cons:<br />It is so hard to put down a bag!"
1,Hello<br /><br />On sale for 62 cents a bag.  Not cheap enough for me. Why won't Amazon put some extraordinary deals out there for us parents who want to send our college kids a special goodie to share with their dorm?
1,"Yum Yum!!! I bought a case of these for a camping trip my daughter was going on with her cross country team...they LOVED them. Good flavor, texture, and a nice substitute for other cheesey flavored snacks."
1,"This is a snack that I can't find in our local markets.  I ordered a case of puffs from amazon.com on a whim.  Shoping for food online was a first for me. When this huge box arrived my wife and I couldn't believe the size of it.  We had a good laugh unpacking 24 bags of Smart Puffs and ate one bag full right away.  The puffs tasted quite good and with the reasonably healthful ingredients they contain we did not feel guilty eating them.<br /><br />The puffs have a pleasant natural cheese taste.  However, eating Gourmet Smart Puffs is a somewhat startling experience. Pop a couple of the puffs into your mouth chew a few times and it feels like a crunchy mouthful of cheesy air.  Is that strange or what?<br /><br />I think I would like a bit more substance to my snacks, but I guess one can't have it all and still remain reasonably healthy.  Smart puffs do not seem like junk food.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, your fingers do not get all yellow eating Smart Puffs.  I have ordered my second case of Robert's Smart Puffs."
1,"I was expecting the Cheetos like snacks that are in the Chaos mix (which is quite yummy), but that's not what these are.  They are thick and airy like Jax, not hard a crunchy like Cheetos.  They taste good, but if you're looking for crunchy, this isn't it.<br /><br />Does anyone know if they sell the Cheetos like stuff that's in Chaos by itself?"
1,"Its almost the same in taste as Cheetos except without the artifical coloring (these are light yellow, not orange).If you like Cheetos (puffs)you will like these and the ingredients are top notch.Not 5 stars because of the carbs;17g per serving.Otherwise ,very healthy snack and the price is fair enough though on the high end."
0,I love Pirate's booty aged white cheddar and thought these would be just as good- but was I WRONG! They are awful-no pleasant crunch-no flavor at all! I am going to try the other Pirate Booty flavors in a variety pack and hope they are not as foul as these. Don't know how they got these so wrong when the aged white cheddar is so DELICIOUS!!!
1,"I am gluten free so I am always looking to have grab and go items available.  My kids love these puffs, and so do I.<br /><br />Lots of them for a reasonable calorie count."
1,"I love these. They're cheesy, crunchy, and a relatively healthy junk food. They put cheetos to shame on all levels. I also couldn't be happier that they're gluten free. I love the individual packages; it keeps the product fresher longer and helps maintain portion control. These can be especially addictive."
1,"Awesome product...It is hard to find things with low sugar, low salt, and low fat with a great taste. This product definately fits the bill!"
0,"Pros: Low Cal. Cons: Hardly any flavor. Seriously, I taste nothing but ""puff"". They get stale fast, and the bag always tears when opening. Always! Very annoying. Sorry, if you want cheddar flavor, look elsewhere. These remind me of rice crackers."
1,"Sometimes you just have to eat something that's salty, crunchy and tastes like junk food. If you get the junk food craving, snacking on Smart Puffs Real Wisconsin Cheddar Puffs will satisfy your craving without too much guilt.<br /><br />These little gems are baked, not fried, and taste so good when popped into your mouth. Kind of salty, kind of cheesy, and just plain delicious.<br /><br />Highly recommend."
0,"Yes, I do like the taste of these cheese puffs.  Enough said about taste.  Here's the issue -->  Get a bag, look at the nutritional information and ask yourself ""How many calories are in a bag of these puffs?""  Your initial answer will likely be 140 calories as that is what is printed on the bag of ""about 1"" servings.  In actuality, the bag is 1 3/8 oz or 1.375 oz.  So, there is over 190 calories in a bag which is more that 1/3 more calories than what you observe via a fast look at the nutritional info on the bag.  I consider this devious at the very least.  Now, is that not so SMART or what??"
0,"I really hesitate to leave a negative review since we love the chips, but both of the last 2 shipments were destroyed.  Both boxes were marked ""received in damaged condition"" - from the shipper.  I've never received any other damaged products from Amazon, so I made the mistake of ordering the chips again, thinking it was a fluke. Evidently not. Will not buy these from Amazon again."
1,"I've bought everything Pirate Brands has made (except for Potato Flyers) and this one is probably the best overall. My wife and I can't stop eating these. They're simply awesome. Very cheesy, good texture, very easy to chew, no greasy/oily aftertaste or residue on your hands, just precious cheese dust! We like mixing these up with other cheese snacks (pirate booty, gold fish crackers, etc) and pretzels for a nice custom snack mix. These are sure to please anyone that likes cheese curls, just don't tell whoever you give them to that they are more healthy than normal cheese puffs and they'll never know the difference!"
1,This is a an excellent product.  No trans fat and baked in an oven; no greasy fat that it is baked in.
1,"These puffs are great to have around when you crave a crunchy, cheezy, salty snack that's not too bad for you. Only 140 Calories per bag compared to about 230 calories for similar sized Cheetos Puffs."
1,while no junk food or snack food is actually good for us...this one comes close to being satisfying for a salty snack with lots of  cheesy taste but without the strange ingredients of the other popular cheese puff brands.  I like them.  Light and they  do not upset the system with additives and colorings.  A little too addictive with all the salt but if you can be disciplined this is a good alternative when you simply must have something crunchy and salty to eat.  I would buy them again.  No orange fingers and no weird carb feeling after eating them.
1,These  were recommended by my nutritionist as a portion and calorie controlled snack. One bag is filling and satisfying!
0,"Boy was I dissapointed in these babies.  I thought that they would taste like an actually puff, but they tasted like nothing, honestly. I love pirates booty, that is my favorite and one that I am going to stick to.  These taste like a very very weark version of pirates booty, no flavor to speak of at all and not worth the money.  So I would buy a bag at a store first to try before purchasing online in a large amount.  Dont expect much flavor or anything form this snack, unless your into eating flavorless food."
1,"This is a very healthy alternative snack for my child.  It is trans fat and gluten-free, has no cholesterol, and is baked.  My son loves this as a snack.  I want the best for my 2-year old and this all natural product is a complete hit.  He loves another of this company's products, the pirate's booty.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CONMBS"">Pirate's Booty Rice & Corn Puffs, Aged White Cheddar, 4-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>"
1,These are a compomise for people who can't give up there chips.  They taste good help that craving for salt while not as bad for you as potato chips.  Just the<br />right size for a treat that doesn't leave you feeling like you need more!
1,"I tried these after having Pirate's Booty one day.  Anyway I prefer this taste over Cheetos Curls.  The taste is a little milder, but in a good way.  Besides the taste these are 10X less bad for you than Cheetos.  The only bad thing is that you can kill the bag in 2 or 3 sittings and not even realize it."
1,"For me - these are great - they're light and crunchy without the bright orage residue of others.  My baby loves these (she's not been spoiled by others kinds) and my older boys don't care for them.  they prefer other kinds of chips.  I think if you start them very young or try them later once the kids are old enough to grasp the idea of nutrition - they'll be a big hit.  I personally prefer the taste of these over other brands and other types of salty, crunchy snacks."
1,I personally love the pirate's booty but I decided to give this a try. My family loves it! The smell isn't the best but to eat a bag full of not-guilty puffs (only 130 calories! not bad for a whole bag)I would say that evens it out. I'd get it again... but I have to try the others flavors first.
1,This is tasty snack food.  Would definitely purchase again.  And it's a healthy snack!
1,"I thought these little cheese puffs were great. I don't think they are necessarily a health food, but a tasty snack."
1,My family loves smart puffs. They are a healthy alternative to cheez doodles. We have ordered several cases from Amazon. The price is right!
1,"Okay, I love my orange fingers, but if I can buy something healthier and just as good tasting THIS IS IT.<br /><br />I'm not even going to mention the absence of orange fingers. Oh wait, I just did. Taste just as good. Just as satisfying, and a bit cheaper... Hard to believe but with Free shipping you can't go wrong. These sell for a fortune at the grocery store."
1,A good product.  A nice alternative to the cheese puffs from the other brands.  They're not healthy but they make a good occasional treat.
1,These were my kids favorite.  No orange mess and a light crunchy texture.
1,"Smart Puffs are a really delicious and healthy snack. The ingredients are all  natural, the fat content is low and they are baked not fried.My kids really like these, today I am ordering my second case. Great low price too!!"
1,"Robert's Smart Puffs are not fake orange-colored like the big corporate name brands.  Very cheesy and oh so delicious.  Try them!  You won't be sorry.  But be warned, they are seriously addictive. :)"
1,"These are very tasty for all the reasons the below reviewer cited - a lot like cheetoes, but without artificial additives. I don't know why you'd cite carbs as a reason to take off a star - you sort of, you know, need them to live."
1,"Corn meal never tasted this good.<br /><br />These Smart Puffs are less salty, contain no dusty orange coloring and don't leave your hands and teeth looking like you ate a ball of fake orange cheese.  They melt in your mouth.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to a Cheetos addict to let them see what a more natural like product tastes like.<br /><br />These contain real dairy ingredients and whey, for those who are allergic to milk.<br /><br />My only complaint is the price.  At over thirty bucks a case these are quite expensive.  Grab these when they go on sale for under twenty bucks."
1,"When I found out that you couldn't eat popcorn with braces, I got these for my kids instead. They really liked them (almost better than popcorn!), and the best part is they are very healthy for you. They are made with real cheese, and have a lot of vegetables. I would recommend this product to anyone."
1,"I purchased these as a treat for my kid's lunchbox. She loves they dayglow yellow puffs. She liked these better. Sadly, so did I. : )"
0,It pisses me off seeing pirates booty coming up as a VEGAN item when its obviously not.<br />The seller needs to learn to label/tag their products correctly.
0,"I've bought these in the grocery store before, but apparently I'd forgotten how bland they are. There are better things like this out there, and cheaper too, so I will not buy these again."
0,These are like eating cardboard I am sorry to be negative but they are not as good not even as the reviews have said.Wasted my money by believing in the reviews.
0,"I bought these because my daughter wanted something for a school snack, had tried these in the cafeteria and said that they ""weren't bad"".  Unfortunately, she had changed her mind by the time the gigantic box  arrived on the doorstep.  My huband and I tried them, and I feel like giving a stern punishment to the maker of these things.  Besides having no discernable nutritional content, these things have too much salt, too much fake ""cheez"" powder, and no way to remove it gracefully after you'e eaten a few puffs. We don't like them, and I feel terrible dumping them on the food pantry. Perhaps I'll hide them in a large donation of healthier items."
1,I love these because they are real fruit and my children love them. They are a snack I can be comfortable letting my cildren have without lots of artificial sugar and chemicals.
1,"I love Jivealime! It is citrusy, crunchy and sweet - with no sugar added! Totally satisfies my sweet tooth without the guilt :) This all natural fruit snack is my new favorite mid-morning go-to."
1,"All the Funky Monkey snacks are wonderful. My first favorite was the Applemon, but then I tried the Jivealime and was hooked! Crunchy, tart, just perfect!"
1,"Love this stuff, can't get enough!  All the flavors Funky Monkey offers are good, but I love this one!  If you are a fan of pineapple, you will really like it.  They add just enough lime flavor to make it delicious."
0,I was excited to try these but I did not enjoy the flavor at all. The lime was too tart and overpowered the pineapple flavor. Now I'm stuck with 11 bags of a product that I won't eat!
1,I like the Funky Monkey and would gladly buy more. I just cannot justify the cost ($38/pound).
1,"I purchased this after buying the ""Vegan Brunch"" cookbook for the tofu scrambles.  It smells/tastes exactly like eggs, just what I wanted!  The seller I purchased it from was awesome as well."
1,"I love making scrambled tofu, but it was always missing the authentic eggy flavor. This salt is perfect to help with the flavor I am seeking. It is best to use it after cooking as a finishing salt, otherwise the sulfur flavor gets diminished."
1,Threr is a lot of information in the papersd the seller sends. It is very easy to use it and make your food taste Yummy.
1,"Due to my studies in yoga and Ayurveda I'd heard about the benefits of black salt.  I'm so glad I decided to try it.  It's made a wonderful and interesting addition to my food preparation.  I would recommend that anyone buying it read up on it first because it does have a very unusual odor and flavor (very much like hard boiled eggs, as it is volcanic and contains a lot of sulphur) and the fact that like Himalayan salt you use it as a finishing salt and don't cook it.  Like Himalayan salt, from what I understand, black salt doesn't hold water so it's said it doesn't raise the sodium content in the body.  It's very finely ground so a little goes a long way, and it comes in a really neat little glass jar.  I would definitely purchase again!"
1,Wow this is great coffee! We love the mellow taste. Normally we drink a dark roast but this is very good and has a nice after taste that we like. Nice and smooth. I am going to try other blends from this company. Happy to have found it here on Amazon.
1,"This is not an intro. to bacon chocolate bar....it is for those who truly LOVE BACON.  Perfect combination of milk chocolate and delicious salty bacon. I am in love with the fusion of the two flavors in this bar.  It is worth the price.  For $8, this is a great gift for loved ones.  I believe I paid $8.50 at a chocolate shop in Boston, but now that I know it's on here, I will be ordering more. :)"
1,"This is a great mix for a 9x13 or two round pans.  It's plenty of dough to do the job nicely.  This came out nice and moist and provides a great base for experiments...  We wanted a lemon cake one day for a special birthday for my husband's celiac mother.  We used a little lemon extract and lemon zest in the cake.  After it was baked we mixed a little sugar with lemon juice, heated it and poured in on top the cake after first poking the cake with a toothpick to create small holes for absorbing our yummy sweetened lemon concoction.  Sorry I can't tell you my proportions as I simply guessed (a habitual way of approaching cooking for me).  Think creatively and enjoy, knowing that you're starting with a great base!"
1,"This mix makes the most excellent cupcakes/cakes, you would never know it was gluten free.  It's very easy to make but one strange thing happens when you are beating it. The batter seems to climb up the beaters, but it doesn't matter, the end product is a wonderful treat for people who can't eat gluten-typically cake mixes are very dry, however, this one seems to be perfect!  My hats off to Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Vanilla Cake Mix!!!"
1,This tastes so close to regular (wheat) boxed cake mix.  Really good.  Add 1/4 cup cocoa powder (or more depending on how chocolatey you want it) to make into a chocolate cake.  Or try adding some lemon extract to make a lemon cake.  Lots of possibilities.
1,"This is a useful mix, since it can be flavored any way you wish.  I've made two so far: first, a pineapple ""upside-down cake"" (butter a sheet pan, add brown sugar, place canned pineapple rings and cherries on the bottom and juice from the can in the mix).  Poured on the mix and baked as directed on the package.Guests loved it.  Second, I added ground nuts and almond flavoring to the mix, poured it into a bundt pan, and after baking poured a lemon glaze on top.  Delicious.<br /><br />Wish this mix could be healthier.  Ingredients are inferior to the chocolate cake mix, but oh well, cake is supposed to be a dessert."
1,"I have been gluten free for about a year.  I miss eating what everyone else eats and dessert was one of those things.  I made this cake and frosted it with a non-dairy topping and added fruit on top.  It was soo good and everyone else liked it too.  There are so many ways to change out this cake mix by adding ingredients. That's why I orded a pack of 4.  If you are trying to go gluten free, try this product. If you didn't tell everyone it was gluten free they really wouldn' know.  I love ordering from Amazon using Prime as there are no shipping costs and the products come right away."
1,"This cake is perfect for strawberry shortcake. It's a little heavier than a regular cake, but soft and moist, and lightly sweetened.  I whipped up some heavy cream, and cut up strawberries and sprinkled with sugar (so they got juicy), and made a 2- layer cake with a heap of cream and strawberries over each layer. It was scrumptious! No one even knew it was gluten-free! Everyone at our dinner party had a second helping and told me it was fabulous. So easy!"
1,"Many of the other GF mixes out there cost more and make less than this mix.  Now that we can use egg (outgrowing allergies), this mix is an option for us.  I was surprised the first time I made it to see it actually makes a complete 9x13 or 2 rounds!  My 6 year old was thrilled to have a layer cake for his birthday.<br /><br />We shared the cake with family that aren't typically GF, and even Grandpa liked it!<br /><br />We look forward to using this mix with the GF Cake Doctor book for lots of other ideas on how to spruce up a plain vanilla cake.  In the meantime, we are enjoying with just frosting added!"
1,"We are fairly new to the gluten free life, and are still trying to figure out what works for us.  We find this cake mix to taste great and it makes a nice moist, not too dense cake.  I made BRM vanilla cupcakes for my nephew's birthday party and they were well-received by all.  This mix will make a two-layer cake, whereas, many that cost the same or more only make one layer.  We are not fans of all BRM mixes but this one is a keeper!"
1,"I used to pay high prices for the Betty Crocker brand of Gluten Free cake mix but have now discovered that this Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Vanilla Cake Mix is just as good and priced much lower. I use it for cakes but also make peanut butter cookies using this as one of the main ingredients.  They come out so moist that you would think they were ""regular cookies""."
1,"cant even tell this was gluten free! a must buy! moist and delicious. and dosent crumble like most glutenn free mixes, u can even add stuff to this mix for more flavor. great mix! good job bobs red mil!"
1,"I am eating gluten-free and must also be rice-free (due to allergy). I thought I'd never eat another piece of cake again. I was wrong!  I made some buttercream icing out of 10X sugar, butter, vanilla and water. My husband said this cake was awesome!  It was quick and easy to make.  Simple snip that bag and pour into mixing bowl.  Baked up perfectly, slightly browned, and tasted great! This is a must if you eat gluten-free!"
1,Very good product.  Nice flavor.  Makes a whole 9 X 13 cake unlike other cake mixes which only make a one layer or half the amount of this mix.
1,"Sort of followed the directions, mixed in a Kitchenaid stand mixer with the K paddle.  After beating the eggs and adding the cake mix, i dropped in a half cup of soft butter flavor crisco and creamed it in.  Then I added a half cup of unsweetened vanilla soy milk. Mixed as directed.  Baked in a dutch oven with the lid on in my kitchen oven @350F with the convection fan running.  Cooked to 200F~210F internal temp.  Just brilliant very close match to how I remember a wheat flour cake tasting.  Great crumb.  Highly recommended. As I'm a fan of hot Rooibos tea without sugar and no sugar added pie fillings the sweetness was perfect for me.  Very easy to add sugar or Splenda to increase the sweetness.  I suspect that the older reviews may (educated guess on my part) reflect an older formulation of this product.  I got my four pack in March 2012."
1,I like Bobs Red Mill products because they are not hiding behind deceptive label practices. What you read on the label is what you get.<br /><br />I no longer by prepackaged or processed foods because they all have a tendency to lie. If you pay for a product you deserve to know exactly what is in it. White lies are still lies.
1,This cake mix is great. Its become our families favorite :) We have made it for several  birthdays and holidays now.
0,"We are very new to baking and eating gluten free. This cake was easy to bake. It did not get eaten because of the lack of taste. It did not taste like a cake. It was not sweet at all. It was more like wheat bread. Half the cake got thrown out. I think we needed to add ""something"" to the mix to make it sweet and it would have been a hit with my kids. I personally would NOT recommend unless you know how to add stuff to a recipe."
1,"This cake mix was all the things that a cake should be moist, soft, finely textured and delicious.  If there was one complaint to be made it would be that it was a litte too sweet for my personal taste but nobody else thought this way.  I bought this for my son but gave it to some gluten eaters who said that they could not tell the difference and wanted to eat more!  This makes it a winner in my book."
1,"We love this cake mix. Not only can you make vanilla, but we make pumpkin cake, spice cake, and the list goes on! You can add almost any flavor to this mix and get a great cake every time! Do a little experimenting yourself and the best part is that all those non GF people won't know that it's GF."
0,"I found this mix to have a strong bean taste to it.  I tried it a couple of times.  First just the way the mix says, which I did not like the taste at all nor did my hubby.  The 2nd time I added some vanilla to the mix in which did give it a bit of a better taste and was something my hubby said he would eat.  For me over all just to much bean of a flavor and I will never by it again."
1,"Over the course of fifteen consecutive years, I have eaten many brands of shortbreads made in Scotland.  Of all of these, I enjoy Borders brand the best.  The owners of a small English tea shoppe, where I orginally purchased Borders brand, retired from their business.  That left me not knowing where to find a new seller.  However, I was fortunate to find the product available through Amazon."
1,This tea is magnificent. It's loose leave tea and you only need a small teaspoon per cup so there's plenty to go around. It smells heavenly. I wish I could get a potpourri version for my house.
1,These have become our new office addiction.  We have gone through about 8 bags in a couple of weeks.  Yummy
1,This is the best k-cup that I have tried so far.  Everyone always asks me what flavor it is and it tastes just as great. Light buttery aroma.
1,"Great sesame seeds! very good to make tahini, it was so thick and pasty used on my hommus. Used for cooking too. Excellent, will purchase again."
1,"I bought this for my gluten intolerant girlfriend.<br />Normally, I do not care for the taste and/or texture of GF items.<br />These brownies were very good, I'd buy them again."
1,"These are excellent.  I am a St Louis native (but now reside in Virgina) and have been a customer of Bissinger's Chocolate for over 20 years.  I have never had better quality chocolate (okay I have had some amazing Swiss chocolate).  All their products are excellent, we really love the black sesame crunch, especially my Arabic husband, who may be a little bit of a sesame seed snob.  Did I mention this is GLUTEN FREE!!!  Bissinger's web site specifies gluten free on many items.  The service from Bissinger's is truly 5 star."
1,We've tried the pumpkin and almond varieties and both were wonderful.  Hard to stop eating.
1,"This item was referred in an e-mail from Hungry Girl so I thought I'd give it a try.  Aside of sesame seeds in your teeth, this product it wonderful!  The taste is different than anything I've ever tasted before.  What a great combination of flavor.  Would definitely recommend!"
1,"The taste on this is wonderful, and you don't have to feel guilty about indulging! Has a decent amount of protein, low carbs and the sugars are very reasonable (I am someone who watches sugars, carbs and protein very carefully).  So this is a treat that not only do I feel good eating but tastes heavenly! A wee bit pricey, yes. But if you are someone who wants awesome taste and is really sticking to a more healthier lifestyle than this product will NOT disappoint you."
1,"This great tasting pasta is a diabetic's Godsend! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for ways to reduce my carb intake. Up till now that has meant avoiding pasta completely since a single serving of normal pasta has about 35 - 40 carbs. This has been one of the biggest impacts to my diet as we love Italian cooking. I was not sure about Dreamfields' claim to only have 5 carbs, but we gave it a try anyway.<br /><br />After having a full serving, my blood sugar levels only took a modest rise, about what I would have expected from 5 carbs (plus the 15 others from the rest of the meal)!<br /><br />It does cost more than regular pasta, but it is worth it to me to be able to eat pasta again.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!"
1,"This pasta does not raise my blood sugar.  Watch your sauce, use a marinara sauce and you will do well."
1,If you are not into the texture of whole wheat pasta....try Dreamfields Pasta.  It has the Good Housekeeping Seal!  You can't go wrong because each serving has 5 grams of net usable carbs which is so much healthier for your body than regular pasta.  Check it out for yourself and smile.  :  )
0,"It tastes great but doesn't stand up to scientific testing on its claim of ""low-carb"" or their other marketing.  Dreamfield's is a fraud.  Just search for National Institute of Health on their findings for this pasta and its affect on blood.  In part ""In 10 people without diabetes, the Dreamfields pasta product we purchased did not result in an improved glucose excursion when compared with a commercially available traditional pasta product as would have been expected based upon the company's claim.""<br /><br />Do your own research folks!  Especially if you have Type 2 Diabetes!"
1,I buy a case of this pasta every year at Christmas time for my mom. She is a diabetic and can't get this product locally.  She loves the flavor and texture of this pasta and it has little impact on her blood sugar so it allows her to have the pasta dishes she loves without wreaking havoc on her diabetes.  Great product.  I've been using this pasta exclusively for the past 8 years.  It's been a great way to remain on my low carb program and enjoy my favorite pasta dishes!
1,"My wife is a pasta lover and diabetic. Although we do not count the carbs as 5g (that would be a free food) we count it as 2 servings (30gs instead of all 42g). Our dietitian says preliminary investigations look promising but the jury is still out regarding the amount of carbohydrate effect on blood sugar levels of diabetics (types 1 and 2) but that it is a good source of fiber. Good tasting and good source of fiber, Dreamfield's Pasta in moderation, works very well for us."
1,"First the taste - I'm a huge pasta lover and this tastes just as good to me as any pre-made pasta I've ever had. It's also completely filling and satisfying.<br /><br />I'm pre-diabetic and so far seem to have elevated blood sugar only in the mornings, so this may not be relevant to people with full diabetes, but here are the results of my tests. An evening meal including a double portion of Dreamfields and 30 grams of carbs from another dish gave me a modest rise in blood sugar, about what I'd expect from a 40-50 gram meal. On another occasion when I ate a double portion of Dreamfields alone in the late morning, my blood sugar had dropped slightly six hours later. I had read a couple of people complaining that they got high readings eight hours or so after eating Dreamfields but this doesn't seem to happen to me.<br /><br />Extra fiber is always another plus. With the lowered carbs Dreamfields should also be lower calorie but there don't seem to be any official claims for that.<br /><br />Again according to my readings: don't overcook it, reheat it, or cook it in something acidic like tomato sauce or the carb-hiding effect will be lost. (It's fine to add tomato sauce after the pasta is cooked.)<br /><br />The only drawback is the price, but it's well worth it to be able to eat pasta and not be concerned about the carbs."
1,"I have been using Dreamfield's Pasta for the past year. It tastes amazing. In fact, I like it better than regular pasta. It never clumps together when cooked. As a recently diagnosed Diabetic, I have noted that my blood sugars do not soar up following a Dreamfield's Pasta meal. That's a bonus given that most high carb meals cause a huge peak in blood sugars. We don't have it available locally so I order it through Amazon and it usually arrives within a week. Great product and will continue to purchase it."
1,"This pasta is great, you would never know it is low carb. It is the only pasta we eat!"
1,"This is the best healthy pasta option on the market.  Taste great, has high fiber content!  With the economy the way it is, you cannot beat the value of pasta."
0,"I care less about carbs than I do calories for weight control, and when I went to the Dreamfields website it gives a very confusing and evasive explanation of the number of calories per pack. So I emailed for an explanation and the explanation was equally evasive. It says to essentially to forget the FDA required nutritional label of 190 calories because you will only be digesting 129 calories. So I asked and they later confirmed that yes you are actually putting 190 calories in your mouth, but I guess you have to accept their opinion that you only will absorb 129. I keep a journal of all calories, so do I document 190 or 129? If it was only 129 why would they be required to put 190? To me it sounds like a game, the same game they appear to be playing with the carb count. Unless it is otherwise univerally accepted by the scientific community I say it has 190 calories."
1,"I was surprised that a ""modified"" pasta could taste so good. I'm not diabetic, but want to eat healthier where I can, so this pasta peaked my interest. I cooked it very simply - just added a good olive oil, salt, pepper, and dried marjoram after it was boiled (slightly undercooked) - very good. I could see where you might not stay full for long with the reduced carbs, but if you want to be able to eat pasta this is a good one to try."
0,"I tried this pasta because it was on sale at my local store, I usually buy the discount-priced store brands. And I was willing to excuse the slightly higher price (even with a coupon) on the premise I was eating 'heathy'.<br /><br />Well, I found out that after eating a dish of this stuff, I felt hungry again by dinner. I have fairly good diet control, so I assumed it was the low-carb construction. Having not eaten a low-carb pasta before, I was theorizing on it's effects.<br /><br />I then did some independent web research on this suspicion. And other people also had the same experience after having eaten this product. It does not leave you full. This defeats the purpose of eating.<br /><br />Buying this product at any price was a waste if I was not nourished. I might as well only had been imagining about eating. And considering that I buy pasta to be economically frugal in today's oh-so trying times, this is one brand which won't be cooked up again."
0,"Google ""propylene glycol"" to find out why.  I bought this product, along with several others, without running the ingredients by my wife first (a nurse of 30 years) she<br />was surprised when she noticed it.. we went a googling, and poured my $50 order down the drain afterwards.  There's ""pure"" and then there's ""not so much""....."
1,"For clean teeth, wanted to add a crunchy biscuit to my dog's meals. This fit the bill. Smaller size means fewer broken pieces."
1,They're a little hard for small dogs - I actually have to break them up for my Shih tzu & Pekinese but they love them.
0,"I know this should be a review of the actual product, but I want people to be aware of my situation. I normally trust amazon and would recommend most products through amazon.com. However, the condition I received this box of treats was unacceptable. I purchased what I believed to be a new, unopened box of dog treats, but what I received was an open box with tape all around the sides, including where the ""tear here"" tab was torn off. I can't tell if any treats are missing, but this is definitely not a ""new"" box of treats."
1,Finally found a product that really works on dog's teeth. Keep up the good work. I will be buying  more of these.
1,"Our vet recommends--nags--that we brush our dogs' teeth. Our dogs, on the other hand, think that's an awful idea and are not the least cooperative. Therefore, we try to give them treats that might have some benefit to their unbrushed teeth. Our puppy gobbles these down, no matter the flavor, but our senior dog (who is medium-fussy) will only eat the chicken. In general, she will not eat bacon or beef dog food, and apparently that applies to treats as well. So...in our house, 1 paw up, 1 paw down."
1,"I have been eating these pepperonis for 15 years.  I have had two go bad in storage but that is not Bridgford's fault.  They store for a year or more at room temperature if you keep them in a cool room but if one gets a puncture in the wrapper or exposed to too much heat, etc., then all bets are off.  If the wrapper is still vacuum tight and the expiration date has not passed, then it should be fine.  If the wrapper is loose at all or the product has expired then, yes, you might have one that is bad.  If it is as bad as some here describe then it is my guess they are eating spoiled food.  Not smart.  But in 15 years of eating these, I have only thrown out two for spoilage and that is after having stored them for quite a while.<br /><br />These do have more fat (and more flavor) than bagged pepperoni.  They do make great pizza but you will have a hard time slicing them as thin and even as some big factory - so just don't expect the exact look, feel, and taste.  These are still delicious in their own right.<br /><br />I have to laugh about reviews from folks who eat seemingly spoiled food and then say that anyone who likes this must work for Bridgford. No, I do not work for Bridgford.  I just eat their products."
1,"This is great pepperoni, but it's not for everyone. If you're tired of buying the limp tasteless mush they package precut in bags at the grocery store, this is what you should buy. It's good seared, baked, and raw. We've served it frequently with cheese and crackers. Many guests (but not all) appreciate the bold flavor. For a pack of three and with a subscription, this price can't be beat. It'll last you a good long while.<br /><br />(Just make sure to cut off the casing before eating!)"
1,"The person with the negative view must have received pepperoni that had accidentally been punctured at some point. Something is definitely wrong. I have been eating this pepperoni for over 30 years and it is fantastic! Thirty years ago, my brother convinced me to put some slices of the pepperoni in my spaghetti sauce; it was outrageously good. I have used it ever since--me and my entire family.<br /><br />I even eat it ""raw"" (can't be raw or it wouldn't keep). It's one of my primary snacks on the Atkins (and I've lost 25 lbs). I hope the nay-sayers try it one more time--they are missing out.<br /><br />The super Wal-Marts sell it and they are always running out. And by the way, I live in Sacramento and I'm an instructor at a college; don't work for Bridgeford! I'm only online because Wal-Mart runs out so fast (just came from there) and I would like to buy a large supply I can count on. Actually, I have two, inch and ahalf pieces that I've hid from my husband in the fridge. I guess I'm addicted!"
1,"Haven't bought this online, just at the supermarket.<br />It's good on homemade pizza. Thick slices are amazing. Just peel off the casing or it warps the pepperoni into a concave dome that pools the fat. And there's TONS of fat.<br /><br />Another tip would be to put the cuts on paper towels then nuke them. Good to get rid of as much grease as you can.<br /><br />LOL at the people eating them ""raw"" and giving it a negative review. What the hell are you expecting?<br />This isn't a sausage stick to eat like you just bought from a gas station.<br />The fat content is way too high be to eaten plain. Add chunks to a soup, bread, whatever."
1,"I wasn't sure what these pepperoni slices would taste like, (since Bridgford isn't a brand I'm familiar with) but was pleased with the purchase.  Unlike the other review, there was no foul smell upon opening any of the packages.  The taste, right out of the packaging, was great.  Will definitely be ordering these again."
1,"How convenient it is to have a big stick of pepperoni on hand? Very! Now all I have to do is slice what I want for my pizza, chunk it for a salad or in pasta. It works for everything. Spaghetti sauce gets an extra kick with pepperoni added. I'm still working on things to add it to."
1,"My family loves homemade pepperoni pizza so this is the perfect item to keep in the pantry! Great flavor. The one thing I like the most is there is NO expiration date, only the fact that you must keep the package refrigerated after opening. So these are shelf stable and buying six packages at once means I will have them on hand when I need them. Will be ordering more!"
1,I ordered this product and absolutely love it! I will definitely order again and recommend to others. I have been on weight watchers and was really missing my pepperoni when I found this... 12 slices = 2 points :-)<br />I saw a few reviews that said this was not great and I'm here to say that's totally not my opinion. I think that it has even more flavor than regular pepperoni.<br />Has a great spice to it and works great to make a flat bread low point pizza without feeling like your skipping on taste.
1,What a wonderful surprise this turned out to be. If you love real pepperoni buy this. I recommend this wholeheartedly.
1,"I have been preparing pizza at home exclusively for over 20 years and only considered recently to purchase pepperoni in quantity to get a better price. I had tried several brands over the years but this brand has not been offered in my area. After reading other reviews I decided buying 3 pounds was not a big risk.<br />I knew not having a meat slicer was going to be a challenge but I also knew that ""practice makes perfect"".<br />The flavor is different from what I considered to be the best of pepperoni I had tried, but I have not tried any that may have been considered gourmet quality, and I like it. It is oilier but I don't consider it excessively oily.<br />The bottom line is that if you enjoy preparing pizza from home you should try this Bridgford pepperoni. I have had 2 shipments and both arrived in 3 business days."
1,"This pepperoni is chewy and a bit oily-- good if you're into that. It's also got a surprise in the form of a strong paprika aftertaste that kicks in about 10 seconds after you've eaten a piece (or two, or however many you're going to munch on at that instance). If you're sensitive to spicy food, this probably isn't for you.<br /><br />Each package yields enough pepperoni slices to populate roughly two 12"" pizzas (one if you really want to pile on the toppings)."
1,"It's definitely good on pizza. My advice is to slice thin, as thin as you can make it. This pepperoni is GREASY!"
1,"I love this! I do not buy it here, but at the store. I like it on pizza of course. But I also like to eat it right out of the container it comes in!  It's good on crackers by itself or with cheese, on hot dogs, in soup & pasta dishes. It is a little drier than other products I've tried. But that is ok, because I don't like peporoni that is too greasy. This product also does not give me heartburn & many of the others do. I like the product! GOOD!!"
1,"Off and on over the years I've kept a package of pepperoni in the frig because it's a great ""seasoning"" product.  You can throw a few into just about any savory dish to add extra flavor.  It works a lot like bacon in that regard, in those instances where you don't need a lot of meat, but a little helps to round out the dish.  You can use these instead of adding flavoring fats too, like butter or olive oil.  It adds variety and broadens your options especially for quick cooking, or when you are out of some of your usual basics and don't feel like running to the store.<br /><br />The problem sometimes is that some brands of pepperoni taste a bit odd - perhaps chemically, or greasy, or papery and bland.  These are good.  I will say that these aren't super-intensely flavored, but to my mind that is good for my purposes.  If you want to get an intensely flavored pepperoni for a particular application or for direct snacking, I figure you want to hit up your local Italian market.<br /><br />I also like the size and thinness of these - they are very thin, which I think is great, because I typically would use these in circumstances where I would want only a few and well distributed in small pieces.  I can use these whole where with some other brands that are cut thicker I'd typically have to cut them up some first.<br /><br />These also taste fresh and have a nice texture."
1,We are big Pepperoni fans in my house but can't eat that much of the unhealthy real stuff.  This is the closest to real Pepperoni that I could find and I've tried them all. (even Boars Head Turkey Pepperoni can't compare)  I have had this coming in through Subscribe and Save as long as I can remember.  Great on Salads.  Even better heated.
1,"I ordered 3 sticks and was pleasantly surprised that they arrived (in Egypt) about two weeks later.  I got them home and immediately opened one because I have been craving pepperoni since I got here three months ago.  The flavor is awesome.  It's very spicy, but in a good way.  Heat in the microwave for a few seconds to get some of the extra grease out of it."
1,"Pepperoni with a bite! Delicious for appetizers or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029JW96I"">Bridgford Pepperoni, Old World, 16-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 3)</a>chopped finely to mix with scrambled eggs, and of course great on Pizza. Makes macaroni and cheese special also. Unexpected guests can be served speedy appetizers; just slice & serve with cheese and fruit! Love it."
1,"Bridgford Pepperoni,Old world, has to be one of the great tasting pepperoni's for anyone who likes pepperoni. I have had three orders of this pepperoni, the last being this past Christmas, wow what a surprising  Christmas gift, and I will be ordering more in the furture.<br /> Thank you Bridgford and Amazon for this great product."
1,VERY VERY GOOD!! COULDN'T HAVE ASKED FOR ANY BETTER!!!! I WILL BE BACK FOR MORE. PLUS FAST SERVICE AND EXCELLENT PACKAGING
1,"This pepperoni is a fixture at our family New Year's Eve party, and local stores have stopped carrying it.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon at a competitive price!"
1,"Bridford Turkey Pepperoni, it has half the calories as regular pepperoni only 70, regular pepperoni has 140 calories. I found it locally and I have been eating it ever since, I use it when making Pizza and it tastes very good, I like it when it gets crispy in the oven on top of the pizza. I am not an expert in pepperoni, however this low calorie choice does a great job, it doesn't have any after taste or all that grease, maybe because it is made with turkey (less grease, fewer calories) and high quality ingredients. I love low calorie turkey pepperoni! Thank You"
1,"This review is for the regular sliced pepperoni. The way I use them is to nuke them in the microwave for a couple minutes and it makes a nice spicy pepperoni chip for a low carb diet. Kind of reminds me of thin slices of spicy bacon. Anyway I have done this with lots of different kinds of pepperoni. This pepperoni astonishes me at the quantity of fat that is thrown off during cooking. The grease soaks through several layers of paper towel. People talked about eating them raw and if you did, that would be a lot of fat! No other pepperoni I have tried has generated this quantity of fat during cooking.<br /><br />Now once they have crisped up and you have gotten rid of most of the fat, they are crispy and quite nice. The slices are very thin, so if you go too long they will burn in a flash. I am going to try the thick sliced to see how they work.<br /><br />**UPDATE** tried the thick sliced and they are perfect for my application of pepperoni chips! Way better than the thin sliced. Still amazed by how much orange grease comes off these things during microwaving, but when they are done cooking they are a great consistency and have a nice amount of kick to them. Kind of like spicy bacon. I imagine the thick would be very good on pizza if you don't mind some oil added to your pie."
1,"Good texture and spice.  Nice n salty.  Not ""artisan"" standards but who wants to spend $20 for a stick of pizza topping?!?"
1,"This is the real stuff!<br />I was glancing through as I usually by Bridgeford from them directly, but in a pinch, some to give friends for the holiday without big shipping costs might be a good idea.<br />This is the real, old time, hard pepperoni with a spicy flavor that is great! I like it even more than the smaller sticks you find in some of the old Italian grocery.meat markets, mainly because of the spicy nature. (That's not to discount thos sticks, they're great, too.)<br />I don't just recommend this, I give it to friends as gifts. (Na, I don't wrap them. I just hand half a stick to them and say... Here, have some real pepperoni!)"
1,This Old World Pepperoni is worlds better in taste than your standard pre-sliced Pepperoni in a bag found in most grocery store which is relatively flavorless and uninteresting in my opinion.  We bought this at SamsClub for years before they stopped carrying it and is great for our home made pizzas.<br />The Pepporoni is seasoned well and makes all the difference in home cooking!
0,"Those people who wrote positive reviews on this pepperoni are definitely their workers doing their job behind the computer.<br />These smell bad, taste bad and looks bad.<br />I love pepperoni, I love them cooked but preferably eat it raw.<br />They should be licking finger good. But Nope! Not these.<br />It has that after taste and before taste. Very strong beefy like taste.<br />Like that other one star review, it smells awful but not that bad when eating.<br />It is edible but definitely not enjoying ones.<br /><br />I'm gonna try to put these on pizza and have it cooked all the way.<br />Or else We're gonna throw away 6 packs of these."
0,"The first thing I noticed after opening the sealed bag was a godawful smell. It really slaps you in the face.  The taste, well, it's not as bad as the smell, things things are edible, but I can't really say I would enjoy eating them.  The good news is that after eating about a few of them, it totally killed my appetite."
1,The description said there were 11 different flavors but there were actually 21! Some of them were repeat flavors but different manufactures but those also taste different. Overall a very fun way to use my Keurig machine!
1,"Great variety pack, Enough to let you know which teas you like and to order in the future. Great product."
0,"i was expecting a, packaged,  Tea Sampler package from ""k-Cup"".. not a bunch of single,random k-cups throw into an amazon box. some of the k-cups were damaged and already had holes in them. this is not what i was expecting at all."
1,Other reviews I read warned of having too many of one type in the box.  Not true in my case - the box had a very nice variety of teas.  there were a couple that had duplicates but that was kind of wahtI was expecting.  I am very satisfied with this transaction.
1,"I was wary purchasing the variety pack after reading/seeing the pictures associated with the product. However, I just received mine and I was very happy to see that each variety pack I ordered was in its own separate box and the variety provided was exactly as pictured. I would urge anyone considering buying the variety packs from crazy cups to do so! I am very happy with it and I can't wait to try the flavors with my new keurig! Although I would like a tea pack that is more iced teas, I am excited to try all the different teas included in the pack, especially their sleepytime and green tea with pomegranate!"
1,"I love having the huge selection without having to buy an entire box of one kind.  This gave me the chance to try some things that I would not have.  Sometimes I want to try that new flavor, but I just don't want to spend the money on the whole box.  It did come with a few mint flavors which I had to toss.  Mint is a severe migraine trigger, but the rest of the cups are all very good!"
1,"What a great selection of teas, there is something truley for everybody,wether hot or cold,this was was a excellent selection and variety of teas.. thanks guys"
1,"great, cheap, can not find it anywhere else for cheaper. arrived on time, no complaints or issues.  recommend for office or home if you just want to try out all different types."
1,"My box didn't include Sleepytime and Orange Spice, and I wanted to try both of those before buying a whole box so that was a little disappointing. Other than that, I'm pleased with the variety for the price and accomplishing my objective with this sampler."
1,This package of k-cups was exactly as described.  It's a great and affordable way to try a variety of different flavors without having to commit to an entire box that you may not like.  Delivery was also very quick!
0,"What a disappointment..the picture shows many different varieties of teas which is exactly what I wanted but which was NOT what got delivered.  I received NO mint, peppermint, chamomile, peach, raspberry, mandrin orange spice and no southern sweet half and half!  I did recieved mostly earl grey, black tea and green tea along with way too many chai teas and I don't even like chai tea!  If I can return this shipment I will and I certainly wound NOT recommend this to anyone who wants the variety displayed in the picture....you won't get it!"
0,I ignored the reviews because I figured it would not be that bad. Was I ever wrong. Very disappointed in the horrible selection. Not even one iced tea. Not one. And half of the regular tea was Green Tea. What a joke. Do yourself a favor and just move on. I wish I did.<br /><br />Amazon you should be ashamed of this product. You need to seriously consider how this process works.
0,"I ordered this to try a varity of samples to see which flavors I would like, instead I get only 4 flavors there you'd be no more than two f a kind to get a good cross sampling of flavors."
0,I was very disappointed when I received the product(s).  The 35 K-cups were loose in the packaging box.  The product is described as a pack of 35. I am uncomfortable that the K-cups are not in a sealed box from the manufacturer.  How do I know these cups were not discarded leftovers from serveral variety packs?  I doubt I'll use the K-cups and there are no returns.  Buyer beware.
0,"Although the title doesn't say it, the product description states multiple times that this product is 100% decaf.  Of what I received, I counted 9 of the 35 to actually be decaf (25%).  Looks like a nice selection of teas, but it's not all decaf.  Buyer beware.<br /><br />-------------<br /><br />Update - 30 DEC:  it appears that the product description has been updated."
0,i recieved a different flavor than what i ordered but tried it and it was terrible<br />i wished i returned it at the get go<br />only 12 more ugh bottles left
1,"It is very difficult to find red pistachios in stores, so I was thrilled when I found them online.  They were fresh and delicious."
1,"Since our local grocery stores no longer carry 'red' pistachios, I went on the internet to find them and fortunately, I discovered that Superior Nut Company has them available to purchase online.  I ordered the 5 pound bag and they arrived quickly, were very fresh, well packaged and yes, they were actually red.  We have been enjoying these and when they are close to being fully consumed, I will not hesitate to re-order from Superior."
1,"Organic, dark chocolate and Fairly Traded -- what more could you ask for?  These are the best mint chocolates on the market -- the mint ""crisps"" are so much more fun than just plain old mint.  In my efforts to have a heatlhier lifestyle and diet, this is one treat I still allow without feeling any guilt!  Try these, you'll agree.  The only thing better would be to putthem on subscribe and save!!  Thanks Amazon."
1,"I had my dog on Nutro <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006348XG"">Nutro Natural Choice Lamb Meal & Rice Formula Small Bites Dog Food- net wt. 40 lbs.</a>but after trying Kevin Trudeau's diet for myself I figured having a food that stopped her from pooping so much maybe wasn't a good idea for her. It gives her the same benefits as her previous diet, but without ruining her future health. She loves the dry and canned food and often has to protect it from the finicky cat."
1,"yum I haven't had these for years, they were actually fresh and not old blow pops like some I have bought before. good price too"
1,These are great in a salad. Great price (when I bought them). Would buy again.
1,"Fructose is fructose. It's a simple sugar found in plants, both fruits and vegetables. Buying fructose is like buying salt. Brand names don't matter much. I'm sure there are conspiracy theories about fructose, but as an old woman I'm tired of hearing ""The sky is falling! The sky is falling!""  First it's ""Don't eat butter."" Then it's ""Butter is good for you."" Etc. Etc.<br /><br />Getting away from health issues, I have to say that if you want to buy fructose, this Amazon item is a bargain.  You get a LOT of fructose for the money. I think it's less expensive, pound for pound, that the fructose I get from Publix."
1,"This product is what all should be using instead of the refined sugar that is everywhere. It's sweeter, you use less and it's easy to store and keep. The seller of this item got the package with 3 bags to me in record time and for that alone deserves 5 stars. Highly recommended to all"
0,"This product states on the label ""Fructose FRUIT Sugar,"" but the fructose in this product is in fact not made from fruit; it is made from corn.  Corn is not a fruit product.  I think it is deceptive of NOW to label their fructose sugar as ""Fructose Fruit Sugar"" when it's not."
0,"This review is intended to help buyers make an intelligent decision as to the reason for buying this product. I emailed Now Foods requesting information concerning the mercury content of their granulated fructose because I consume so much of it. Their response was ""mercury is less than 400 parts per billion"". For myself this is unacceptable because I eat fructose and mercury is poisonous. I wish they would bring it down to a reasonable level or better yet find a new way of distilling fructose that is as economical as the Castner-Kellner process."
1,"I was a bit surprised by the previous review, the reviewer obviously didn't do their research. We highly recommend this product - we settled on this one after we lost two beloved dogs to the Chinese poison in dog food incident a few years ago.  We did our research and found this to be the best available.<br /><br />This is a very healthy base to which you add protein.  Our two Aussies are thriving on this - it has been their main meal for over a year, and they are strong, active, and healthy due in part to the food we give them (we eat organic and healthy, and our dogs do too).  It does smell like alfalfa, but even the most cursory examination reveals a great variety of good, organic foods."
0,"I have tried several of the premix bases for dog food. My dog is on a raw diet. When this bag of premix arrived, I was terribly disappointed. It was like receiving a bag of mulched grass. There was very little fruits or vegetables as claimed on the label. It smells like a bag of fresh cut hay. From the look and smell, it's almost all alfalfa. There are other premixed bases available that are much better. I am mixing it with other mixes to make it more appealing to my dog."
1,"I drink multiple different flavors of Nuun all day long. This is a nice refreshing, not too sweet flavor. When I race and will only have water, I use this for a flavor change."
1,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:25 Mins<br /><br /></span>These are unbelievably strong.  I love blueberries. The taste is stunning and overpowering.  My wife's eyes got really big on the first try and she exclaimed ""wow, you can really taste the blueberries"" (I didn't have to tell her it was supposed to be blueberry).  After the first one, I am in deep fear of eating the whole bag in seconds, but due to the molasses and ""natural flavor"", they seem so overpoweringly sweet, so after 4 of them (about 35 calories total), I can't take another.  This is good because it's a sweet that prevents me from wanting more.<br />This is for those who like things intense. you like things intense.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />===========<br />Molasses, wheat flour, blueberry puree, citric acid, natural flavor, licorice extract<br /><br />No fat, 8.7 calories per piece, 10 grams per piece.<br /><br />Serving size of 15 pieces (4 times more than I want to eat in 1 sitting):<br />130 calories: 21 g sugars out of 30 g carbs with 1 g protein.<br /><br />Video Comments<br />=============<br />The video is a taste test with my 3 year old son.

My goal has been to find something that does not have Twizzler's Red-40. His little sister did not like them at all."
1,"i have not had other panda flavors, but i do really like the blueberry licorice.  good ingredients such as molasses, wheat flour, blueberry puree to name a few.  like a good licorice, it's soft and chewy.  there's roughly about 40 pieces in a 6 oz bag.  although i usually don't like black licorice because of it's strong taste, the licorice flavor here is more subtle.  i highly enjoy and recommend this licorice treat for a quick snack.  it's good!"
1,Great tasting licorice the best I have found on the market in this flavor.  And it is more healthy then regular licorice by far!!
1,"First of all, let me start this review by stating just how much I love Panda Licorice. Period. They are the best brand of licorice, hands down, in my humble opinion. This particular breed of licorice - their new blueberry flavor - doesn't disappoint. You taste that beautiful blueberry puree, and it just makes you smile. I ordered the six pack in the baggie, and I am already halfway done with them, if that gives you a sense of just how much of a licorice fan I am. Yum."
1,"I've enjoyed Zhena's teas in the past and decided it was economical to begin purchasing as loose leaf.  This has not disappointed the leaves are in good shape, minimal dust and the aroma is incredible.  Would highly recommend."
1,"My kids love this. It's cheap and tastes like chicken noodle soup. I could care less about the nutritional facts. Anyone can look that up online for themselves. Thing is, kids love it and it IS cheap. Great for budgets.<br /><br />That said, watch that price! This very brand can be had at most local Walmart stores. I just bought a case, this very day, at Walmart for $1.82. One case contains 12 individual 3 oz. packages, so that's $0.15 per package.<br /><br />Here Amazon says ""24 count, 3 oz."" and I have no idea what that means. I can only assume that they mean 24 individual 3 oz. packages. Today Amazon says it is $22.95 which means that each 3 oz. package is $0.96 per package. That is nearly 6 1/2 times the price at Walmart!!!!"
1,"I have used ONLY this Brand and This Roast Chicken Flavor Ramen Soup's As What I mainly do is brake up the Noodle's and add to Canned Soup's And make as directed, but add about 1 to 2 cup's more Water and the Flavor Packet. Makes the canned soup make a larger Pot, and is just wonderful with this ROAST Chicken Flavor packet.<br />Try this and I think you will really Enjoy!!!"
1,"There was a time when we would buy chicken ramen because it was inexpensive.  The flavor is very good and the soup has a lot of noodles compared to canned chicken noodle soup.  This soup is reasonably easy to prepare, and begs to have a few extra vegetables thrown in.  The soup is so simple that even an elementary school child should be able to prepare it.<br /><br />While the soup is relatively low calorie (190 calories), as with many soups it does have a fair amount of salt, with 850 mg of sodium.  If you eat few other foods with much salt, this soup could be a perfect balance.<br /><br />Maruchan Chicken Ramen has been and continues to be a family favorite.  The large quantity of noodles and tasty broth make it perfect for a lunch or dinner meal, especially when you are looking for something a little different."
0,"Eight dollars a can for an item that normally sells for around four dollars a can is a total rip off. This product was available from Amazon a few months back, but hasn't been in inventory in recent months. Regardless, you can purchase at your local grocery for a little over $4 and on-line in quantity for under that. The price this vendor is attempting to charge is indicative of their lack of business ethics - and Amazon's as well, for letting this vendor do business through their site. The product is wonderful, the vendor is evidently a crook."
1,I guess when you go to bed dreaming about your next cup of coffee that means you really love it. That describes my relationship with Maxwell House International Coffee's Cafe Vienna.
1,"Have always loved the product - great taste/not as sweet as all the other flavors....<br />HOWEVER, it did not go unnoticed that the 10 oz. can is now 9 0z. for the same price as the 10 oz. can........even though the actual can is the same size.....did they think we wouldn't notice??????"
1,I have been drinking this coffee for over 25 years and still like it best.  I was dismayed to find it no longer sold in food stores I frequent.<br /><br />The postage is too high and am shopping around for a store still carrying this coffee.
0,"My wife loves this product and has enjoyed it for years. The product is<br />the only coffee I will drink as I am not a coffee drinker.<br /><br />Having said this, the price it is offered at is NOT so good.<br /><br />We have purchased it for under three dollars a tin and regularly<br />buy it, not on sale, for three twenty-eight a tin as of 12/2010.<br /><br />I consider the previous reviewer's comments legitimate as I can<br />get a better deal at the local ""Stuff Mart"". It is a deal once it<br />gets below three dollars a tin."
1,My first experience with 3in1 San Mig Coffee was in Davao City Philippines. I dont drink much coffee but tried this at the hotel I was staying and found the taste to be a great satisfying morning drink. I brought some home and plan to introduce my employees to this quick and easy idea for those who have to have coffee in the mornings or throughout the day. Quick and easy and satisfying.
1,"I'm very pleased with this purchase, my mother and my nephew love picking marshmallows from cereal. These taste just the same, and I loved the price. Thanks! :]"
1,"Since my husband and I met 16 years ago, there has been an ongoing struggle with the lucky charms... I hate the cereal and love the marshmallows and try and Ii might, when there was a box the house, I would invariably eat most of those sweet, crunchy, yummy marshmallows.  Now that there are kids in the picture, the problem has become more serious- they don't take my raids so well!  So I gave my mother-in-law a project (she loves projects).  She freeze dried a bag of mini marshmallows in her machine.  We thought it would be fast but it took 36 hours.  And they didn't taste quite right.  After all that my lovely husband said ""did you look on Amazon?"". Well, no I hadn't!  I found these (liked the individual bags to keep them fresh) and placed my order. A few days later I surprised everyone with this special dessert. Rave reviews all around. In fact, they are going in my favorite things holiday gifts!  Love them!"
1,These marshmallows were great! They taste just like the ones out of a box of Lucky Charms. I add these every morning to my bowl of Lucky Charms!
1,"My husband is the one who found out about these and we just HAD to get them. It makes all of your cereals..well...magically delicious! It tastes just like the lucky charms marshmallows. They come in individual bags just like shown on the picture and they are all crunchy little marshmallows, no problems with them being stale here! We will be buying more when we run out."
1,"Loved these.  They got here undamagaed and are all about gone.  WIll be making another purchase soon! I was skeptical at first, but they do indeed taste exactly the same as the ones in the cereal."
1,"I'm not even a fan of Chocolate, but I love this and you can only find it in stores during the holidays.  So I had to get some."
1,"I was so happy to find this tea available on the web. I was afraid that Dynasty had discontinued it.<br /><br />When I lived in California, I just picked this tea up weekly, at the grocery store. A while back I moved to a very rural area of the Missouri Ozarks. Nobody carried this particular Dynasty tea, which has always been a favorite of mine.<br /><br />I refused to use the last 2 bags I had... until my Amazon shipment arrived. Just in case I had a tea emergency. I cannot list any specific health benefits of this tea, I just know how it makes me feel. It makes me feel better, when I am coming down with something... and it cheers me up, when I am sad. The mild blend, and the soothing aroma, can be the best part of a very rough day. It is so good, I drink it ICED in the summer.<br /><br />I did not buy from this seller, however. The $4.00 per box price is double what the retail selling price of the tea is... and the $6.00 shipping (FOR ONE BOX!!!) is more than what I paid to have a whole case shipped to me.<br /><br />I purchased a full case of 12 boxes of 16 ct. teabags, for around $24. And I couldn't be happier. Please continue to sell this tea. It is GREAT!!! Sellers, please be reasonable with the prices and shipping."
1,"The ingredients say oolong, jasmine and green teas but I always think there is a bit of sesame mixed in there, too."
0,"This tea is ok, it's not bitter but it is so disappointing. I have been searching for a jasmine oolong that I had in a Japanese restaurnat that was so good. This tea is not it. You can't even really smell the jasmine in this tea. The tea I had at the restaurant was a golden color with a slightly sweet taste and aroma of Jasmine. I have bought so many teas trying to find it. The saleslady at the fancy tea shop assured me that this was the tea I have been looking for. NOT! Years ago, I had a manager that came from Japan and she took me to a restaurant which her family and friends frequented and I have not had tea like that since. HELP, I want to enjoy tea like that in my own home."
1,I didn't know you needed a special machine to make this frothy.  I does make a good instant coffee though.  I just poured it into an empty coffee creamer container to store it.
1,"Yummy but NOT frothy... this is purposed for Latte Cafe machines usually at gas stations like QT/RaceTrack/etc.<br /><br />Having purchased this previously at a Closeout Store, I was thrilled to see it on Amazon for a decent price. I use it like ""brand name la-di-da"" French Vanilla Instant Coffee Beverage that comes in those cute little rectangular tins for a higher price. Just as good and somewhat cheaper, depending on selling price (Amazon cheapest = 6.19 a bag). This size is equivalent to FOUR tins purchased at local stores. Those la-di-das on clearance cost about $2.50 EACH.<br /><br />DIRECTIONS: Use 1.5 - 2.0 Tablespoons French Vanilla Instant Coffee Beverage Mix per 8ozs of Hot Water and Stir.<br />Psst, no matter how much or fast you stir, it will not be frothy :)"
1,"My husband does not drink coffee, but he will drink this.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YVM5DA/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title<br />I have tried other kinds of Cappuccino, and none of them have been as good.<br />I will buy this again and recommend it to friends."
1,"My father a Holland native loves his Leyden cheese!! Every year we struggle to find a place to get it and ship for a reasonable rate. For the first time this year we went through amazon.com/ an excellent choice.  The vendor whom the cheese came from shipped promptly and the experience was more than satisfactory.  Especially pleasing since I ordered days before CHristmas and expected delivery after Christmas, but somehow it arrived on Christmas Eve.... fantastic service and great quality!!!"
0,"Earlier this year, the FDA enacted a new rule forcing companies to take the gluten-free label from anything that has more than 20 ppm gluten.  (I'm looking at you, Arrowhead Mills and Bob's Red Mill.)<br /><br />However, you can be right at 20 ppm, which makes a lot of celiacs sick, and still label yourself, ""gluten free"".  (The rule should have said, ""less than 20 ppm"", not ""20 ppm or less"".)<br /><br />This is where Amazon is fantastic--they made the company list the gluten in this, so we know it's NOT gluten free.  (I have yet to find a Hain's food product that was actually gluten free, although some of them are legally gluten free.  Look for their name on the labels so you know what to avoid, even if they are hiding behind the federal law and they have labeled their products gf.)<br /><br />Pacific Rice Milk and Whole Foods' store brands of rice milk are gluten free, though.  Buy those instead."
1,"Rice Dream has a light, refreshing taste. You can drink this alone unlike soy milk which only tastes good when combined with other foods like cereal.<br /><br />The price here is outrageous though, especially for only 8oz containers."
0,"I used Imagine Rice beverages for many years. I favored them for high quality ingredients, excellent flavor, reasonable price, and wide availability. I find milk and soy products cause digestive distress, rice beverages have no such effect, no cholesterol, very little fat, and taste great.<br /><br />However, Imagine now uses the cheaper canola oil in their rice milk products. Canola oil contains erucic acid, a toxic chemical. The FDA has limited canola oil to no more than 2% erucic acid to protect our health, and do not allow it in infant formula. In additon, studies show the erucic acid it contains is toxic (see below). I have not been able to find any long term longitudinal controlled studies on humans to prove its safety as far as all the adversely affected organs.<br /><br />Rice Dream has two Healthwise Rice beverage products, that use safflower oil and no canola oil, have half as much sugar, and include plant sterols that may lower serum cholesterol levels. Good Karma Whole Grains Ricemilk is organic and also canola and sugar free. It has a thicker, richer and creamier body and flavor, less watered down. The vanilla flavor is a delicious drink. Westsoy Rice Beverage has a similar consistency to Rice Dream with a little more body and milky flavor, and is canola free.<br /><br />The same canola issue (as well as sugar) also applies to the Imagine frozen desert products.<br /><br />Because there have been Internet rumors about Canola that are based on misinformation, I provide some citations of scientific papers and government publications below.<br /><br />Studies on erucic acid in rats and piglets show heart lesions, decreased red blood cell count, and other tissue and organ damage.

0,"Tiny boxes of rice milk averaging $1.00 a box. It also had a weird taste. I buy Rice Dream rice milk all of the time and we like it, but these tiny drink boxes taste weird. A total rip off."
0,The price for this item is three times what you would pay at the store.
0,"I like Rice Dream. This, however, is too high a price for too small a container. Smaller containers waste more packaging materials per ounce of product too!"
0,"The switch to organic is a good step, but Rice Dream rice milk is chalky and too sugary - 23 grams of carbohydrates per serving!  That's close to the sugars in a soda.  A person could get a sugar high or go into sugar shock (if diabetic) with this level of sugar.  I finally stumbled upon unsweetened Almond Breeze vanilla which has 4 grams of carbs and So Delicious vanilla coconut milk which has 9 grams of carbs.  I still have half a dozen sugary rice milks that I'm watering down with homemade almond milk just to reduce the terrifying sugar level.  Unsweetened Almond Breeze tastes smooth and nutty, and regular so Delicious both tastes smooth and somewhat coconutty.  You can even mix the two and even add some rice milk, but rice milk alone is too high in sugars."
1,"Rice milk isn't my favorite non-dairy milk, but I still occasionally drink it. It's a lot thinner than soy milk, so sometimes I like to cook with it. Unless you get non-sweetened, I feel like Rice Dream really adds too much sugar. It's hard to drink straight, sometimes I like to mix it with a non-sweetened variety. It might be good for sometime new to the non-dairy milk world."
0,You can get a better deal purchasing a carton from Walmart or an organic store (Roots) nearby.<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewer.  Amazon should carry the 64 ounce containers!!!
1,"Wonderful product and great shelf life...love the small individual packets...I place two at a time in the fridge; when cold, they taste just like milk for cereal etc..I am lactose intolerant..perfect product.."
1,"I had to leave a review after reading some of the negative ones. I can't use soy or dairy so finding a milk substitute has been interesting. Many of the soy alternatives still list some soy in their ingredient list. This particular Rice Dream rice milk (organic, enriched, original) does not. Further, it is the closest to dairy milk that I have found and doesn't add it's own flavor to whatever you cook like almond (I like almond milk for some things) or hemp milks do. You certainly can live without the 8 ounce size but they sure are convenient. I do hope that Amazon gets this size back again."
1,"Rice Dream is a great alternative to cow's milk.  It is lactose free and has a great, somewhat sweet, and refreshing taste.  My wife and I are addicted to it.  It is also shelf safe and does not have to be refrigerated until opened.  Rice Dream is perfect for travel, camping, and fishing trips.<br /><br />Peter<br />Memphis, TN"
1,I like the small containers because they do not need to be refrigerated which makes it easy to take along in the car.
1,I find these great for school lunches and on the go activities for my son who is allergic to dairy. Arrived quickly and was packaged well.  Pricing with Amazon came out a bit lower than what I find in local supermarkets.
0,"I drink Rice Dream rice milk every single day, but the 8 oz packages are too wasteful and expensive."
0,"We like this item, but wish that it was available in larger sizes, these are way too expensive......"
1,"so glad I found this product. I'm lactose intolerant, and regular milk grosses me out anyway. I've tried soy, but don't like the taste. This rice dream rice milk truly is a dream :) SO glad I found/tried it. Love it to eat with my wheaties."
1,I send a small Rice Dream box daily with my 5 year old to kindergarten.  Thanks for giving him and his allergies a safe alternative.
1,couldn't live without it - amazing - and they just came out with an unsweetened version which makes my life easier - doesn't get any better than this
1,"As a mom of a child with dairy allergies, it's very hard to travel without this product. The small boxes are very convenient, and being that many times the original formula of this milk is hard to find, I'm assured that I have it available when we are out. Yes, a little pricey, but worth it."
1,"This rice drink is healthy and delicious. A great dairy and soy alternative, this rice drink is great to drink by itself, to use in baking, and to use as a creamer in tea and coffee drinks."
1,"Great product.  I use it at work for ceral.  Some reviewers mentioned that these tasted different from the larger size, but I do not notice that at all."
0,"Thank you, Amazon for listing barley in Rice Dream's ingredients.  It is sad that Rice Dream does not list the barley on their packages.  My 15-month-old son has to be on a gluten free diet.  Rice Dream was sabotaging our efforts.  As a thank you to Amazon.com, I purchase cases of Pacific Rice milk from Amazon.  I also save money from purchasing it online than locally.  We have enjoyed Rice Dream for years but if you need to be on a gluten free diet, this is not the product for you.  Purchase Pacific Rice milk."
1,"Not only is this tea good tasting, but it works great as a laxative.  I don't drink this tea every day, but only when I need to restore regularity when I travel.  I always bring a few convenient to pack tea bags with me when I expect to be out of town for more than a few days."
1,"I bought this tea as a way of helping to regulate my system and perform a cleanse. Wow, this tea is gentle, and certainly does the trick. I highly recommend to anyone wanting to perform a cleanse, and enjoys the taste of chamomile tea."
1,"This is an excellent tea, I use to use another brand but it caused my stomach to ache and have several loose bowel movement, with smooth move i have a normal soft free of pain move without the diarrhea and the stomach ache. This is a good product especially if you have hemorrhoids ."
0,"This extract has a very strong alcohol aroma, so much so that it is difficult to discern any pistachio flavor. You might as well use a liquer instead- you'd probably get a better flavor."
0,"Not what I expected, nothing like the illustration on the package.  I have enjoyed Ryvita products previously, but will not purchase this item again. Two seeds and one raisin per brick of corrugated meal do not make the pain of eating one of these worthwhile. Food should not break into shards and try to stab you. Also, the image suggests that the product is toasty golden.  No evidence given of fireblasted blowtorch charring. Tag suggestions: good god I can't feel the roof of my mouth."
1,My local store has not carried this flavor is years.<br />There is a subtle hint of sweetness which I cannot<br />compare to anything else available at my local<br />stores.  I consider this a real treat and I'm glad<br />to have it available to me.
1,"Not only pretty tasty for humans but, after mice in our basement found their way inside a stored box, I discovered they are the ideal bait (in crushed form) for a humane mouse trap. Six and counting in two days."
1,"These are awesome!! Whole grain, sweet, but not much sugar. So as a diabetic, I am happy, happy, happy.<br />A friend (not a diabetic) had one, then two, then three. He begged to buy a box from my secret stash as even in Seattle I can't seem to find a store that stocks them as regular merchandise. They are perfect to pack for a day trip, a late night snack, or any other time something crunchy seems appropriate. Yummmm!"
1,"Although these are yummy, I have guilt about the brown sugar in them. Not actually necessary, and they do have wheat flour whereas regular or multigrain Ryevita just has Rye flour in them."
1,"What a find!  these crackers, I mean crispbreads, are great.  My boys love them as they have just enough fruit and nuts to add a more spalsh of flavor but not so much to overwhelm the taste buds.<br /> We have already gone through two boxes, and that was in a week.  I hope Amazon gets more of their flavors."
1,"These crackers are quite unique.  Interesting that they are called ""Fruit and Seed Crunch,"" because the only fruit in the product is 14% currants, which adds a bit of a tang to the taste, nothing else.  As a Vegan treat, these are quite satisfying.  I smear some peanut butter on two; and that's breakfast.<br /><br />Imported from Great Britain, these crackers are made with whole grain rye and wheat flour and then lightly dusted with pumpkin and sunflower seeds.  Honestly, one of these things is quite filling.  The fiber content is good, too.<br /><br />As part of a healthy diet plan, these crackers are excellent.  Substitute these for bread and see how you like it!"
1,absolute right choice for me! I feel so good with the texture of fiber and pure flavor from seed!
1,"I love the product.  The case I received had short dates, Jan 2013.  Inquire before you order. I'm not sure how easy this would be to do."
1,"This is an excellent choice for a morning meal or an afternoon snack.  I was pleasantly surprised with the sweetness from the fruit in it.  The best benefit is the fiber!  Here is something that tastes great & you still get the nutrition.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E0QE1Y"">Ryvita Fruit and Seed Crunch Crispbreads, 7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 10)</a>"
1,"I love these! I actually don't care for any other flavors of crispbreads, but these make a really nice snack just on their own. I am not a health nut by any means, but these are a great alternative to reaching for typical sweets or snack foods when you need an afternoon snack."
1,These crackers are so good and good for you!  peanut butter is good on them too! With the sweet of the fruit and crunch it satisfies.
1,"I was at my friend's house in Syracuse. I bought these crackers in Wegmans. I loved them, but Hannaford at home doesn't have them so ordered from Amazon. Now all my friends love 'em too!"
1,"Not sure why I can never find this flavor in the grocery stores (none!) RYVITA makes delicious crackers, but this one takes the prize. Spread creamy goat cheese or cream cheese on it and your in heaven."
1,Just sweet enough to be a snack and satisfying enough that I don't need to eat half the box to feel satisfied. No guilt here.<br /><br />I'll definitely buy these again!
1,"As a nutritionist and author,I was always looking for a quality cracker, one with fiber and flavor.  Ryvita Fruit Crunch is it! I've been recommending this cracker to my clients forever, and was shocked to learn that recently they were no longer carried in supermarkets.  Thank goodness for Amazon!  I bought a pack of ten boxes and have been giving them to my clients --and of course keeping some for myself.  Remember that two crackers is the equivalent of having a slice of bread when you have them with perhaps a cup of tomato soup, an ounce of cheese and a little salad for lunch or dinner."
1,Ryvita Fruit and Seed Crunch crispbreads are not too sweet but not so dry and dissicated that you want to smother it in peanut butter (although they taste great with PB!!!).  I eat these straight up as a snack at work or with a morning cup of coffee/tea.  Just the right amount of crunch and sweet.  Lots of fiber and lower in carbs than many others.  Can not beat these crunchy crackers.
1,I love this product and was thrilled to see if offered as a subscription.  It makes a great snack just by itself or a light meal with your favorite nut butter or cheese.  For those of you who use Weight Watcher points 2 crispbreads=1 very filling point
0,"I can't stand false advertising >:-(<br />The crackers are two mostly plain solid layers with stuff in between. I think there may be some seedy and fruity things inside, in between the layers...not really consistent fruit 'filling', but just randomly distributed small fruit/seed bits. Cracker tastes good when your bite happens to catch a fruit thing, but that happens like 3x per a cracker.  (Each cracker is the size of a regular index card.)<br /><br />Basically, CRACKERS ARE NOT SINGLE LAYER COVERED BY TONS OF SEEDS AND FRUIT BITS like you see in the picture!!!  Don't expect that!<br /><br />With that said, they weren't that bad.  NOT sweet (unfortunately), and taste kinda fibery.  Pretty regular dry healthy crackers.  They are not filling, unless you tend to be filled up by index-card sizes of crispy dry whole wheat bread.  But they may help curb your appetite for a short while?<br />I enjoyed them of cheese and honey on top :-) Yummy.<br /><br />Summary:<br />- cracker= 2plain layers with very little fruit/seed bits in between<br />- feels healthy<br />- tastes okay."
0,"I thought the addition of fruits & nuts would soften the cracker & not be as tough as most of all the other Ryvita ""crispbreads"", but ney!<br /><br />They're crispbread for horses!"
0,"Well... looks like hamster food, smells like hamster food, oh yeah and it TASTES like hamster food!  These crispbread crackers are nothing short of disgusting.  Health food does not mean that it needs to taste bad! I find nothing wrong with all-natural foods that actually taste good.  There are plenty of alternatives that offer whole grain and fiber and are much more flavorful.  The no sodium aspect is difficult to ignore but unless your tastebuds have suffered some sort of great catastophre than I warn you to look elsewhere for something more palatable..."
0,"You can get one pack (2count) at Kroger for .97 and at walmart for .94  and if you are signed up for coupons you get $1 off 3 or 4 packages. These are price slightly high. If you like convince of not leaving your home, then go for it."
1,"So far I've purchased the flavors peas, carrots, butternut squash, pumpkin, and green beans.  My baby loves them all.  What's more is the convenience of purchasing them online and having them delivered in bulk to my home -- so easy!"
0,"I was thinking of buying from here but then I thought of checking out the price in Walmart or Walgreens first.<br />Indeed, the price in Walgreens is half of the price here. As of this writing, the Amazon price is $10.69, while the Walgreens price is only $5.00 for a pack of 8."
0,"please be care full with this as i just complained to gerber as i found black powder inside sweetpottato tubs that i got from BJs , just a word of caution as im yet to find out what it is from gerber .upon calling gerber they said it could be charcoal from overburnt product & they are saying "" as far as seal is intact its safe"" hellooo plz dont tell me charcoal or rust or whatever it might be found in a tub sealed can be safe? im now going to be carefull while giving it to my baby .. so please u also be just carefull to see if no black powder is in .. if so discard it ."
1,These carrots are a great first food for baby. They are pretty watery so it's easy to mix them in with rice cereal to introduce vegetable flavors to baby.
1,"This is great for your little one, no artificial flavors or additives. But I found out after buying the stage 1, that stage 2 is cheaper & you get more."

1,This is my 7-month old's favorite food right now. I think it tastes great as well. Gerber did a great job with this one!
1,My daughter loves this. It helped her get hooked onto solids. The price with Subscribe and Save is at par with Walmart.. so I believe as cheap as it gets.
1,"Tastes great. My babies think it is desert.  I like that it is only squash and water, nothing added."
0,"It tastes fine to me, but my son will take 1-3 spoonfuls then spits it out.  Green beans and Spinach he can't keep down.  Hot or Cold he doesn't like this.<br /><br />I still try now and then hoping he'll change his mind.  He's 11 months now since we started him at 5 months and still doesn't like this.  He does like steamed green beans I cook, but not this.<br /><br />I've mixed this with other foods is the only way to get him to eat some because I know its good for him.<br /><br />Good price and value, but not worth it if your child won't eat it."
1,"I got 3 sets of food for my 6 month old to have some variety.  I didn't realize kids are on stage 1 foods for a very brief period so we had to mix these stage 1 foods in with stage 2 and 3 foods to use them. I'm sure these are great if you have multiple children, but for one child, these packs are too large to get more than one, but one box doesn't provide variety..."
1,"Came on time and is perfect, I miss the box but these are still cute.  Highly recommend for classroom or even office usage. I will probably order this again next year as well."
1,"On my last trip to Costco, I picked up a 26-oz. bag of Wild Roots coastal berry blend trail mix. It consists of almonds and cashews along with dried blueberries, cranberries and yogurt chips, It's somewhat high in fat and calories, but it's good vegetable fat. The taste is quite excellent. It's a good product and my only gripe was that the nuts were a bit stale, although the product had an expiration date of Feb. 2013. Well, the Trail Mix was good enough that I bought a second bag at Costco and it was nice and fresh and quite excellent.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
1,My husband loves these.... we were getting them from Costco but they are about an hour away so Amazon delivery is perfect.  These are addicting so watch out!
1,Perfect mix for me - lots of nuts and dried fruit.  I was buying it at Costco for under $9.00 but much as I really like it I hesitate to pay twice at much on line.
1,"We actually get this from Costco, which is only about 10 min from home and less than 5 min from work for me.<br /><br />It just helps to buy these at a much lower price at about $9.99"
1,Delicious.  Just plain delicious.  Wish I could afford a pound.  Arrived promptly and well chilled.  On toast points with creme fraiche it is a perfect delectable snack.
1,"This stuff is incredible.  I picked up a few bottles for my husband who's a big Marley fan and also happens to enjoy tea...  Before he got to them, I had about half a bottle one afternoon while we were playing with our kids.  I sat down on the couch and ended up taking a nap (which is something I never ever do).  Guess I should have read the label first!  I thought it would just relax me, not put me to sleep - so now I drink a half bottle before bed.  Sounds cheesy, but it quiets my anxious mind.  I sleep SO well with this tea and I wake up feeling happy and refreshed (not weighed down and grumpy as I usually am in the morning).  Keep in mind, I'm a lightweight at 117lbs and 5'4.<br /><br />NOTE:  I found this at the store at 1.50/bottle... I'm really bummed that Amazon jacked up the price here."
1,"The flavoring is very good, not harsh at all and very easy to drink. However I can go down to my local grocery and get it at $1.50  a bottle, still making it much cheaper for a 12 pack there."
1,"I was given this by my daughter in law, and it works as I slept through the night, rare for me. Plus it is sweet nectar.  She bought it for me from a party store.  Your price is high in comparison to the party store.  1.79 a bottle vrs 2.60 per bottle when bought in a case of 12 for 31.19. I'm tempted to pay it, but will check out the local stores first."
1,"I visited my mom in California over the holidays and she had some of this in her fridge. One night I decided to try it. Usually I get on the laptop and stay up for hours researching whatever might be on my mind...usually until 2 or 3 in the morning! While drinking this tea I fell asleep in the middle of my research before 10pm, before even finishing the bottle! I finally went to bed and had the best night's sleep. I woke up at 730ish and never felt so refreshed that early (I'm obviously not a morning person).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the prices here are a bit high, and I don't think I can get these where I live. In my opinion, though, unless you can find them locally for cheaper, the $31 is still very much worth it!"
1,the greatest tea ever. i actually am a distributor of this product the only one in so. cal but not being one sided. better than any prescription drug on the market. and better for you in the long term.
1,"I have to get up at 4AM, and the longer the days get, the more difficult it is to fall asleep at a reasonable hour. Not with these wonderful tasting drinks! I am out cold within an hour. . . tops. I have tried Neuro, Zen Serenity, and now these, and these are the best by far (taste, effectiveness, etc.). I wake up feeling great; not like when you take a sleeping pill. Also, I ordered from Marely's (I assume this was a typo), and their customer service was SUPERB when I had a slight issue. As far as the price, a night's worth of sleep without taking a pharmaceutical drug, is worth every penny to me."
1,"The only problem that I have with this item is that it does not in fact put you in a mellow mood. It knocks you out completely. Within an hour of drinking this, I have a really hard time staying awake. That's why I purchased it though, to relax and eventually help get me to sleep. I have also not noticed any side effects with my sleep, when drinking this multiple nights in a row and then stopping, like most sleep aids.<br /><br />It is also really tasty. It holds up extremely well against any other fruit beverage. This may be a con though as constantly wanting to drink a beverage that knocks you out can't be good for your social or work life."
1,"I didn't know that this drink did more than just taste good the first time I drank it. I knocked out (fell asleep!) The taste is great, and we prefer the Black Tea over the green tea version. It is hard to find but we have found it at Sprouts Market and also some Shell Gas Stations. Check MMM's website for Store Locators. Walmart also sells it online but my local Sprouts store is cheaper than any online outlet so far. Good drink! Wish they also made the drink without the sleep effects."
1,Recently found Bob Marley's tea at a few select stores. It is very refreshing and has a nice clean taste to it. It is very relaxing but in no way put  me out. I can drink it any time of the day. I tried both the black tea and the green. The green one is the best and it is sweet but not too sweet. I thought I might be able to get a better deal on Amazon but doesn't come close to the $1.50 or $1.70 that I find them for.
0,Ordered the product in the middle of june and i have yet to receive the product despite contacting customer service
1,"This is a delicious tea that will help you relax before sleep time. Unfortunately, it is hard to find; I did not find it in major retailers and grocers in my area and it's expensive to purchase on-line."
1,"I bought this from my local grocery store just to see what it was about. Looked cool, and I drank a few sips as the can said it might make you drowsy. I definitely felt a ""head change"" the first time i drank it, and immediately went for a red bull to balance out the effects. That night I was having trouble sleeping and was laying awake at 1:30am. I remembered I still had a can of this in the fridge and drank the whole thing.. Within 10 minutes I was out.<br /><br />Just recently I bought this again in case I needed help sleeping (I sometimes have insomnia). I drank half a can and about an hour later (around 2:30pm) I was laying in bed taking a nap. I actually fell asleep on my back, which I NEVER do; always on my side or stomach.<br /><br />Personally, I dont think it should be a ""Bob Marley"" product, as Mike Tyson would be more suitable - since it will knock you out cold."
1,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CT1NCY"">12 Pack of Marley's Mellow Mood - Black Tea Peach Raspberry Passion Fruit</a>I bought this on a whim, in a particularly bad walmart visit.  I was really surprised that after a few sips I was really not so bothered as i thought.  When I got home, I was reading the bottle, saw that it was quite natural ingredients, so since I never sleep for than 3-4 hrs. I bought a case at amazon.  Have used it off and on all month especially when I was upset and not sleeping, the calming affect helps me get back to sleep.  sandy in Central NY"
1,"I got this cuz i like trying new drinks and im glad i read the label before drinking the whole bottle (it being 1pm)<br />I am so happy i found something that is ""natural"" that allows me to fall asleep. i suffer from insomnia and i had half a bottle and i just dozed off and slept though the night. such a great feeling. I went to the store the next day and bought a bunch of them.the Green tea isnt that great . but im not a fan of green tea. you should try it if you have trouble falling asleep!!"
1,"I've ordered this food before, and it's one of my dog's favorites.<br />This last shipment, however, contained many dented cans, which does not instill confidence.<br />I'd say about 20% were dented, though so far all the food has been fine.  This is an observation about quality control more than it is a complaint, and I'll likely order again."
1,This was a terrific bargain.  This is also my dog Jax's favorite dog food and the purchase price was half what I usually spend.
1,"I live in California and have an elderly Aunt in Mississippi. She does not drive and has to depend on others for trips to the grocery store. The prices for things like Oatmeal may not always be competitive with places like Walmart or Costco, but ordering grocery items through amazon.com is a great way for me to help out my Aunt. I just talked to her on the phone while she dictated her shopping list.<br /><br />Thank you for this service, amazon.com!"
1,"This is a good way to start the day and this box will keep you going for almost two months.  Just add hot water and you're set.  It's quick and easy to prepare and very filling.  Plus, the variety pack will keep things interesting."
0,"I purcahsed this oatmeal variety pack assuming I would receive the various flavors listed in the picture such as banana bread and cinnamon roll.<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />I get a box with just 4 flavors including 13 packets of original. Who in God's names wants original quater oatmeal via packet? If you are going to deliver pain like that, then ad and description should state so accordingly.<br /><br />Will not be making this mistake again."
1,I needed some more oatmeal for breakfast and this hit the spot. I myself need more than just one packet and will typically use a plain and another flavor to use up the plain oatmeal. I don't know anyone that wants to eat plain oatmeal but that is my solution for the packs rather than throwing them away. Several people complain of the price but not having to deal with going to the store for it and the taxes of it more than makes up for any differences.
0,"What is pictured and what you recieve is not the same!  The picture when I ordered had 6 or 7 different flavors pictured, one being banana, which is the main reason I ordered and I recieved only original flavors.  I will not recommend this seller and will never order from them again!"
1,"It's cheap. For about 18 bucks, you get 52 packets of oatmeals.<br />I usually take three packets of these each morning."
0,"I like the large variety of oatmeal but less that a week after purchasing this on Amazon (with Amazon Prime) for $18.59 on March 20th, I went to Costco and found the same exact product for $9.39. Save your money and buy it somewhere else."
1,This is a quick breakfast and a great value.<br />I usually add a banana or other seasonal fruit along with milk or water
1,"Amazing price compared to the grocery store and a great multi-pack mix. I like adding raisins and dried cranberries to mine, makes a great healthy breakfast. No surprises in this one, we all know what Quaker Oats are."
0,"The box I got is same as I can purchase from Costco but more than double the price, it's crazy.  I gave this a try cause I though this is different variety pack, No, it's just like you can get from Costco but more than double the price. save yourself some money.  This product needs detail information on what's inside."
1,"Those little packets are wonderful for a quick low calorie weekday breakfast. My favorites are the cinnamon&spice, raisin&spice, and the apple. They are so easy to make and I usually have them after my exercise. With the exception of the warehouse stores (Sam's, Costco) it is extremely rare to see the 52 packet boxes."
0,"When I ordered this product there were many more flavors listed such as ""cinnamon roll"" & ""banana bread""....so this is why I ordered.  When it came in the mail it only had 4 flavors.  Cinnamon & Spice, Apples/Cinnamon, Maple Brown Sugar, & original.  I won't be purchasing this again on Amazon."
0,False advertisement here. The variety I received is not what I ordered. If you are out of a particular variety don't send a replacement unless you have contacted the customer for approval. I don't think I would order a bulk variety again. I'll order the individual flavors instead.
1,"The Quaker Instant Oatmeal Variety Pack, 52 Packets offers four different flavors of oatmeal to kick start your day. My box contained 18 packs of Maple & Brown Sugar, 15 packs of Apple Cinnamon, 14 packs of Cinnamon Spice and 5 packs of Original. Overall this is a good selection of a product that I enjoy on almost a daily basis. The flavored oatmeal might be a little sweet for some people, so be careful using this product if you have Diabetes.<br /><br />Please rate this review if you found it helpful."
1,This 52 pack of Quaker Assorted Oatmeal was ordered for a church food pantry. The product arrived quickly and in good condition. This is a great value and the church was happy.
1,"Not much to say here - it's Quaker oatmeal, just in a bigger box than you'd get at the grocery store. My only problem is that there's plain in the box, but that's clearly visible, and I knew it when I bought it. I just wish they offered a big box without plain flavor."
0,"Good product, but this price is beyond stupid.  It wouldn't cost this much if you bought 6 boxes of the 10 pack at walmart."
1,Tasty oatmeal start for the day. Cooked in the microwave while you get ready for work.
1,"I got a 5lb bag of rolled oats from the farmer's market in Detroit.  Little did I know how hard it was to properly flavor blan oatmeal without adding 2lbs of sugar.  This solved my problem and makes my morning breakfast that much faster - boil, add, stir.  But why did they add like 6 packets of the plain stuff?  The cat won't even eat it."
0,"I bought these after recently being diagnosed as type 2 diabetic.  Probably not the right thing I have found out. They are handy for a quick breakfast.  The taste is not all that great although the texture is much improved over the older product.  Have offered them to other people, but they are not really enthused over the prospect of eating what one called 'wallpaper paste'.  I'm going back to coffee and toast."
1,"The stress of a tough year is starting to get to me. I've been puckered up so tight for so long, I'm afraid my puckerer may have frozen that way.<br /><br />So I've been searching for inner peace -- and outer unpuckering -- in personal relaxation products. But expensive gadgets and doodads would just angry my blood up further, so I'm seeking Samadhi on a shoestring budget.<br /><br />When my wife goes to a spa to relax, she always gets some kind of oatmeal facial scrub treatment. I don't know much about pampering, but I'm intimately familiar with a wide variety of hot breakfast cereals. If oatmeal on the face is relaxing, then I'd sure give it a try.<br /><br />I heated several packets of the oatmeal in the microwave, per the cooking instructions, added a little milk and layered it onto my face. I'm not sure what's supposed to happen next in a 'professional' treatment, but in my bathroom, a lot of it just glooped off into the sink. The rest felt... well, like oatmeal on my face. Sticky. Warm. Lumpy, in a way that was less 'relaxing' and more 'get it off my face-y'.<br /><br />The oatmeal did smell nice, and made me sort of hungry, but I don't think I relieved any stress by putting it on my face instead of IN my face. Maybe next time I'll try wearing it with eggs over easy, or a rasher of bacon. Bacon makes *everything* peaceful."
1,"I bake a lot of bread and cake. This Xanthan Gum is a very fine powder product that emulsifies cakes without changing its color and taste. After using this Xanthan Gum in my bread and sponge cake, the pastries remain moist and fluffy longer."
1,This is a very good product and the cheapest price for a pound that I've seen.  I will be getting from them every time I need some.
1,I see this ingredient on product labels everywhere so I thought I'd check it out. I always liked thick shakes growing up so I thought it might be a way to make a sensible shake or smoothie with the body of a more indulgent drink. Guess what  -  it's amazing! It does the job to the nth degree. With the addition of about half a teaspoon you can make a fat free shake that almost refuses to pour out of the blender. I wouldn't reccommend any more than half a teaspoon to start because you can always add more liquid. I did that and wound up with a full blender full of drink and it was still almost too thick to pour. It's also very popular in salad dressings because it adds body and cling. Home made ice cream is another natural. Try it and discover your own uses.
1,"A must for low carb foodies!  I've used it in baking, making low carb ice cream (which gives the ice cream a real ""mouth"" feel) and thickening sauces without the use of flour or corn starch.  Amazon has the best price on it, too."
1,"I bought this because I was looking for a lower cost alternative to the $12 small bags of Red Mill Xantham gum I had been using to make gluten free bread. I was trying to lower the total cost per loaf, otherwise I might as well buy the loaves in the frozed section which are pretty good. I had already figured out a means to cheaply combine my own flour ingredients so I wouldn't need to purchase the expensive Red Mill gluten free flour. Next, I located on Amazon a great bulk deal on bakers yeast that also added to cost reduction (and was superior in result too.) After buying this Xanthan gum, I further reduced the price per loaf significantly. I have found this product works well and have not noticed any difference in quality of my results with my bread. So, I am very happy to have found this alternative at a more reasonable price. I also like the zip lock bag it comes in which is much more handy for baking and easy handling than the Red Mill bag."
1,"Works like a dream.  This and Guar Gum are the only thickeners I use. This gives my lotions a nice, spreadable quality that makes my lotions feel moist with out being wet or greasy.  Be careful, if you use too much it will clump and leave a slimy feel.  Excellent product.  ""Xanthan Gum! WOW!""  Anyone get that reference? :)~"
1,"I was a bit apprehensive about straying from the familiar Bob's Red Mill brand of gums, but I'm perfectly happy with this product. There's no discernible difference between this and the much-more-expensive BRM brand, so if you know you'll be using xanthan gum often, this is what you'll want to buy. I use some every day and have barely made a dent in my supply!"
1,"I do a lot of gluten free baking and this is such a great deal.  Fresh, effective,and saves us money.  I've purchased this xanthan gum three different times now and the quality and price cannot be beat."
1,"This came well packaged and I found that this gives my yeast breads a longer shelf-life and far moister end product. If you love gooshy white bread, this is THE trick to making it super moist!"
1,This is a great deal for Xanthan gum. I used some of this as a thickening agent during cooking with great results. The re-sealable bag keeps the product good for quite a while (possibly years if you refridgerate it) and I found no observable difference between this brand and other more expensive ones. A little xanthan gum goes a long way and this 1LB bag should last you quite a while.
1,Just restocked after being out for a long time.  I'd forgotten that you need so much less than cornstarch if you are substituting.  Maybe 1/4 as much?  Clumps less than cornstarch as well.
1,"I use Xanthan Gum for my home made lotions, creams and serums to name a few and it works perfectly! You need just a little and that will go a LONG WAY! This will last me forever!"
1,"I grind my own grain and make all of our bread.  I have LITTLE kids and traditional home made bread is pretty coarse and difficult for them to chew, so I tweeked my recipe and added this to my dough to make a lighter textured bread.  This is pretty pricey in the stores here so finding it on Amazon has been a great budget saver.  The quality is great and the packaging convient for storage."
1,"I used this in my Gluten Free baking and it works great!  For St. Patty's day I made my niece Gluten Free Irish Soda Bread using Gluten Free A P Flour, adding 2 teaspoons per cup of flour used and it came out tasting just like the regular bread.  Like I said, it works great, thank you for such a wonderful product, I will be doing a lot more Gluten Free baking."
1,"We have to do a bunch of gluten free baking for my family.  This is the second time I have purchased this exact product.  I was disappointed to see that the cost went up 5$ since last year, but it's still about 7-8$ then purchasing at local retail shops.  This lasted us about 1 year using it for our baked goods."
1,"A little goes a long way. Think baby steps when using, if you aren't using a recipe. I made fruit smoothies, with or without ice."
1,"Ordering through Amazon is the easiest, safest way to order online. I received my order quickly and have never had a problem with an order being shipped incomplete. I order gluten-free products online because the deals are much better than anything found in the local grocery stores. Xanthan gum is costly enough, but you can buy it for less online. The product was fresh, sealed well and performed as expected."
1,Makes my gluten free breads and desserts the absolute best! My bread seems to be nice and tender--not gummy and gluey. Thanks Essential Depot for a great product.
1,I looked around for some a decent price on this stuff. This was the best I could find. It arrived quickly and was just as expected.
1,"I was reluctant to purchase Xanthan Gum, thinking it was too expensive, and frankly, it was a foreign ingredient that I had never used before.  To my absolute delight, I found Xanthan Gum to be an indispensible ingredient in gluten free baking!  It is easy to use, and will last a long time in your pantry.  As any Celiac's patient (or person with gluten sensitivity) will tell you, it's wonderful to bake a Gluten free birthday cake from scratch, with the confidence that everyone will want to eat it!"
1,This is a great product at a great price.  It arrived on time and was packaged well.  I will purchase more when I need it.
1,"Since you are looking into purchasing xanthan gum I assume you know what it does. It acts like it should, and the resealable pouch is very nice."
1,"I have just started using Xanthan Gum in my protein smoothies! A little goes a long way, but the texture of my shakes are now so think and creamy."
1,"I bought this along with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000U6DSSU"">Sunbeam 2591 350-Watt MixMaster, Black</a> to make some bread and cakes.<br /><br />I wasn't too impressed with the mixer but this Xanthan Gum is incredible stuff for the price.<br /><br />It thickens up nicely and gives a great texture.<br /><br />I will be coming back for more."
1,I have used this product all year without any problems (For gluten free baking).  Works great and best price I've found.
0,"This product will cause SEVERE GI distress; even when used in very small amounts.  The gas pains and resulting diarrhea is not worth what it adds to the food product.  I bought it to make home made ice cream smoother.....  forget it!  I'd rather eat ice crystals than go through what my husband and I went through with just 1 tsp. in a quart of mix.  I looked it up on line and this is one of the MAIN side effects and says someone ""may"" tolerate after using for 30 days!  Why would one want to?  Even though the label says it is ""food grade"", the food service that used this product would soon be out of business."
1,Love this and I use in a differnt way my husband can't swallow driniks well and this is a good thicken for that and so much cheater
1,....Use it when you want something a little less tumeric-bright. One stop spicing if you're making a tanjine too. All the moroccan spices I ordered were surprisingly different from each other. So feel free to experiment.
1,I purchased a chi poo last week and this is what they had him on. The first bag 6 6lb was $9.99<br />I purchased another bag while he was being groomed 4 days later this store is 13 miles away so I figured it would be a good idea to grab another bag. Granted nothing in this store is priced for the consumer.Imagine my surprise when I checked my receipt to find I was charged $17.99 plus TAX for the same item i purchased 4 days prior at the same pet store for almost $8.00 LESS. There are only three places I can purchase this. At the pet store or online and the costs are outrageous to say the least. I have found other brands of holistic food at Pet Smart about the same Price. You're paying for the name. Same with IAMS and all the rest. Just how much better is this stuff ? I'm not sure. I know this dog evacuates a lot within minutes after eating it !<br /><br />I shop on Amazon all the time and I was stunned to see this listed at $89.00 for 6 lbs bag marked down to $13 but then they soak ya for shipping which is bringing the total up to $20 for a 6 lb bag. I've seen 25 lb bags for that price. Glad I checked. Think it's time for a food change for this pup !
1,"I first bought this cereal at the HEB grocery store and it's priced between $4 and $5 for 1 box. It taste pretty good. Amazon currently sells it for about $3.95 a box, if you opt for subscribe & save. It's crunchy and takes longer to sog, which is what I like. I don't like Nature's Path Flax Plus Multibran Cereal or Heritage Flakes (not sure which one I tried). It gets soggy too quickly.<br /><br />And if you're curious about the expiration date, all 6 boxes (arrived 2 days ago) are dated for December 2012."
1,"I never smoked,and have all my taste buds intact. This cereal is less sweet then corn flakes or wheaties by a long shot. They really have a multi grain flavor. One thing to note on these boxes,the serving size is small and there are not very many servings per. I suggest buying the bags if you like to eat ,""A real bowl"" not a cup of cereal. It's far more cost effective. I'd give this cereal five stars if all the ingredients came from North America. The cane juice and rice bran flour are from South America."
1,"Nature's Path organic multigrain oatbran flake cereal is a great tasting product and it's very nutritious and friendly to the diet (i.e., very low fat, low sodium, good protein, high fiber content (at least 5 grams by my standard), and low sugar). I've been consuming it for a long time."
1,"Great cereal, always seen in my cupboard. Amazon pricing most fair keeps me coming back."
0,"This used to be my favorite cereal. It had fiber, good taste and texture but in the past year or two they started making it sweeter and sweeter. I don't like sweetened cereal. At least with an unsweetened cereal I can choose to make it sweeter myself. But if it is too sweet out of the box there is no choice to make it less sweet. I contacted the company and told them I didn't like how sweet they had made it now. They denied that they had changed anything. They lost me as a customer after that. I was buying 6 boxes a month for almost 2 years straight. I stopped. I waited a few months and decided to try again to see if they had changed their recipe back the way it used to be. I just opened a new box and it is still sickening sweet for my tastes. Goodbye Nature's Path. If I wanted super sweetened sugar cereal that is what I would have bought! Anybody want free 6 boxes? You can have it!!! Yuck!"
1,"Do you like ginger? Are you aware of it's health-giving qualities?  Ginger has been shown to settle the digestion, to act as an anti-inflammatory, and may even shrink tumors and inhibit cancer cells. I've seen this specific product recommended in various articles on Naturopathic health. It TASTES healthy. It tastes great, too.<br /><br />Ginger Beer (as opposed to Ginger Ale) is loaded with ginger. And it's rarely more loaded with ginger than here in REED'S EXTRA GINGER BREW---At 26 grams per bottle, you can practically SEE the ginger in it. It has a lot of ginger ""bite.""<br /><br />Unlike the soft drink megacorporations which produce a tasteless and overly fizzy sugar water they label as ""Ginger Ale"", Reed's microbrews it's soft drinks in a process similar to that used by a beer microbrewery. There is no alcohol in REED'S EXTRA GINGER BREW. 25% of REED's EXTRA is fruit juice, part of which contributes to the sugar content, which is comparable to other sodas. REED'S should be a treat, not a substitute for water.<br /><br />REED'S GINGER BREW comes in three varieties, ORIGINAL, PREMIUM, and EXTRA. The amount of ginger increases with each variety (It's a little odd that PREMIUM has less ginger than EXTRA). The labels are similar so check carefully to decide which variety you want."
1,"I've had ""ginger ale"" as a soft drink off and on throughout my life, both the regular and the diet varieties. It was okay. Then I spotted Reed's Extra Ginger Brew (all natural Jamaican Ginger Beer) in my local Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. What is this, I wondered? Well, looked it over and decided I just had to try it. Oh, my! It was good! Really good! It was so superior to the ""ginger ales"" I've had that there was just no comparison. And this drink tasted like real ginger and it  was good and strong! Boy, this is a fine soft drink. A bottle has just about the same calories as regular soda and I note 37 grams of sugar. I'm going to have to watch it. This stuff goes down so easy!<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
1,"I like this. Sometimes I even love it, like - when it's a furnace outside and the ginger beer is ice cold. But it's not the best I've had. If you want a very gingery beer, try The Ginger People. They infuse their beer with real pieces of ginger - ginger that you can see. Fever-Tree offers a nice, refreshing ginger beer as well."
1,I fell in love with Reed's Ginger Beer Extra Ginger Brew years nearly 20 years ago. I may not be an expert on ginger beer but I know what I like and it is Reeds!
1,"I Love ginger ANYTHING..  This is a non alcoholic brew that offers two strengths of ginger. I prefer the 26 gram bottle. Snappy and bubbly.  It's my ""eye opener"" in the morning . Once you get hooked , you'll miss it when it's gone.  So, I buy 2 cases (48) bottles at a time.  Also is used for goosed up coctails in trendy bars. Try something different and give yourself the benefits of ginger in your life. Mildly spicy with a Jamaican flare. Twist off cap, so bring it with you.  If I have a little stomach queeze, this drink will fix the problem."
1,This bubbly crisp ginger ale has an excellent strong ginger bite to it. There is no sugary taste to it like far too many ginger ales on the market. There is just a hint of honey to this lovely concoction. The crispness of all of Reed's Ginger Ales is incredibly refreshing on a hot summer day. Try it over ice cream for a ginger ale float!
1,"Seriously, if you have a stomach ache and drink a bottle of this, it will go away.  I started drinking ginger ale a few years ago because I had stomach problems and read that ginger helps as does peppermint tea.  It both does indeed help, but when I found this I became hooked.  I drink one every day and have no more upset stomach, ever!  I love this stuff and don't understand the bad reviews.  I have tried some of those other brands people are mentioning and they really don't taste any better.  It's funny how someone always has to come along and slam something good and tell you how to do it better.  This is my favorite of all the gingers I've tried.  Get a bottle ice cold and drink it and you will love it."
1,"Trader Joe's consistently has the best price on this, barely under $1/bottle. This has got to be about my favorite beverage. I am surprised to see any negative reviews. This does not taste like Ginger Beer. Ginger beer has more bite and is very sugary. This is much more refreshing, but it also has a bite, not much, but enough."
1,This ginger beer is really good. It is not as aromatic as some of the others which is one of the reasons I like it. I usually buy it for about a dollar a piece at the local grocery store. Can't beat that anywhere.
1,This item was a gift for a relative. They were so overjoyed that I was showered with compliments. Now that we have the order straight I expect to conduct further business with Amazon in the future. Thanks.
0,"Reed's is probably the most well known brand of premium ginger beer on the market, but it is a mediocre beverage by itself and as a mixer. Even the Extra Ginger doesn't pack much of a ginger punch. I would give it 1 star, but it's better than Canada Dry and uses doesn't use HFCS. I prefer Natural Brew Outrageous Ginger Ale for drinking by itself or as a mixer and Gosling's as a mixer only, although Gosling's contains HFCS."
0,"While certainly not as awful as Ginger People's ginger beer, I don't recommend it.  I love a good ginger beer, and this is all that my local grocery store carries and I still won't buy it.  To be fair, there are different styles of ginger beer and taste IS subjective.  But I can't help but feeling that something like Cock and Bull or Barritts is MUCH better and more ""authentic"".  (Although they are not nearly as natural.)"
0,"Trader Joe's discontinued Bundaberg but kept this line. Go figure. Exotic label, bland taste. Bundaberg is one of the best I've ever tasted. Reed's: forgettable."
0,"I have been searching for a good ginger beer, trying to find something that might compare to Bundaberg Ginger Beer, and was EXTREMELY disappointed with Reed's.  I was looking for that sweet gingery flavor, with a nice strong bite, and found Reed's to be nothing more than a bland drink with a lingering burn, NOT a bite, that resembled heartburn more than the gingery spice blast of a decent ginger beer.  Reed's was rubbery tasting, and tastes similar to a cheap non-alcoholic beer.  I literally couldn't finish my first bottle.  I pride myself on being able to eat and drink just about anything... so to be unable to finish this drink says a lot.  Oh Bundaberg, why aren't you sold in US grocery stores???"
1,"We found these wonderful treats in Scotland a few years back. Since they're 95% dried fish, our terriers went nuts for them. (The tiddler size is perfect for smaller dogs.) They were difficult to locate in this country, so every time we went back to the UK we would stock up. Now that Entirely Pets features them, life is perfect..."
0,"While I agree that these nuts are quite tasty, the total weight of the eight packs is one pound. Thats $26.00 per pound for cashews! I can buy fresh-roasted spiced cashews at the local gourmet nut shop for half that and see them roasted right in front of me!"
1,I tried these nuts at the Food Network's Food and Wine Festival and become a fan. The unique flavor of the Indonesian spices are unforgettable. A must try item for those cashew lovers!
1,What a really great product! All the flavors from this company are delicious! (I'm lucky enough to have tried them all!) The cashews are amazing quality and the recipes reeeaally pack some flavor - these are anything BUT bland! Love the convenient vacuum seal packs...prevents you from having to open a whole jar - everything stays fresh. Much better than your normal snack mix!!
1,"These cashews are so delicious! They are fresh, full of flavor, and packaged for easy to-go activities. Helping Indonesian farmers produce a quality product is an added benefit. They are a great snack to get you through a Pilates or yoga routine."
1,This is the best bargain for green tea and the jasmine adds a bit of sweetness to it. I drink it every morning.
1,"As a connoisseur of fine green tea's, it's my option that is brand is the tops!  Hot or cold the balance of green tea and Jasmine is perfect!  And how can you argue with the price for this box..?  Great job Legends.  Bravo Amazon for carrying this!!!"
1,"I am so excited!  I haven't been able to find this double black soy sauce since (I worked in Boston) I shopped at the markets in Chinatown on the outskirts of downtown Boston.  The flavor of this soy sauce really makes my dishes, especially my pork lo mein, taste authentic (I guess I mean as it tasted in the restaurant).  Go easy though, the flavor is intense!  Thank you, Amazon, for carrying these wonderful imported treasures."
1,The soy sauce I received is wonderful.  It is full-bodied and worked well when making Hot and Sour Soup.  Thank you.
1,"For those who does not like the bones in sardines, Kippers are good alternative.  This one in tomato sauce suits my palate.  The one in grocery stores are all smoked brand, so if you like it plain, this is it!"
1,"For some reason, they sent me the ""mini"" small swedish fish. Not the regular sized ones as I was led to believe. However it was still a 5 lb bag and the candy is good tasting so I've taken off 1 star for that order error"
1,"This is a delicious, light tea.  Try putting a few fresh mint sprigs in when the water comes to a boil but before drinking, also it tastes good with a little simple syrup."
1,"I have had cats for over 50 years, and this is the best litter I've ever used.  I currently have three cats (including one 20-lb guy who can urinate till the cows come home) and find this litter absolutely wonderful in controlling odor. I have switched litter brands over the years every time something ""better"" comes along.  Now I just pray that this one will never go away.  I've been using it for about a year and am thankful I was convinced by some of the online reviews to give it a try.  Best decision I ever made where cats are concerned."
1,"This is the best cat litter ever. It destroys odors better than any other cat litter I have used.  When my<br />friends come over to my house, they always tell me that you can't tell that I even have cats.  There is no cat litter box odors lingering in the air.  One of my friends said that her sister has a cat and you could always get a strong scent of the cat litter box when you would walk into her house.  My friend asked me what cat litter I used so she could share with her sister.  I told her it was scoop away plus crystals and that it was the best stuff.  She shared the information with her sister.  Her sister started using scoop away and she was so pleased that she uses nothing but scoop away.  I know my cats love it and so do I.  It clumps well and it has a nice fresh clean scent.  You won't be sorry if you switch over from you present litter to scoop away.  It's the best."
1,I find this is the best litter for controlling odor.  Many of the stores have discontinued this product and since I feel it us the best available I order it online
1,Have been using this litter for 9 years. It is the best litter on the market. It used to be carried at Petco and Petsmart but no longer carried within the last year as they have their own proprietary blends of crystal litter. Very glad that Amazon is now carrying it with $0 shipping after $25 spend.  The crystals absorb all the odors.  I have tried other blends of Scoop Away including multicat and fresh scent as well as Arm & Hammer and this one is superior by far. I wouldn't use anything else!
0,"I used Fresh Step and Scoop Away cat litters for many years and was quick to tell any of my cat owner friends that they were the best ""bang for the buck"" litters. They clumped hard, making the chore of cleaning the cat box a relatively easy one. Sometime around 6 months ago, that all changed. Now, they form a sludge in the cat box that is nearly impossible to scrape out. The amount of effort necessary to clean the box could easily induce a muscle strain or hernia for those unfortunate enough to purchase one of these litters. Both products are made by the Clorox Pet products Co. Consider yourself warned!"
1,"These salted Season kipper snacks are almost as good as the non-salted, but not as good. There's no saltiness that gets in the way of the herring flavor, but somehow the full herring flavor doesn't come through the way it does with the non-salted version. Of course, if you prefer salted herring, this would be the best for you, although the salt certainly does not dominate. For me, I hardly notice it. That may be good or bad for you. But ordering this by the case from Amazon costs less and is more convenient than buying it at the grocery store if you use a lot of it--and with all of the omega 3's in this, you should use it a lot. A painless way of getting a lot of omega 3's."
1,"been eating seasons for years but the local supermarkets seem to only have 4 or 5 cans or none on the shelves...the delivery  here is prompt the supplier adequate...3 cans in a pan, butter old bay lemon juice and fry  'em up delicious breakfast...if only i didnt have to get spam mail from amazon asking me to buy things...this would be perfect"
1,"We tried to get kippers on subscribe-and-save, but reviewers on the products we looked at mentioned that the pull ring frequently broke off the can, making it impossible to open without a separate can opener.  Not what we wanted!!<br /><br />So we tried these -- which are a win!!  My husband loves them.  He says the taste is excellent, and the price is terrific, too, because there are 24 per case -- 6 more than other brands, he says.  And he has had no problem whatever opening the cans, which was what motivated us to try these in the first place.<br /><br />Motto:  subscribe and save is fabulous, but sometimes something not on subscribe and save is even better!  :)  And many, many thanks to reviewers of the other products who alerted us to the problem opening those cans."
1,"Very tasty, handy protein snack unfortunately the all ingredients are listed per Sunbutter : Sunflower Seed, Evaporated Cane Syrup, Salt, and Natural Mixed Tocopherols to preserve freshness."
1,Sunbutter tastes great and is a great way to get some much needed calories in to our preschooler's diet.  I'm so glad that they made these little portable packets!
1,"We ordered the Sunbutter Sunflower Seed Spread On the Go Pouches because we were traveling with a 5 year old grandson who has allergies to peanuts.  He regularly eats Sunbutter and loves it.  The convenience of these travel pouches was terrific.  The amount in each pouch easily provided one sandwich, the size made packing easy and convenient.  They helped to make our 15 day European trip worry-free.  I highly recommend them."
1,"The On the Go Pouch is just perfect! My food allergic children carry these in their backpacks in case plans change and they don't have access to safe foods.  We also keep a supply in their lockers and classrooms in the event of a school lock down, where each classroom is locked down no one can exit or enter the classroom (sometimes for hours).  They are perfect for school earthquake kits too for states that require a kit for each student.  I can't rave enough for the convenience, taste and ease of mind in case of emergencies!"
1,Perfectly packaged. I take these to the gym to have as an after-workout pick me up. Protein and fat and just a little sugar. Marvelous.
1,The sunbutter travel packs are so convenient and yummy. Not messy. I take when traveling as I No longer eat peanuts.<br />I got the creamy in the packs. I prefer the crunchy in the jars.
1,Great for road trips and dealing with peanut allergies.  It's a great idea that I've been looking for when traveling for quite some time now.  Really great!
1,"Because of finding this in GoPicnic meals from Amazon, we searched this item excited to have a case.  It's good but didn't expect it to expire in just a few months.  We have 3 cases now...  I know you can get better expiration dates than that so was disappointed and took off a star.  Otherwise it's a great alternative to peanut butter and from what we've heard so far...better for you."
1,"My dog is 16 now and has always been a finicky eater, it has always been hard to find things she likes, but these are one of her favorites! They are also so healthy. She has also always had itchy skin in the late summer to fall, I found these treats last fall and this past summer her skin was so much better, hardly any itching. I would recommend them. Be sure to read the directions though, the amount you give your dog is recommended by their weight. They are also good for dogs if they tend to eat grass."
1,"My wife and I share our home with the Three Muske-Terriers: A male Westie, a male Cesky and, the Empress-of-All-She-Surveys, a female Scotty. The Empress is alergic to wheat, (along with corn and soy), so I had my doubts concerning Pet Greens Roasted Chicken Recipe w/ Wheat Grass Dog Treats - wheat grass after all is just ""juvenile"" wheat. But apparently not to worry! We're half way through our first bag and no allergic reaction, (you haven't lived until you've seen a crazed Scotty in the middle of an allergic frenzy chewing on her tootsies). Now, putting aside her allergies, the Empress will eat almost anything - and so will the Cesky. But the Westie gives new meaning to the term ""finicky"" - and Asta gives these treats five barks - I mean, stars. So what's up here?<br /><br />The treats are mostly roasted chicken meal, supplemented with dried chicory extract, organic ground wheat grass powder, lecithin, salt, cultured whey and garlic, preserved with ""mixed tocopherols,"" (I'm not a chemist, but I think that's a fancy name for vitamin E, sourced from vegetable oil). The wheat grass doesn't contain any wheat glutten - which I think is the reason it doesn't trigger the Empress' allergies. Wheat grass is an excellent source of any and all of the nutrients contained in fresh vegetables.<br /><br />The treats are small ""jerky-like"" rectangles - no more than an inch by 3/4s of an inch, and maybe 1/16 of an inch thick, (they may be more appropriate for small to medium size dogs - a large dog would want three or four at a time). They're great for a quick reward and at only about 4 calories a piece, there's not much danger that your dog is going to put on unwanted pounds, (however I wouldn't suggest that you carry them loose in your pocket or purse - they smell strongly of garlic - I keep 'em in a zip lock baggie).<br /><br />As far as I can tell, the ingrediants are all natural, but only the wheat grass is organic - if you are interested in organic treats, I suggest that you check out those made by Wagatha or Robbie Dawg.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I think that Pet Greens offers both a change of flavor and a change in texture from most common dog treats. The Three Muske-Terriers are scarfing 'em down - your furry buddy probably will too."
1,"I was looking for a product that is not made in China, contains mostly meat and does without a long list of unhealthy ingredients. Having older rescued dogs with very few teeth, the treats also needed to be soft enough for them to chew. Pet Greens Treats fulfilled all of these requirements. The dogs aren't crazy about them, but will eat them. With all the dubious treats coming from China, this is a good choice."
1,It took my dogs a minute the very first time I gave them these. But after they sniffed it for the first time and ate it. They were hooked. Now if my dog even sees the bag he starts drooling. They just love them! I just wish they were a little more affordable...
1,This is a favorite of Boxer and Rottie.  It has a pleasant aroma and is soft.  On long walks it is great when I need a rest.  I intend to buy it again.  Mixed with dry Iams it adds a flavorable extra.
1,I purchased these for a friend who has a dog and he told me that his little doggie loved them!! Thank you!
0,"Product was advertised as Porcini Powder.  The product that we received was labelled 'Dried Mushroom Powder.' It looked greyish rather than the richer cinnamon-brown color of porcini powders that I have purchased in the past from another company.  More importantly, tasted/smelled like ""watered down"" porcini, not 100% porcini.  Looks like a 'bait and switch' to me and we will definitely not order again."
1,"This porcini powder tastes wonderful. It adds a deep richness and depth to tomato sauces and especially any type of Italian recipe. It's concentrated so don't use a ton at once. Has that distinctive mushroom smell when you open the top, but adds sooo much flavor to my cooking. Great in soups, too!"
1,"This mushroom powder is great with pasta, on popcorn, on pizza - anything, really. So glad I found it.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/143274903X"">Use Wine to Make Sense of the World</a>"
1,"Very happy with this powder. I sue it when I want to add richness to soups, stocks, stews, whatever. A little bit adds a subtle amount of umami and richness (not necessarily identifiable by most as mushroom flavor), and if you use more the mushroom flavor is more pronounced. It doesn't take much to really enhance whatever you put it in."
1,What a great product to have for adding that extra mushroomy taste to many recipes.  Great in soups and sauces.  Also great in burgers and meatloafs.
1,"This sauce has a great Mexican taste beyond its peppery fire, and the bold color, even though created by dyes, is just plain fun to look at. The splash of red on fresh veggies, lettuce, and other dishes is a treat for the eye as well as the palette. A little salty and acidic, its bright flavor goes great with finished Mexican dishes if you want to kick them up, as well as in soups, beans, chili, and added to salsa when you think it needs a little heat. This sauce is not incredibly hot as some are (the kind that work better as dares, really, or can only be taken in a very diluted form), but it's not for the babies either.<br /><br />It's just right for most people, who like some spice, and putting it on the table lets you make milder dishes, and let the individual diners decide how spicy they want it; likewise, it helps you make those Mexican dishes spicier and tastier if you want to cook with the sauce. The price is great--just over a dollar per bottle, but the large quantity works better for restaurants than individual use."
1,"I've tried MANY hot sauces, and NOTHING COMPARES TO THIS. Flavor, heat, color, this is my favorite hot sauce of all time. Try it, you'll agree!"
1,Great flavor I just can't get enough.  One of the bottles broke in shipping though. Amazon can't seem to package heavy items properly those plastic bags justy don't cut it.  The sauce has a great flavor and adds the right amount of heat.  I like it hot.  If you are really insane they make a xxx verson also.  This one works for me though.
1,"I have tried many recipes for gluten free bread. Most of these recipes claim to be the ""best I have ever tasted,"" or ""Can't tell from regular bread."" Nonsense! Soggy, dry, crumbly, tasteless, or weird tasting is more like it. One recipe from Australia turned purple!. So, I didn't have high expectations for my latest recipe made with white bean flour. Surprise! The gluten free bread made with the white bean flour is my most successful bread so far. No one would mistake it for regular bread, but it is light, toasts well, and doesn't crumble. I will be ordering more white bean flour."
1,"I have no complaint about the product itself, but when I ordered it it said there were 6 (24oz.) bags. When I received it there were only 4. Now I see that it has been changed on your site to say 4, but it DID say 6 when I ordered it!!"
1,"I'm always looking for a good source of fiber, Almond meal, coconut flour, any thing that gives me 3 g or more fiber, and this work horse is it, 6 big grams of it. I add it to pancake and or waffles, soups, breads, you just name it and it will fit right in."
1,"Great food. My dog prefers this to Blue Buffalo, and I find the ingredients and quality to be comparable. I used to sell Blue Buffalo, so I know the value of good pet food. My decision to switch really comes down to my dog eating this more regularly."
1,My dog loooooves this  we live in uzbekistan so being here we are nervous about feeding him local dog food. even if the package says purina. so when i found this online i was happy it had other great reviews. he seems to have normal stool which is what we def wanted. his fur is super soft he does have dry skin but i think thats because we have to wash him with people shampoo ( cant ship that out here) cant wait to be stateside :-) enjoy the product its great
1,"We love this food for our dog, his coat has a lot of improvement and his allergies are way better now that he switched to this food, we used to use large breed Science Diet and Nutro and they dont even compare to this food.  We even feed this to our little terrier dog as well as our Mastiff with the problems.  Definately recommend this food!"
1,My daughter has a Saint Bernard named Julius Ceasar but we call him Ju Ju.  He is a gentle giant indeed.  Castor and Pollux Large Breed dog food is his favorite by far.  I save 15% through subscribe and save and have it delivered monthly for free.  Terrific!!
1,"After switching my cats from Iams to Castor & Pollux, we decided that it was the dog's turn.  Our big dogs (100lbs & 110lbs) had been eating Iams large breed for about 3 years.  Even though Iams is considered a premium food, our concerns were:<br /><br />(1)  the second ingredient is corn meal and one of the proteins is chicken by-product meal (Chicken by-product meal consists of the ground, rendered, clean parts of the carcass of slaughtered chicken, such as necks, feet, undeveloped eggs and intestines, exclusive of feathers, except in such amounts as might occur unavoidable in good processing practice);<br />(2) Our dogs were putting on weight despite the fact that they are active, high energy dogs; and<br />(3) An  olfactory-related concern - when resting, the dogs passed gas - a lot of gas!<br /><br />The gas got us.  Even though Castor & Pollux is a more expensive dog food, we decided that it was worth a try.  Forty-five pounds of dog food later, I'm happy that we switched because the dogs love the food, their coats are healthy, they are active and seem to be slimming down, and, best of all, the gas issue is no longer an issue.<br /><br />Since this information isn't listed on the Amazon product page, and since ingredients are a main consideration when purchasing pet food, Castor& Pollux Large Breed ingredients are (from the back of the bag):<br /><br />Chicken, Chicken Meal, Brewers Rice, Ground Whole Grain Barley, Oat Groats, Turkey Meal, Chicken Fat Preserved with Mixed Tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), Dried Carrots, Dried Bananas, Dried Apples, Fish Meal, Dried Egg Product, Brewers Dried Yeast, Natural Chicken Flavor, Ground Flaxseed, Cultured Whey, Monocalcium Phosphate, Potassium Chloride, Salt, Chicken Cartilage, Dried Papayas, Dried Blueberries, Vitamin E Supplement, Zinc Sulfate, Ferrous Sulfate, L-Ascorbyl-2-Polyphosphate (source of Vitamin C), Zinc Oxide, Choline Chloride, Zinc Proteinate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Proteinate, L-Carnitine, Niacin, Copper Sulfate, Vitamin A Supplement, Biotin, Calcium Pantothenate, Manganous Oxide, Thiamine Mononitrate (source of Vitamin B1), Vitamin K1 Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (source of Vitamin B6), Riboflavin Supplement (source of Vitamin B2), Vitamin B12 Supplement, Sodium Selenite, Calcium Iodate, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Folic Acid, Cobalt Caronate, Yeast Culture (Saccharomyces Cerevisiae), Dried Enterococcus Faecium Fermentation Product, Dried Lactobacillus Acidophilus Fermentation Product, Dried Aspergillus Niger Fermentation Extract, Dried Trichoderma Longibrachiatum Fermentation Extract, Dried Bacillus Subtilis Fermentation Extract and Fermentation Solubles.<br />Each bag has a Best if Used by Date, and comes with an Unconditional Guarantee from the manufacturer.<br /><br />Our final decision is to stick with this food.  Our dogs love it & we love the results.  Highly Recommended."
1,"My Lab's 12 yrs old, and her coat had become dry, dull and she was shedding handfuls every day. This is all I feed her now as daily kibble, and she's silky, shiny, hardly sheds at all. She's also slimmer, perkier, more playful. Combined with Voltage (sold here on Amazon, good price too) to deal with stiffening failing hips, it's like she's years younger. [ASIN:B000K7J8GU Bio-Kinetics Voltage for Companion Animals, 1 Jar]] If her fur didn't have so much white hair, no one would believe she's over 7 or 8.<br /><br />Once my delivery arrived w/the bag torn. Amazon replaced it, free. I love the service on Amazon!["
1,"Great dog food shipped to my door monthly. My boxer enjoyed the food from day one. Great amount of meat, fruit and veggies!"
1,"My 125 pound Rescue Cane Corso has been thriving on C&P for the three yearws that I've had him.  The vet -- on his ""rgular"" visits (no emergencies to date) -- often compiments me on his beautiful silky coat. . . . .The price is reasonable too -- although I wish it cost less. . . . .I LOVE the delivery service.  Purchased, of course, through Amazon."
1,"We have a big black dumb Great Dane named Otis. Otis is six years old.  We switched him from Eagle Pack Large Breed to Castor & Pollux due to the availability of Eagle Pack in our geographic location and price.  After eight months on this feed, I have no negative feedback on the product.  Otis's elephant-sized poos are firm and he loves the stuff (I suspect he'd eat just about anything though). His hair coat is shinny and energy level is sufficient.<br />*Otis approved review*<br />JB"
1,My dogs love this food. My older shepard would have runny poop alot but since we switched to this food about a year ago it stays solid and she is happier.
1,"Made in the USA, has fruit and vegetable pieces you can see. If you are subcribe n save, it will cost you less than buying it in the store. Additionally it comes to your front door so you don't have to lift it in the store, to your car, to your house, etc"
1,"This dog food's ingredient list definitely makes you feel better feeding it to your dog, but I do notice ours are really gassy after eating it.  Not sure why that is.  They have been eating it for months, so it isn't just the transition to new food.  Maybe all the veggies?  I also notice that they do not digest the carrot pieces at all.  But a natural food is way better than what they used to eat, so we are sticking with it for now."
1,"Although I do love Castor and Pollux Organix marketed items for my dog. If you prefer your dog be on organic, this food is not. It's ""natural"". Natural Ultramix. Considering the level of ingredients, it's not near it. The Organix one equal to this has more Red on it. But it's up to the individual, their pets needs, and the level of income to what they can afford :)"
1,"It was a gift for my dad, he hasn't seen this extract in 30+ years.<br />He is enjoying it very much.<br />Thank you."
1,Excellent service for this very hard to find product.<br /><br />Thank you so much.
0,What is it really?  I'm not going to purchase it unless there is clarification.  Plastic bottle?  Black Walnut extract is too precious to waste in a plastic container.
0,"The picture on your ad is not a black walnut.  It is an english walnut.Though I have not tried your black walnut flavoring, showing an english walnut might be confusing for the consumer."
1,"I bought this extract for my parents because they could no longer by it at their local grocery store.  They were so pleased that I was able to find it on Amazon. Thank you, Andrea G."
0,"It doesn't taste like walnuts, plain and simple. It tastes like paper glue loaded with alcohol. And I got heartburns afterwards. Who knows what is in this. I really regret buying this, what a waste of money."
0,I had to put in a rating or it would not have taken my review...I have never used this product so it may be a good flavoring...I just wanted to clarify the picture.  It is not a picture of a black walnut....it is a picture of an English walnut...there is a big difference.......I was looking for a fine black walnut flavoring....
0,"This product is packaged in plastic bottles.  I buy all of my spices, extracts, etc. in glass containers only. I would not have ordered this had I known it was shipped in plastic bottles. Because the price was low, we discarded the un-opened plastic bottles rather than try to return them."
0,The peas are way too salty to eat I talked to the owner she did't care about the condition of the peas.
1,"These taste like a fruit roll up with bits of crunchy seeds in them. Overall really good, though a bit too sweet for me (I don't like fruit roll ups for the same reason). I gave one to a coworker and she loved them so much she went right online and ordered some. I didn't notice it curbing my hunger at all, but it'd be a good snack if you were craving something sweet."
1,"I wasn't sure how these would be, I'm looking for something that my kids can grab in the morning if they are in a rush or just an after school snack. I ordered one in each flavor cut them in 4ths and the kids went nuts! They loved them! So I'm ordering cases of them now! Yes a little pricey, but I would rather spend extra money and know they are getting a healthy snack!"
1,After trying one bar I went back and ordered an entire box!  These are very tasty just like the Fruit leather/strips you can get at Target or the Health Food store but with some crunch (aka Chia Seeds) but they taste amazing.
1,I agree with the other review.  I didn't know how this might taste but I was suprised how delicious it was - going to order lots more.
0,"The shipping on these fruit chia bars was very fast but it wasn't free. The mailman left me a little envelope saying I owed him<br />85 cents! Also, I thought these were sugar free but the lable says there's 23 grams of sugar! Also, the flavor wasn't that great. I won't be buying these fruit chia bars again."
1,"The chicken freeze dried medallions are great!  My cat loves these and goes nuts whenever he hears the bag open.<br /><br />The freeze dried medallions are only labelled for supplemental feeding, as they have not underwent feeding trials (per the customer service at Nature's Variety).  I tend to use these as a treat, or mix with the raw or Instinct canned.<br /><br />Serving is very simple.  Add warm water to rehydrate, wait about a minute and done.  You can also crumble to add over the top of other foods.  Storage is simple as well as the pouch has a zipper closure at the top.<br /><br />Customer service at Nature's Variety is also very helpful."
1,"I think this tea has a lovely light taste to it.  It's a bit on the pricey side so I just have it a few times a week and drink a cheaper brand daily.  I was introduced to this brand during my visit to Jordan, Amman and was happy to find it on Amazon."
1,"I really enjoy this tea. It's a simple Jasmine Green Tea, but the luxury bags and the quality that went into the presentation is really admirable. The price is pretty good for two tins of 20 quality tea and bags. So all in all this was worth the price."
1,I ordered the green tea and the cinnamon flavor one.  I savor the flavor everytime I have them.  I have them after lunch at work and then some nights when I need something soothing.  I would highly recommend the quality.  The packaging is impressive -- maybe overdone unless it contributes to its freshness.  Highly recommend it.
1,Most wonderful tea - aroma is out of this world. It is a medium bodied tea which brings in all the health benefits of pure Green tea and naturally imparts fragrance and distinctive flavor of the Jasmine flower. The  triangular mesh bags allows large leaf teas to be used and to brew better. A great refreshing tea after a strong tasting or rich food.<br /><br />Great gift idea for tea lover!
1,"Dilmah Green Tea is a medium-bodied tea, with only a little bitterness. The Jasmine flavor is not very pronounced, but I like the combination. (Overall, it is a good tea for around 4.00 a can. I used the promotional discount)"
1,"When we first buy this, we want to make the soup, but actually we just eat as it after opening. it taste good even without cooking. we like the texture. now we use it for salads as well. So definitely a five starts."
1,These are great mushrooms and you can't find them in the stores.  A bit pricey though which is the reason for the four stars instead of five.
1,I love G2 and for a while I was buying it by the case. I stopped buying it just because of how much waste it creates. Then I saw that there were little packets available and I immediately bought a bunch. No change in taste or anything! Yay for G2!
1,The small size pouches are perfect for taking backpacking & pouring into the water packs when needed.<br />Also I travel a lot & prefer Gatorade over any of the airline drinks. These tiny packs are perfect for that.<br />I have happily given up on buying the gatorade bottles because I always have these packs handy!
1,My son-in-law recently was deployed overseas and these are the perfect size to slip into any care package we are sending. The individual packets are also easy for him to carry out in the field.
0,"Dear Gatorade:<br /><br />Biggest fan of the G2 powder pack!  I have bought hundreds of these boxes in the last 18 months!  Tastes great, less filling!  Boxes stack neatly in the pantry!  No more boxes???  G2 in my store now comes in a slippery plastic cylindrical tube (for more money).  Doesn't stack in the pantry.  Yeah, it's still Gatorade G2 powder, but it's a pain in the posterior.  Packages teeter-totter on the shelf and fall all over the place.  Why do companies like yours screw up a good thing?  Did you feel you needed to make your product look all spacey-agey and better than the other box powders?  Have you tried to put this on your own pantry shelf?  I gave this 2 stars only because it used to be a perfect product.  I've reluctantly moved on to Propel."
1,These are dry biscuits that my dog likes a lot. I expected them to be soft; but they are dry like dry dog food. They are easy to crunch for my dog. My dog is about a hundred pounds and these biscuits work good as training treats which are easy to handle and use. My dog likes them; so I'm glad that I bought them. I had used the soft varsions of Natural Balance training treats (chicken and beef ) about a year ago with good results; I had to cut those up into smaller sizes where as these biscuits are at a good size now for immediate use.
1,"I bought this product because my daughter had a hard time with all the other formulas except Enfamil Gentlease.  I had to quit breastfeeding due to some medicine I was taking and did not want to pay $50.00 every two weeks for two cans of Enfamil formula.  I had used a formula by the same company with my first daughter (it is the same as the Babies R' Us brand) and knew that the quality was great and dependable.  Also, it had all the same ingredients as Enfamil Gentlease.  So to me it is a matter of do I want to pay around $25.00/ 24oz just so I can have something name brand or do I want to pay $16.00/ 24oz have all the same benefits of Enfamil Gentlease at a much cheaper price...Well, go figure I decided to save money!  I love this formula, it mixes well, she loves the taste, it is nutritionally complete, and with all the things you already have to buy for baby, why not save a little money when every little bit helps."
1,These pretzles are delicious! As a new member of the gluten free club I will say that I have been missing pretzles and these satisfy my pretzle craving. They are more on the crunchy side and have a faint taste of butter which I love. My kids who are not gluten free love them and I have to fight them off my pretzles. I like the 100 calorie size as I can grab and go when in a hurry.
1,"The price of coffee has been rising, and I am addicted (or at least used to) this brand of coffee.  This pack will keep me in coffee for a while - and at a great price."
0,"product was broken [???] could not be delivered,other item on order never arrived.called customer service and also told them<br />that my credit card # had been hacked and I knew it was from this company.no interest at all or concern at what I was telling them.<br />Would never order again from amazon."
1,I love the taste of the Republic of Tea teas and I love the fact that they are surgar free! A win win for me!
1,"I have tried a few other ""sleepy"" teas. None worked. This tea is wonderful. You better be ready for bed because within a half hour you'll be heading there. The flavor is supreme. And the smell is heavenly and relaxing in it self. Highly recommend for those occasional sleepless nights. But wouldn't recommend if you had to drive somewhere. Gave it to my daughter who never sleeps and she even got good results."
1,"Great Chamomile Lemon Tea.<br />Whole Foods charged too much for Republic of Tea, so Amazon to the rescue.<br />It is a ""calming"" tea, but if you have tasted other Chamolile tea and haven't liked it, this may be the answer. I love it."
1,"These are the first snacks and finger foods I ever gave to my daughter. I was so scared of her choking on anything that I thought I would wait till she's 1 or longer... and then I came across HappyMelts Yogurt Melts and I totally felt in love with them. They melt in her mouth quickly and they are delicious. I've tried all 3 of them: Mixed Berry, Strawberry and Banana and I have to tell you they are all different.<br />Mixed Berry - purple, very flat oval shaped, very easy and quick melts, very sweet<br />Strawberry - pink, very hard acorn shaped (like little Hershey kisses), chunkier and melts not as quick, not as sweet<br />Banana- yellow, softer acorn shaped (like little Hershey kisses), chunky but they melt quickly<br />I thought there was something wrong with all strawberry ones, as they seem to be really hard, but I guess that's the way they are. Mixed Berry is my baby's favorite and I love them too :)"
1,My 8 month old loves these yogurt melts.  They are super easy to dissolve and taste amazing.  The fact that they are organic and support Project Peanut Butter in Africa is a plus.
1,"Son loves these, these actually taught him how to chew. We thought he didn't like them at first, but after a few tries he was not afraid of them anymore (these were his first non-pureed food) and now he crawls to the pak and begs for them and wants lots at a time. These are organic and so much better for kids than Gerber Graduates yogurt melts which contain food coloring and other additives.. We will be re-ordering these very soon!"
0,"I picked these up at the health food store- as the Dr. Sears reccommendation caught my eye. My eight month old son immensely enjoyed them, and I looked at the ingredients and was really surprised to find sugar listed second, right after the cultured milk. It is organic sugar yes, but still added sugar- and I'm bummed as this was not something that I wanted to introduce to his diet yet. My fault that I was swayed by advertising, and didn't read the back."
1,"I actually eat these myself due to a very, very restrictive diet. They are very tasty, and I really like this brand over Gerber's."
1,"I have 2 boys, 5 and 8 and they love Happy Melts! They have been on a kick with Banana Mango but love all the flavors. My 5 year old was asked to bring the snack to school last week and we brought these to share. All 13 of the kids in the class loved them and asked for seconds. My 8 year old is an extremely picky eater and he loves these as well.<br />  My favorite thing about them is that they contain probiotics (helps maintain a healthy balance of good bacteria in the intestines and boost your immune system) and prebiotics (which keeps the good bacteria healthy). I have checked other brands and Happy Melts is the only product to have both of these. I also love that it comes in BPA packaging and does not contain anything artificial. I wish I could give this product 10 stars!!!"
1,"These are so much better than Gerber...all organic, real fruit inside and much less sugar!  I bought them for my 2 year old but my 7 and 5 year olds like them just as much!  I pack them for their snacks at school!  I give my 2 year old the bag when we're in the car or at the store.<br />Great too for a little one under one because they disolve easily in the mouth.<br />If my kids ask for dessert after a meal, I often reach for these so we get the best of both worlds- they taste like candy for the kids but they are filled with healthy fruit and nothing bad for you!"
1,"I wouldn't suggest feeding your little one a million of these a day, as they are high in sugar, but they sure are delicious!  He loves them (and so do I)!  They melt almost immediately, so they are a great first finger food."
1,"I would definitely recommend these. They taste a lot better than Gerber yogurt melts, and they are better for you. Even my husband likes them and will snack on them, which is saying something because usually anytime I have him taste our daughter's snacks, he makes a horrible face and asks how in the world she can eat it. Not the case with these. And my daughter (now 17 months) likes them, too!"
1,"I've been feeding these to my 10 month old as ""dessert"" for the past month or so, and he loves them.  I like them too, and have been known to pop one in my mouth when I'm putting them on his tray.  We were out the other day, and our local grocery store doesn't carry happy bellies, so I picked up a bag of Gerber melts.  How different could they really be?  As it turns out, very.  Baby ate the Gerber ones okay...but I tried one and almost spit it out.  It tasted like cardboard. These ones actually taste like strawberry yogurt.  You can't go wrong!"
1,"My daughter loves these yogurt melts.  Banana and Mango are two of her favorite flavors.  The melts themselves are a smaller size than the Gerber melts, which is nice for younger babies.  I was always breaking the Gerber melts into 3 or 4 pieces, which got a little messy.  I don't have to do that with these melts.  These are tasty AND organic.  We've had a lot of success with all of the Happy Baby products we've tried.  Highly recommend."
1,My daughter has loved these since she started with finger foods at about 8.5 months. They are great for 'on the go' and keep her occupied (as well as a nourished snack!). She is breastfed but had yogurt already so I knew she didn't have a milk allergy. Less sugar then Gerber!
1,My son started eating these at 12 months. He's now 18 months and still loves them!! They're healthy and I feel good about giving them to him. I would say this is his favorite snack - always cheers him up!
1,Shared this flavor with my moms group kiddos and they were a big hit. I have put in a request that our local Publix start to carry this flavor because they don't carry it and no one had seen it yet.
1,"These are the first finger snacks I gave my 8-month old, whom was already on solids at 5 months though. I found them originally at my local Target. He absolutely loves them.  They melt in your mouth.  I've had nieces and nephews that love to snack on these too whenever they come to our house.  They range from 3 to 8 years old.  I like how it's just organic yogurt, and how they're perfect for little fingers.  I only wished that they'd sell these in a variety pack for all the flavors.  The banana mango is my son's favorite."
1,"Our toddler LOVES his HappyMelts!<br /><br />These little yogurt bites are healthy, yummy, and organic. Perfectly sized for toddlers who are learning to become independent eaters. The Happy brand has less sugar and none of the harmful artificial colors/flavors that other brands contain. I feel good offering these to my toddler, and he always finishes his pile.<br /><br />All flavors are hits in our home."
1,"My 10 month old baby loves these. She can pick them up and eat them. I tasted one myself and they dissolve in your mouth and they are not too sweet, just enough sweetness. I love that they are organic and don't have anything artificial."
1,"We used to get the gerber ones, but for almost the same price these are a bit smaller for him to handle and he seems to like them much better."
1,My 11 month old loves these melts - she's been eating them since she was about 7 months old.  The only problem - not really a problem just an observation - is that once her fingers get wet the melts tend to stick to them and she has some difficulty getting them from her fingers to her mouth - she generally ends up with several stuck to her head and behind her ears (not unlike the rest of her food I suppose).  She also likes the berry flavors - I think they're pretty tasty too but all the other adults who've taste-tested found them foul.  Oh well.
1,"Would you believe that my daughter doesn't like yogurt?! Odd b/c I thought every child loved yogurt... these are the answer for my yogurt-avoiding-14-month-old! She thinks these are candy and pops them in her mouth one after the other. I have to admit that sometimes I enjoy a few myself! Price is good at a couple of bucks per bag. I mix these with her cheerios and it makes a delicious snack. I too tried the Gerber brand b/c they were on sale at our local supermarket but they were not such a hit. Strange b/c to me, they taste about the same... go figure!"
1,We have always bought the Gerber Yogurt Melts and my kids were not too much into them. A friend gave me a bag of the Happy Baby Banana Mango yogurt melts.... WOW! The kids (2&4) ate the whole bag- they practically fought over the bag. I thought they had so much more flavor than the Gerber brand. Very happy with the Happy Baby products. Looking forward to trying the other flavors too!
1,The Banana Mango flavor is not our daughters favorite so will not order again but I love the melts in general and we all enjoy them so rec. to any baby/toddler.  Great alternative to the other popular sugary brand.
1,My toddler son loves these melts. They are a great way to get your child extra calcium if they aren't fond of drinking milk. They are a wonderful on the go snack for the times when feeding your child real yogurt is just way too messy.
1,"These are such a  wonderful alternative to the non-organic, sugar filled ones you find in your basic stores.  The melts are very tasty (I have tried them) but are not all the same size so for new solid food eaters you may need to watch which sizes they are given.  Have not tried the other flavors yet but plan to get them.  Wish they would sell a varity pack instead of having to buy 8 of one flavor."
1,My baby loves these treats (as does the rest of the family).  The fact that they are organic and are sweetened with natural cane juice rather than added sugar like the name brand grocery store type makes them even better.  Even though you have to buy 8 at a time we just found someone to share the order with.<br />Have also tried the mixed berry flavor with equal favor.<br />Highly recommend!!
1,"Pro:<br />1.  Organic<br />2.  Price in the pack is cheaper than the health food stores<br />3.  Tasty<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.  Easy to eat too many, so need to watch the sugar level but good.<br />2.  Sizes are sometimes quite uneven, but not a big deal and pretty expected.<br />3.  Not a lot for the price, but this is the same buying elsewhere.<br /><br />Overall the cons aren't really cons, just wanted to make sure parents that haven't tried these were aware.  Buy these regularly, so not really negatives."
1,"I purchased this organic yogurt snack for my daughter.she said the snack melt in her mouth quickly ,the different flavor tastes different, she likes the mixed berry most.<br />The only concern is the sugar content is still a bit high ,so I try to limit the amount I give her when  on the go ,at the playground ,recommend other moms  to try."
1,"I am a first time mom, and our child had A LOT Of difficulties with solid foods and had an overactive gag reflex.  This food (and we do buy these in the set of 8)was and continues to be a lifesaver.  When nothing else would do, our baby LOVED these. I will say that they are on the expensive side compared to what you can get in the grocery stores and ""big-baby-chain"" stores.  We compared these to the GERBER yougurt melts and I believe there to be a noticible difference in quality/ taste, with these coming out on top. In the begining when she was just starting solids she would eat bunches of these on her own. They melt very quickly and for us, there was never a concern for choking (or puking with the overactive gag reflex).  Our baby is older now and can eat a lot more table foods, but we still mix these in with other puffs, cherrios, and small cereals for her to eat as a mix.<br /><br />I have purchased three orders of these from amazon (and enjoy amazon prime shipping)- so will likely purchase again, would recommend to a friend, and would buy (in smaller portions) as a gift for other moms to try out."
1,My son has been snacking on these since 9 months old and he absolutely loves them! I even think they are tasty. Would recommend them as a great starter food/snack.
1,"My daughter is 16months old, I bought it for her, she like it very much! But I don't wanna give her much one day and let her know to share with her parents and friends!"
1,These yogurt snacks are staple in my one-year old's diet. She eats them every day and for snacks out on the town. No complaints at all.
1,"i first gave these to my older daughter when she was a yr old, and started giving them to younger daughter around 8mos.  now they're 3 and 1, and they both love these yogurt melts.  but i only let them share half a bag as a special treat sometimes when we're out and about, else they'll each eat a whole bag!"
1,"I purchased this snack fo my baby, but after i tasted I thought it's good for all family members!!!  so yumm~~ first it is kinda crunch and melts right away inside of your mouth~~ .you can fully taste yogurt flavor!!<br />However, do not forget to seal it tight ! specially rainy day!!! it is very easy to get soggy!"
1,I got these as an easy on-the-go snack.  My toddler loves them and will eat them non-stop if I let him!  I even sneak a few of them myself as they are incredibly tasty.<br />They are a little too pricey for me to eat myself though.  Wish more baby yogurt products were as low in sugar as these!  My son refuses more than a bite or two of regular yogurt but loves these.  I don't think he has much of a sweet tooth and prefers the mild tart flavor of these.<br /><br />My ONLY complaint is the price.  SIGH
1,"My daughter loves these yogurt melts.  She's been eating them since she was nine months old and is now 18 months old and still enjoys them as a snack.  For me, the sugar content is still a bit high so I try to limit the amount I give her.  These are great, no mess snacks when on the go, at the playground or at the beach.  I have to put a small amount in a separate container in my diaper bag because my daughter recognizes the packaging and would really like to eat the whole bag."
1,"I was so glad to see the 8-pack and the great price for these baby treats.  Our baby loves them, but in stores, it is hard to pay the retail price for just one bag.  Now we have a pantry full and I don't feel so badly about using them up after getting such a great deal."
1,"I first tried these with my twins when they were starting on solid food.  I figured they liked yogurt, so they'd probably like these.  And they did, but only for the first couple of bags.  Fast forward a few months when they spotted an unopened bag and pointed... now they love them!  Afternoon snack often features ""yoga melts"" along with a happy dance."
1,"We have been buying these melts for about 7-8 months now for our daughter. They do tend to go fast, and since they are pricey we buy them sparingly and give them to her as a special treat. No funky ingredients in these that you cannot pronounce. I love how you know exactly what you are giving your child with these (and bonus, NO artificial colors/dyes!). I definitely recommend them as an addition to your diaper bag essentials. They keep my daughter busy when she is getting antsy while out running errands. Overall a great snack to have on hand for your little one(s)!"
1,"These are my 2-year-old son's favorite snacks of all time. Having tasted them myself, I can see why! I like to make a toddler ""trail mix"" with them, using pretzels, puffs, etc; but he typically picks the yogurt melts out of the mix, eats them, and then asks for more melts, ignoring the other stuff. It's nice to have a snack option that offers the nutrition of yogurt without having the mess of regular yogurt, or the need for refrigeration. We don't do a ton of dairy in our household, so I like that, in addition to being delicious, this snack is a good calcium source.<br /><br />These are nice for younger babies too because, as the name implies, they melt in the mouth. I know there are other companies out there that make yogurt snacks, but I like that these are 100% organic, preservative-free, and have pre- and probiotics. Highly recommend."
1,"I confess that I steal some melts off my daughter's tray while she is eating. I love these melts. My daughter is 11 months old and enjoys these for a little snack. They are made from real fruit, are gluten free and have pre and probiotics to help with digestion. Love it!"
1,"These are the first finger snacks I gave my 8-month old, whom was already on solids at 5 months though. I found them originally at my local Target. He absolutely loves them.  They melt in your mouth.  I've had nieces and nephews that love to snack on these too whenever they come to our house.  They range from 3 to 8 years old.  I like how it's just organic yogurt, and how they're perfect for little fingers.  I only wished that they'd sell these in a variety pack for all the flavors."
1,"These are good. I like that they are organic, and my 2 year old loves them. They do melt if dropped, so sometimes a pain to have to scrape off the floor, but they are nice to take on the go. Excellent flavor, not chalky tasting at all. I eat them myself!"
1,"My 14-month-old loves these yogurt snacks. I've been pleased with all of the Happy Baby line including cereal and puffs. Also, I just recently bought a few of the frozen items, which have gone over well. Delicious and healthy!"
1,"He doesn't like many dairy products, but these he loves.  And, they have no gelatin for the vegetarians out there.  They make his fingers sticky, but so do all the yogurt melts."
1,My son is obsessed with these melts.  He will literally drop whatever he's doing at any given time if I present these to him.  I tried them and I don't like them but every child I've met loves them.
1,"I would definitely recommend these. They taste a lot better than Gerber yogurt melts, and they are better for you. Even my husband likes them and will snack on them, which is saying something because usually anytime I have him taste our daughter's snacks, he makes a horrible face and asks how in the world she can eat it. Not the case with these. And my daughter (now 17 months) likes them, too!"
1,"Happy Baby products are the best!  The yogurt melts are not messy at all and it's great to give your toddler a snack that's organic and has real fruit inside!<br />Happy Baby's customer service is great- everytime I contact them with a question, they respond within a day with so much info!!"
1,"My 2 young toddlers loved the Gerber yogurt melts, but it was getting too expensive to buy so many packs every week. I ended up trying these Happymelts, and thank goodness my daughters liked these too.  Personally when I tried them, I preferred the Gerber better as these were a little chalky, but since these are organic and cheaper on Amazon, I went this route. Love that this is yogurt that doesn't make a mess, doesn't require refrigeration, and is easy to transport. The girls love this when we're out and needing a snack."
1,"If I let him, my kid would eat these all day long every day. I have a friend whose kid won't eat anything healthy, but he'll eat these. They're pricey, but way more portable than fresh yogurt and not full of a bunch of artificial stuff."
1,"They're a lot tinier than the Gerber ones, but they're also ""healthier"". My son loves both, and I'm happy I found them for a relatively good price (do subscribe and save if possible!)."
1,My baby eats these like they are going out of style. They are the perfect size for her to grasp with her fingers.  So nutritional too!
1,"My son loves these yogurt treats!  All the favors are delicious, so you can't go wrong.<br /><br />Great product!"
1,"I love these.  They are tastier than Gerber, but better for baby. My daughter eats a bag every four days, so we buy the six pack through subscribe and save.  She loves the strawberry flavor, and so do I.  I like to play ""Feed Momma"" because they are so good!"
1,"I first offered these to my little guy at about 6mos. He enjoyed them, but wasn't crazy for them.<br /><br />Off and on over the last seven months, he'd pull the bag from his snack shelf and ask for them. Sometimes a week or two would go by with no request. Other times he'd want to snack on them all day.<br /><br />I think they're tasty too.<br /><br />My little guy is a yogurt fan beyond this treat, but it's handy to have in your on-the-go stash."
1,"Our 9-month-old son loves these!  Quick, healthy, non-messy snack that can easily be tossed in the diaper bag for on-the-go snacking.  We'll definitely be trying more flavors!"
1,My 10 month old loves these!  They dissolve in her mouth and are helping her with her hand/mouth coordination.  I love that she's having a healthy snack and can eat them on her own without having to worry about her choking.  Highly recommended.
1,"My son loves these melts. They are easy to take with us, and great to mix with other treats to give as a healthy snack during the day. I secretly like them too :)"
1,"I really like these. They melt in your mouth like astronaut ice cream and bring back fond memories of my childhood. Plus they're all organic and the entire bag only has 120 calories so you don't have to feel too bad about eating them all. The strawberry is definitely the best flavor. I've had the other two and they're okay but I don't think they're worth the high price.<br />I know Gerber makes their own version of these that I have seen at Safeway for only $3 each but I think they aren't organic. The only reason I would buy the Gerber ones is that they have strawberry, wildberry and peach flavors instead of strawberry, wildberry, and some sort of banana mango flavor. I don't remember exactly what the yellow flavor is...only that I disliked it.<br />AMMENDMENT TO REVIEW: The Gerber version is nowhere near as tasty as these ones. They are larger and chalkier and taste more artificial. If you are going to buy them online anyway, go for the good stuff."
1,My son and I share these as an afternoon treat every day.  They're his absolute favorite (and mine too!)
1,"My 18-month-old can't get enough of these!  She has never liked yogurt, so this is a nice way for her to get some good organisms in her little body. I order them through the Amazon Subscription option, so shipping is always free, and they are less expensive (15% off, free S/H, plus the quantity discount of buying 6 at a time)."
1,"My daughter loves them!  The strawberry are way better than the other flavors, too."
1,"My daughter loves these yogurt melts.  They are so healthy and yet she thinks they are a dessert.  Gerber makes a similar product, which is just as good, except these are organic.  Love that I can find 8 packs of them on Amazon.  I have a hard time finding them in stores."
1,"We introduced this finger food to our little guy when he was eight months old. He could not get enough. Super easy for this kiddos to handle and the melts ""melt"" in their mouth so no worrying on the parents' part necessary! Easy to travel with the pouches also."
1,My 11 month old daughter really loves these.  They are easy for her to eat and they melt in the mouth faster than cereal.  This is a great finger food to start kids on because it melts so quickly and is easy for a baby to eat if they don't have a lot of teeth.
1,"I have 12 month olds and no time to write a great review, but they like all the flavors, the textures are great, and the pouches open easily. Great on the go snack. Wish they came in bigger servings."
1,"I just want to say that my daughter likes to eat very much ,I had to control her<br /><br />Sour and sweet,and organic."
1,"My daughter was 12 months old before we gave her any food out of a package, everything up until that point was home cooked vegetables, fruit and grains.  From what I can tell, these are a ""healthy"" snack that she really enjoys.  They do taste delicious and are easy to take on the go.  Right now they are very helpful because chewing is uncomfortable with all her new molars; these melt in her mouth and satisfy her.  We will definitely buy more of these!"
1,"I like these yogurt melts as a healthier alternative to those available in my grocery store, but I wish the sizes were a little more predictable. Some of the melts are tiny, while some are nearly an inch in diameter! I also agree with the reviewer who said they would like to see a variety pack instead of having to buy several packs of a single flavor."
0,"Let me start by saying my two little boys (1 and 2) like these, but I think it's because they don't know any better! These have a foul smell and taste. I don't know what is creating that odor and taste since these are not expired. I will not order these again. I don't know how some of the adult reviewers who are eating these can stand them. We buy happy baby greens puffs and love them. I have bought other happy baby items and thought they were great. These are a miss."
1,These are great and my baby loves them but I have to pick through the bag to give him right size.  Some are small and some just too big for my little guy.  I wish the company could come up with some kind of quality control.  The Gerber yogurt melts are very consistent but I prefer these because they have more vitamins than Gerber.
0,"We purchased this product and the ziplock seals did not function, so there was no way to reseal the package after opening.  We tried to contact every single email address on their website and nobody at that company thought it was important enough to respond.  There are lots of organic baby products out there, and we will purchase from other companies and hope others will do the same."
0,These should have an age limit. I do not think that breast fed babies under one should be allowed to eat these. Babies do not need probiotics at such a young age. My daughter ate about 5 of these and a couple of hours later projectile vomited all over the place! She does not spit up ever. I wished that I would have bought just one bag of these before I bought a whole lot of them!<br /><br />I think she will like them when she is a little older and used to eating other foods. She is mostly breast fed and eats some solids.
1,I love the chamomile tea. Its sweet and mild. Its excellent for a bed time tea.
1,I like to have some on my christmas tree for the grandkids and so on they love them if they can beat me to them!!!
0,"when i recieve this item, the jub was split down the middle and ketchup was all over inside the package it came it."
0,I specifically ordered the 114 oz. jug because I have a pump that fits it. Instead I received 3 44 oz. containers. These will be returned.
0,Oh my Gosh...How can anyone pay this astonishing price for the same container of Ketchup available from multiple local stores for less than $6?
1,"This is good oregano. It is just little to much - 3 bottles, I had to give one to my sister."
0,"I BOUGHT THESE FROM AMAZON PRIME FOR 10 ON OCT. 26.  NOW THEY ARE 26 PLUS 8 FOR 34 INC SHIPPING.  AMAZON PRIME NO LONGER CARRIES THEM OR OFFERS THEM ON BACKORDER, IF THEY WERE OUT OF STOCK.

1,"This a best product, we all love SHAN's Masala Mix(especially Biryani Mix). But here it looks so costly, we buy this for $0.99 each from local Indian Store...."
1,"This is the best tomato soup I have tasted, ever. It's sweet and tomato-y and very well seasoned. I always hated tomato soup growing up, since I was fed that popular brand with the red label. Then one day I tried this, and was blown away. Low in calories, too!"
1,"I have missed tomato soup since going gluten free.  While this is no way at all like the canned tomato soup I like, this soup is awesome.  The flavor is great and I use it to casseroles or just as a soup.  Give this a try."
1,"I am not reviewing this as a soup because I'm not a tomato soup person, but it does make a good enchilada sauce! I do not like buying prepared sauce, because they usually come in little cans that just don't have enough product, and they are often made with ingredients that I don't want. A food blogger shared a recipe for a ""two ingredient enchilada sauce"" (would love to give you the link here, but I'm not allowed!) that called for a box of roasted pepper and tomato soup, and a can of green chiles, mix them in a blender until smooth and done! The first time I made this soup-based enchilada sauce I didn't have any green chiles, so I added a tablespoon of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F0JL7S"">Bearitos Taco Seasoning, 1.4-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)</a> instead. That's how I make our enchilada sauces now and I will never go back to the canned stuff."
1,"This is my first experience with Dr. McDougall's Right Foods.  All I can say is , this one is my favorite.  There is a goodly amount of very creamy, full-flavored soup.  I use it for lunch or as a base to cook other things with. It is a vegan food. I recommend it highly."
0,"I love the McDougall food products, but this one didn't quite measure up. It has an aftertaste that I didn't enjoy. If you can find a single container to try first, I'd recommend doing that."
1,Exactly as described. It tasted great and was awesome getting so many of them. I felt like I was entering my own personal grocery story every time I opened my cupboards. :P
1,My dog is very picky. I tried these treats because he doesn't care for rawhide or 'chewy' types. These are baked and smell wonderful. Very crunchy and you can break them in two if you want. They come in a zip- lock bag to keep them fresh. They are a bit pricey (I wish they'd come in larger numbers) but well worth it for my dog.
0,"My dog loves the sweet potato chicken wraps which is why I was so disappointed when I read i tiny letters on the back ""made in China"". Although this company as not been recalled to the best of my knowledge I'm not willing to risk giving my dog any treat made in China."
1,OUR DOG LOVES THESE TREATS... SHE WILL DO ANYTHING TO GET THEM... HER TAIL GOES CRAZY KNOWING SHE'S GETTING A DUMBBELL
1,"Thanks a lot, Treat-Umms. Before we discovered your product, we used to sleep in, say, to 7:30 AM or so. Since we have been giving our 6 dogs (5 chihuahuas and a Japanese Chin) Chicken & Sweet Potato Wraps as a morning treat, they have trained us to get up at 5:30 every morning, or earlier, to get their little mouths wrapped around one of these wraps. They are relentless. And of course, being fairly intelligent and trainable, we have complied with their wishes completely. (BTW, one of our chi's has a liver condition, and these treats agree with him just fine.) This product is highly recommended (unless, of course, you value your sleep).<br /><br />Signed, Sleepless in A-town"
0,"What more can I say? I usually buy this kind of treat at our local discount shopping center, but I realized those dumbells were made in China, and that made me nervous after all the quality control problems China has had with pet foods and treats. If I remember correctly, I think these are made in the US, so I felt better about giving these to my dog. Too bad she wouldn't eat them. Picky, picky!"
1,My poms love these! Hard to find in stores - glad to find them online for about the same price.
1,"My little 6 pound long haired chihuahua absolutely LOVES these treats!  She would eat five a day if she could, but I limit her to only one per day.  She gets very insistent on having one, so I usually break them in half and give her one half now and the other half later.  If you don't give her one on demand, she barks and then barks again and then barks again - a single bark each time - as she sits in the kitchen patiently waiting for her dumbbell - and won't accept any other kind of treat.  Her mind is fixated on these chicken dumbbells! When you do give it to her, she snatches it in her mouth and runs away like she has the King's ransom!"
1,received on time... items priced less than normal purchase place.  my doggie loves treat-umms.
1,Our Bichon loves these drumsticks.  They're natural and you can break them in two if you'd like.  These are his favorite treats!
1,Dukie loves the sweet potato chicken wraps!!!<br />Too bad it can't come to Hawaii directly!!<br /><br />You best friend will not be disappointed by this product!!!
1,"This product is made with excellent quality ingredients and packaging.  The vanilla that is added gave my biscotti, sweet rolls and cakes the best taste ever. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who bakes. It's delicious."
1,Nicely and conveniently packaged. If what your after is Italian grand mom style tarts and pies... there is no way you can make them without this yeast!
1,"This is very high quality cocoa powder, with high cocoa butter content.  It makes excellent hot chocolate, brownies, mochas, and frosting.<br /><br />It is not Dutch process, so it is suitable for most uses which do not explicitly call for Duch process cocoa.<br /><br />It ships in a durable and resealable plastic bag, and stays fresh and dry for months."
0,"Okay,<br /><br />I bought a case (4) Jars of this ""Kauffman Pennsylvania"" brand Pumpkin Butter.<br /><br />At first I thought I got a batch of rotten butter due to the 100 degree heat. Bitter Blan taste.<br /><br />Turns out that my 32 year daughter likes this product because It's low in Sugar compaired to the other brands.<br /><br />I find It very Bland, Almost like the canned Pumpkin that you buy to use to make Pumpkin Pies. I had to add Cinnimon to my Peanut Butter & Pumpkin Butter sandwich.<br /><br />No Cinnimon and clove flavor at all. (Bland) !!<br /><br />I myself love Trader Joe's brand. It Bursts in my mouth with Flavor !!<br /><br />I love Trader Joe's Pumpkin butter so much, I just bought a case of 24 Jars at $2.50 a jar. Normal price, Not Bulk price.<br /><br />I see others here on Amazon.com selling the Trader Joe's Pumpkin Butter for $14.50 a jar !!<br /><br />I'm no way affiliated with or nor am I an employee with Trader Joe's<br /><br />I just love Trader Joe's Pumpkin Butter, Love it !!"
1,"I've purchased this item at an apple orchard in upstate New York two years straight. It's very smooth and spreadable, with a nice, very lightly-spiced, sweet taste. I must say, I have tried other brands which were OVERWHELMINGLY autumn-""spicy""/nutmeg-y, which I didn't like as much as Kauffman's. It's so good, in fact, that I can't wait 'til the fall and need to order another jar. My family enjoys it too. Also, the company was very warmly responsive to inquiries by e-mail. Don't hesitate to try it for a nice alternative to jam!"
1,I've had five dogs in My life three of them growing up and My service dog Nina is most health dog. I've had and I feel it is because of the dog food I feed her. Which is Natures Logic dry dog food and canned dog food.
1,Ingredient list shows good quality. I purchased the venison because I was advised by a friend it was good for weight loss. I have one dog who has been on many different diets without any success at losing any weight. He's been fed this venison canned food for less than a month and I'm already seeing some weight loss. I think it's working.
1,"I tried this as a change of pace from my fave, Cafe Bustelo.  Couldn't believe it.  Much better quality.  I never have seen it in a store (Chicago).  Fresher beans.  Nice flavor.  Maybe a bit lighter."
1,"Like the previous reviewer, I tried this to see how it compared to my favorite, Cafe Bustelo.  Not only is it a bit cheaper, but it tastes great!  It takes just as good when brewed in a drip coffee maker as an espresso machine - though, I prefer the stronger taste of the espresso brew.  It's just as bold as Bustelo but a little smoother, and makes an excellent iced coffee in the summer.  As a tip, you can purchase all of the Bustelo brands from Javacabana.com for much cheaper than you can find anywhere else."
1,Really enjoyed orange slices in the past.  Have not had in a long time and this purchase did not disappoint.  Fantastic price of $7.57 w/free shipping. Slices very fresh..  Simply stated - extremely pleased.
1,"I have loved Orange Slices since I was a child, but they are so hard to find now.  I Googled this great treat, found them and ordered.  I've had to hide some of the orange slices' packets, because I will indulge myself and eat too many, which isn't a bad thing."
1,"This syrup has just the right flavor, it's the perfect blend of toffee and nut. Just a dab added to a cup of coffee after dinner makes a perfect desert coffee for just about anyone who drinks coffee! Highly recommended."
1,"This syrup is quite delicious with the combined toffee and nut flavors. The flavor does remind me a bit of popcorn though for some reason. If you are looking for a syrup to make the Starbucks Salted Caramel Mocha then this toffee nut is not the same as the one Starbucks uses, it has a distinctly different flavor. It is very good but not quite what I was looking for (hence the 4 stars).<br /><br />My product came in a glass bottle with a metal screw-on lid, but shipped surprisingly well in the mail.<br /><br />Serving size: 1 oz. Calories 80; Sugar 21; Carbohydrate 21."
0,"My kids love this cereal, but I won't be buying it again. Or any other Kashi product.<br />Why? Kashi led us to believe that their ingredients were healthy. Then it was found out they were using GMO's. This was the exact thing that I thought I was avoiding by buying Kashi."
1,This is my favorite cereal.  I love cinnamon and this cereal has it in abundance.  It tastes very much like cinnamon toast crunch cereal with less sugar.
1,"I'm sharing my ultimate chicken recipe secret here...Preheat oven, 350. Crush Kashi Warm Cinnamon Oat Cereal between two sheets of wax paper. Then, after dipping skinless, boneless, chicken breasts in Almond Milk, I roll each chicken piece in the Kashi crumbs, then dust pieces with paprika (or cayenne if you like the heat) and garlic powder. (I do this in two steps because I omit paprika and garlic powder on a couple of pieces for my Grandson) The combination is to die for. Spritz with EVOO, oven bake as you usually do for oven fried chicken. While the chicken bakes, put 4 T. coconut oil on a cookie sheet and place on empty, lower rack in oven. Slice 5 washed yams in 1/4 inch diagonal slices. Remove the warm cookie sheet and toss yams in melted coconut oil. Return yams to oven. Yams will be done about the same time as chicken...but check so they don't become mushy. You will love this chicken, if you love cinnamon, and the yams are better than candy. Hope it makes your day."
1,I like the product because it has one of the lowest grams of sugar compared to all others. And it is healthy.
1,"For me the perfect cereal. It's flavor full with cinammon, healthy, very crunchy and only slightly sweetened.  Already buying in boxes of 4!"
1,I recently bought this cereal and it tastes great. The cinammon flavor the cereal gives is satisfying and when you're all done eating the cereal itself you're left with cinammon milk.
1,Nice to have these cinnamon oat cereal.  My kids love them and they are a healthy breakfast.  I give them at their lunch for an extra  treat.  Love the taste.
0,"I really like Kashi products, but the cinnamon taste of this is overwhelming, unlike the subtle enhancement that Cinnamon Harvest was to Autumn Wheat.  I regret buying this because it is way too strong, even for this person who really likes cinnamon."
1,"This cereal is very expensive, but I love it. Buying this way is much cheaper than I can get anywhere else."
1,"There is a whole lot of cinnamon in this cereal (i.e. a lot of cinnamon left in the milk dregs), and I love it! I think it tastes like gingerbread, but I could be wrong. There is no ginger, but it reminds me of some kind of Christmas cookie in America. I have not purchased this cereal from Amazon so I can't talk about Amazon's quality or packaging/shipping, but the cereal itself is very good. It's the regular Heart-to-Heart cereal, but with an upgrade of sorts."
1,I have been eating this cereal mixed with cherrios for the past year and have found it very<br />satisfying. I would reccommend this cereal to everyone.
1,"This is by far the most delicious cereal I've ever eaten. I eat this for a snack, too. If given the choice between potato chips and this cereal, I would choose this cereal, and that says a lot. I think I literally ate an entire box of it in two days, it's just that good."
1,"My wife and I both have this cereal almost every morning, and we've been doing so for a while. The flavor isn't overwhelmingly sweet or cinnamon-y, making it a lasting staple in our kitchen for an easy breakfast; what's more, it doesn't get old. The four pack lasts us about a month, maybe  a little less. We'd recommend trying it out and then if you like it, subscribe and save. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007A43NMG"">Kashi Heart To Heart Honey Toasted Oat Cereal, 12.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a> Isn't bad either, if you want to give it a try."
1,These are great for a quick & filling breakfast. The cinnamon flavor adds a nice twist to the original. The cereal pieces are more on the crunchy and thick side in terms of texture. The little heart shaped pieces are a nice touch.
1,"My husband is a type 1 diabetic, and this is a breakfast cereal he can eat without blood sugar issues and enjoy the taste of. Cinnamon gives it a great flavor without needing a lot of sugar. Yummy!"
1,"A Healthy way to start your day & the High Fiber, cinnamon, low sodium and antioxidants are great for your Heart, Blood pressure, Cholesterol, Arteries & Blood Sugar Control.<br />I look forward to the great taste of warm cinnamon for breakfast every day."
1,"Healthy,excellant taste. I'm sure kids would love it also;my 9 year old grandson does. So much better for you than other cereals;more protein and fiber. Great deal next to the grocery store."
1,We buy this cereal with the 'subscribe and save' method since it is the only cereal my husband will eat.  And he eats a big bowl every morning!
1,Tastes just like regular heart to heart but with cinnamon added. I do not smell nor taste air freshener. Maybe they didn't purchase from amazon directly.
1,"This is my favorite cereal ever and was disappointed when my local grocery quit selling it.  I have tried multiple healthy cereals since to try and replace it but keep coming back to this. Glad to find it reasonably priced here. Lots of cinnamon taste but not overly sweet, my teenage son fights me for the open box."
0,"YIKES!!!!!!!!! What a hound dog!!!! This tastes like a cinnamon candle or holiday air freshner. I LOVE the original but this one is a dud!!!<br /> Sorry, Kashi, I love everything else I have tried!"
1,"This is my favorite tea. Very strong Bergamot aroma, and the tea is very fresh (I just drank a cup this morning from a bag I bought in January and it's not stale yet!). The silk bags allow really fast and thorough steeping. Shipping was super quick, and I love that the sachets are all in a single, resealable bag, rather than individually packaged. Less packaging=less to throw away. These are 2-cup sachets, but I use them in regular mugs, just being sure to only steep it for a few minutes. Sometimes I get a second cup out of a sachet if I save it (I'm not a purist, I just like tea!), but if you have a 2-cup teapot these are perfect for that, too.<br /><br />I bought the 50-pack in January and I need to buy another one real soon.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just bought another pack, plus one of the Chocolate Mint, and it's just as high quality as the last. Definitely recommend this tea and seller."
1,This is hypnotic Earl Grey.  I get visitors to my office to smell the bag!  Quite possibly the best tea I've ever had.
1,My sister in law introduced my to the Harney & Sons Teas and I have to say they are so worth the money!!
1,"Great flavor, strong aroma (I get coworkers wandering by trying to score some free tea whenever I make this tea), the bags are sturdy, and the flavor doesn't get bitter if you overbrew it like I do.  Couldn't be happier with this stuff."
1,"A few years ago, I stumbled upon FiberOne products and simply spent all my free time annoying my friends and co-workers by talking non-stop about it. My friends joked that I should be the spokesperson. Well, fast forward a few years, and amazingly I've found a product that supplants FiberOne in my heart. FiberPlus has antioxidants that FiberOne doesn't have, but that's not why I like it better. I like it better because it generally just tastes better. FiberOne tastes fine (especially the raisin bran), but I still feel I am eating a ""health cereal."" This FiberPlus cereal tastes straight up delicious, regardless of its health benefits. I would be tempted to eat it even if it had the nutritional profile of Count Chocula. But of course, it's just as healthy as FiberOne.<br /><br />Keep in mind, these are just my tastes. The yogurt balls that are included in this cereal are things I really enjoy, but others may not. But in general, the total taste is superior."
1,"This stuff I found at my sister's place. I tried it and loved it. It made me think of raisin branne [sic] with yogurt. Why don't those guys make that? Or berry bran? Or banana bran? Diversify Brainiacs!<br /><br />Be very very careful. Don't ignore the verbiage on the front that says it has lots of fiber. I am a dude. I don't know or care what the hell that gibberish is supposed to mean.<br /><br />But I learned if you do 2-3 bowls of this awesome tasting stuff, it better be your day off of work. Or else you WILL be racing home from work for the duration of the whole day.<br /><br />It shoots the plumbing with a quickness. Recall or google Pope of Greenwich Village. When Paulie slips the cop a Mickie.<br /><br />I love the flavor and the healthy parts, but I only do 1, that is ONE bowl each day or couple days MAX.<br /><br />Be Smart."
1,"Got this on sale at my local grocery store to try it out. Wow! Love this cereal. Perfect amount of crunchiness, sweetness, and fiberness. I really like the flavor and sweetness of the yogurt pieces. Aside from the possibility of extra gas, this is an incredible cereal."
1,I would have given this 5 stars but because of my daughter's red dye allergy she could't enjoy this as well.  All the flavors were wonderful.  It tastes great.  I just wish that they would have used natural dyes to dye the berries red.  There are so many healthier options to chemical dyes.
1,"One of the best cereals I've ever tasted. I'm not a big cereal eater, but I can have 2 bowls of this in one sitting. Personally, I can't eat the same flavor over and over again, so that's why most cereals are a no-go for me. But in FiberPlus Berry Yogurt Crunch, that's not the case. The granola clusters and yogurt balls make it interesting.<br /><br />Buying the 3-pack of this cereal comes in really handy, as my husband and I both eat a lot of it, and we save a lot of money by doing it this way."
1,"I really like this cereal.  The high fiber keeps me full and regular.  The taste is really really good.  Does not taste boring like most healthy cereals.  The calories are a little high, but from good nutritious sources.  The price here on Amazon is unbeatable as these are usually $4 or $5 a box in the store."
1,"the cereal taste good and comes with the dry fruit that taste good too, makes me fool good having a bowl after work, it definitely satisfies, i have my bowl and take a nap, it feels good knowing its good for you, with fiber that cleans your digestive system and helps with cholesterol. and its a great price. I LOVE IT!"
1,I was a bit hesitant about Fiber cereals before I tried this out.  I had previously tried Fiber One and Kashi cereals and did not enjoy them.  This is healthy for you (granted it does have a decent amount of sugar in it) and tasty.  The little clusters are such nice surprises.  I eat this about 3 times a week and have not gotten sick of it yet.  Amazon's price is a great deal...cheaper than the stores.  And the stores hardly ever have them on sale.
1,This is a great cereal. It was fresh and crunchy. Just like what you get in the store and a good price as well. No complaints at all.
0,"I am always looking for new cereal products.  I usually stay away from Kelloggs as my first thought of their products is sugary cereals that mess up glucose levels.  I am very disappointed Kellogg's FiberPlus® Berry Yogurt Crunch cereal.  First it tastes similar to Sugar Frosted Flakes....way too sweet. Second, I eat a lot of 'rival' high fiber cereals and they do what they are supposed to do. Not this one.  And the product labelling is do I dare say a lie.  Misleading the public. 10g of fiber is 40% of 25.  10g of Fiber is not 40% of 28 or 35.  USDA recommends 28g per day.  Kelloggs has decided to change how many calories are recommended each day for an adult.  They changed it from 2500 to 2000.  Why. What do you think. I can think of at least three reasons.  I do not purchase Kellogg cereal and after this, never will again."
1,"This is a good, healthy alternative to the regular sugar laced cereals.  Sure it has sugar as well, but the health benefits more than make up for it.  I would definitely buy it again!!"
1,"A flavorful, low-acid coffee, our standard brew.  Consistently gets high marks from dinner guests, a good endorsement in a coffee town like Seattle.  Amazon price is consistently lower than local supermarkets."
1,"This coffee surpassed my expectations. Making it in a French press, it brewed up to a rich, smooth drink. One of the best coffees I've tasted."
0,"Coffee did not smell fresh like coffee upon opening package.  Also everyone at home and the office that drank it had to make a few trips to the bathroom (#2), it seriously upset my stomach.  Did the beans get picked to early?  Tried ordering again with the same issues."
1,"This was an awesome gift for my mom.  She can't cook and once a month I send her some sort of food basket.  This one, for the price, was by far the best one I have sent her in a year.  She raved about how good it was and ALL the items it came with not to mention\forget the basket!!!!  I will be looking here again for another one this month.<br /><br />Thank you!!!!!<br /><br />David Smith"
1,"I sent this gift basket to my father in law in Hawaii. It was delivered pretty fast and he loved it. I didn't see it in person but my mother in law explained it all. She said it's well packed and the chest is just adorable. The products in the chest are good too. Obviously, I made their day.I was glad to find this item right before I was about to purchase something else."
0,"UPDATE: After receiving order . . .<br /><br />My first review was a shimmering adoration of Argo tea, and this tea in particular. Now that my order has arrived and I'm drinking a cup, I have to ask: what happened? I used to be addicted to this stuff when I lived in Chicago and could go into an Argo store and buy it off the shelf. I remember it . . . differently.<br /><br />So--either I have changed, which is possible, or the other reviewer is right. (And my apologies for assuming he or she was misjudging.) There is something off about this tea, and I don't know what. But it does taste artificial and out of balance. Maybe it needs Chicago Municipal water to make the right chemical combination essential for the flavor I miss. But wow; what a disappointment. Proves the adage, ""you can never go back."""
0,"Nasty, chemical aftertaste.  Smells artificial.  I'm disappointed I wasted my money and will not be ordering from this company again."
1,"These tomatoes were packaged well and sent quicker than usual.  According to the people eating them, they were solid and juicy and full of flavor.  I will continue to order these as long as they are available for the season."
1,"My cat is an old fart at 16 years old so she doesn't get excited quite as often over things as she used to.  She always enjoys regular treats but for Christmas I wanted to get her a variety of different more natural treats and these were one of them.  She went off her rocker before I even had a chance to open them; she was licking around the seal of the closed plastic container!  Watching her eat them is half the fun - I'll put some flakes on the floor and she acts like a vacuum cleaner, frantically pushing them around to try to inhale them but sometimes they get stuck to her chin or whiskers and she can't figure out what's going on.  It's been a long time since I've seen her this animated over treats, and I never would have guessed it would have happened over fish flakes [they remind me of pieces of onion skin], so I'd say these are a winner in our house now!"
1,"My kitty went nuts when i first opened these. She kept running around my legs looking for the source. she can't have enough of em! Thankfully they're organic so she could have as much as she wants, and i don't have to worry about diabetes or diarrhea."
1,"My kittens go nuts for these, they absolutely love them.  The quantity is great for the price and its nice to find Bonito that are Amazon Prime eligible.  My kittens love other treats mostly greenie treats but these make them loose it completely.  The quantity should last me a year of regular use no problem!"
1,"Fish flakes are my kitty, Whiskers, absolute favorite treat of all times.  When we are out for any time at all she looks at me as if I have just absolutely broken her heart when I put another treat down in it's place.  This is not a look I like to get from her, trust me!.  Anyway, she is also quite particular about her fish flakes.  She has completly snubbed many a container, considering it unacceptable for consumption. This would be from a brand that we had bought before, so it's not like it was something new I was trying to pawn off on her.<br />These are a large container at a good price.  Plus, the flakes are nice and large, not all broken up into dust.  Which is absolutely unacceptable to her.  Also, our local pet store just stopped selling any flakes, so these are great.  Plus they are a better product at a better buy.  Whiskers and I highly recommend them."
1,"My crew loves tuna flakes, with 5 they go fast . When they know they are in the house they stay by my side thinking they will get a treat.<br />If you want to treat you kitty please try them, warning they will go fast !  At least with Belly rubs I know I will have more for my money ."
1,"I'm rating this 5 stars even though I haven't tried this specific product yet. Two out of my 3 kitties go nuts for tuna flakes! This was an ""emergency"" purchase as I ran out of what I usually buy, which is from Asian Food Grocer dot com, sold as people food, 3.5 oz. for under $6."
1,2 of my cats LOVE These treats. I thought the treats were crunchy.. they aren't. they're like shaved fish paper. They Smell TERRIBLE. To a human.. LOL.. the Cats LOVE the fishy smell though. The other two cats don't like soft treats.. only Crunchy ones.. So i have to hunt for another natural treat that's crunchy for them. The amount of treats in this bag was smaller than i thought; but that's fine.. i don't need to give a whole bunch since they are like shaved fish paper slivers.
1,"Soph loves Bellyrub...it's like kitty on crack. Cannot walk into the room without her running to the window perch and letting out the Siamese call for ""FISH FLAKES."" This is the best product for kitty treats. Two years ago she was diagnosed as anorexic; while recuperating (after being hospitalized and tube fed for several weeks), I researched feeding enhancements for cats, and fish flakes was highly recommended. I was dubious but decided to purchase one jar from local pet store. At first, I would sprinkle a little on top of her baby food treat and it worked. Now I buy in bulk and have to hide the container. She is happy and healthy and loves ""her fish flakes.""  Tried different brands, she likes them all. However, this brand/site is the LEAST EXPENSIVE. Sophya gives them Five-Stars."
1,"I prefer to eat alone as it is very important to me to savor each nuance with unobstructed emotions and not be tainted by someone else's opinion (besides the unruly one named ""Dog"" just horks stuff down.  I'm surprised he hasn't eaten the bowl by accident).  By dining on my own, I can laugh or to weep as the mood dictates, mindless of the sort of inhibitions companions might pose.<br />The first time I experienced Bellyrubs snacks, I tentatively licked up a flake and then another, and then another.  Each piece was a joy!  My shoulders relaxed.... my mind expanded.  For a moment nothing existed but me and the delicate tuna flakes.<br />Eating these treats do not disappoint, they are pure unadulterated, uncompromised joy.<br /><br />More please!<br />Steve-The-Cat<br />,,,^. .^,,,~"
1,"I gave it a 4 because my cat did not take to this at first.  I almost thought I had bought it for nothing.  Then I put it with her other treats and she started nibbling on it and now I gave her a handful this morning and she seemed to eat it all up. I think she will get used to it and like it better.  Comes in a paper package, though, not the container shown here."
1,"All 5 of my cats love this & eat it right up.  Very large container, so it lasts months when given a few flakes to each kitty."
0,"I guess my cat is not into fish but rather chicken and beef, when I opened the bag and put some on the floor, he just sniffed it and looked up at me as if to say ""what is this?"" and walked away no doubt disapointed, now I have no choice but to throw the whole bag away because he won't eat it, next time I'll just stick to Temptations treats, he loves those."
1,"We use these for training our kitty. Whether it's toilet training or trying to get him to ""speak,"" these work great.<br /><br />Only minor caveat is that they crumble easily, but I think it's just the nature of tuna flakes in general.<br /><br />1 box lasts a while and we feel better about treating him to something healthier than some of the other stuff out there!"
1,Cant get it out of the container fast enough! All 3 cats go crazy for this stuff & they never agree on anything! I'm ordering more!
0,"First off, I thought I was buying a container with a screw on lid,<br />such as the one in the photograph on this listing. What I received instead<br />was a blue mylar-fused zip-top bag. Those are harder to seal and keep fresh,<br />in my experience.<br /><br />Then the item itself. Sure, I read the reviews. At some point, food and treats are<br />food and treats, and you hope your cat will eat them. Well, count two cats here who<br />could not care less!  I shook some out on the floor. Both looked at me like I had<br />littered, and missed the trash can! There was cautious sniffing and walking away.<br />I ended up having to vacuum it up off the floor later.<br /><br />Now, I know it is a myth that cats adore fish. It's a cute story, and the fish bones<br />are just so darned cute when the graphic artists draw things about cats. The truth is that<br />most cats prefer some sort of poultry, and eat birds and mice - not fish. Few cats live<br />in the water, and even fewer own fishing rods! ;  )  They do not regularly attempt to eat<br />fish. (They do, however, love trying to catch the small ones in aquariums, just like they<br />would like to catch any moving object.)  My bad for not remembering that fish is at the bottom<br />of a cat's food choice list.<br /><br />What a waste this purchase was!<br />I can't recommend it at all. It was smelly, the cats ignored it,<br />and I definitely did not appreciate getting a different item than was pictured.<br />I wanted the one I thought I was buying based on the picture, not a substituted ziploc bag.<br />Seller should notify buyers of the difference and offer to cancel the order."
0,"The seller needs to update the picture. Product comes in a bag and NOT the screw-top container. Very misleading. Will not order again. The cats love bonita flakes, and trying to find a place for the bag that they can't get to will be a difficult thing. A hard container they can't chew on is what I thought I was getting. At minimum, the seller should be updating the description section to advise buyers."
0,"Quite disappointed in the product - not like other crostini crackers I have had in the past.  They were almost (not quite) burnt, but very close. I will not order this brand again. And now I am stuck with 11 packages.  Oh well another of life's lessons learned."
1,"I've tried at least a half dozen different types of these costini crackers, all bought through Amazon, and these were my favorite. Also got a graet price by sucribing for a once a month delivery.. They go great with wine."
1,"These almonds are very good with a slight zing of citrus lime in the favor.  I was surprised that the chili flavor to me was not as bold as I expected. Some of the Blue Diamond bold flavors like the Wasabi and Soy flavors are just, WOW, bold and overpowering.  This flavor while it was good it is milder and I didn't get a hint of a lot of chili until a minute or so after eating a few.  Even then it seems mild when compared to some of the other bold flavors.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 5% of your daily intake of sodium. The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them.  This is still a great flavor and I like them!"
1,"These almonds are very tasty and popular at my workplace. If you've had wasabi peas, you'll probably like these too. ""BOLD"" is a bit of an overstatement, as these almonds are not as intense as the peas with the nasal burn, but still do have a bit of kick. I wouldn't say the soy sauce flavor is that apparent, though, but I'm not counting that against the product.<br /><br />Most wasabi-flavored snacks really contain horseradish because it is a cheaper substitute. Wasabi is notoriously difficult to cultivate and the chemicals that give it its characteristic pungency are volatile.<br /><br />I like these a whole lot and routinely buy several cans of them from my drugstore whenever they are on sale. My mom's factory wo-workers like these too. However, I took this to a baseball game and it was almost universally hated. Go figure!"
1,"I love these Blue Diamond Almond snacks and I particularly like the bold flavors.  This flavor is very good and the smoky BBQ taste just sets off the flavor of the crunchy almond that it coats.  I like an evening snack while I read a book and these for me are just so much better than chips and other snack foods.  It gives you a chance to snack but still eat healthy.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat.  You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones.  I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor does have 7% of your daily intake of sodium and if you are on a salt restricted diet then make sure to watch your salt intake.  The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away.<br /><br />This is a very good product and I recommend it to you!"
1,"Rather than just eat chips for a snack I love the Blue Diamond Almond snacks.  This is one of my favorite flavors and the only problem is that they are hard to stop eating.  They have a nice rich smoky flavor and the jalapeno is just enough of a spicy kick to make these almonds taste better.<br /><br />The nice thing about this treat is that they have only 1 gram of sugar while giving you 6 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber.  They are a healthy snack and you get Vitamin E, magnesium and calcium in every serving.  This particular flavor does have 180 mg of Sodium (7% of a daily 2000 calories diet) per serving but they really taste good!  Just make sure that you only count our 28 almonds and eat one portion for 170 calories.  It is really hard to do and they taste so darn good!"
1,"I love Blue Diamond Almonds and this bold flavor gives you a spicy hot choice for a snack.  They are rich in vitamin E, magnesium and calcium while only being 170 calories for one serving.  They also add 3 grams of dietary fiber to your diet and 6 grams of protein while only adding 2 grams of sugar.<br /><br />They do contain 15 grams of fat but only 1 gram of saturated fat and 0 grams of trans fat. (Mostly they are the good stuff)  If you want a quick snack that is high in protein and low in sugar and sodium these are pretty good and spicy.<br /><br />While there are other flavors that I like more this one is still very good.  Just remember, they are addictive so you only get one serving!"
1,I love these.  I bring them to work for a between meal snack.  They are bold and really take the edge off my hunger.
1,"I'm a big fan of Blue Diamond brand Almonds. I really like the bold flavors, Habanero BBQ and Lime & Chili. I've never seen the Jalapeno Smokehouse flavor at the local grocery store so when I saw them on Amazon I decided to buy them.<br /><br />I'm pleased to say that I wasn't disappointed. This is right up there with my favorite flavors. It has just enough heat and jalapeno flavor with just a little bit of smoke. To me, these have almost as much heat as the Habanero flavor. Which isn't a bad thing. I like spicy.<br /><br />I would defiantly recommend these if you like the Bold line of Blue Diamond Almonds."
1,"The heat here is very very mild. I've had habanero sauces and chips that were so hot they made me cry for help. These are not like that. Only occasionally will you get a little kick. It's actually mostly tangy and tomato-y. The dusting of flavoring on the outside of the nuts will coat your fingers in an orange film.<br /><br />Satisfyingly crunchy and tangy, it's really hard to stop eating these. Even though the habanero kick isn't there as promised on the label, it's still really tasty. I highly recommend these. Sodium content is very low at 4% per serving. High in Vitamin E (35%) and magnesium (20%). This 1 pound bag (x3 bags) is a great deal compared to buying the 6 oz tins at the store, however, when my local Walgreens has buy 1 get 1, the price drops to about $0.35/oz.<br /><br />Blue Diamond makes about 8 other flavors that I know of. My favorites are the Soy Wasabi, Honey Roasted, Smokehouse, Dijon Mustard."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Blue Diamond brand almonds and I especially like the ""bold"" flavors.<br /><br />The Lime n Chili flavor is my favorite with the Habanero BBQ being a close second.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer that says the tartness of the lime flavor is just enough to bring out the chili flavor. Its a nice balance.<br /><br />I would say my only complaint is towards the end of the bag the flavor can get a little overwhelming because of all the extra spices that accumulate towards the bottom."
1,these taste amazing. might make the poops burn a little :o but they taste amazing. the salt and vinegar ones are the best and very addicting.
1,"When I first tried these tasty almonds, I was amazed at the great marriage of flavor. Has the kick of wasabi, and the sweet taste of roasted almonds. The first one is an eye opener each time even after you have had them many times. Bold and fun! If you like sushi, and you enjoy the taste of wasabi, these are for you."

1,"The flavor of these is just amazing. They are really addicting. They are slightly spicy, but they shouldn't be too spicy for anyone's palette. My 6 year old son really enjoys these, too. My suggestion is to open the 1 pound bag and pour a serving or two into separate containers for snacking. If you eat directly from the 1 pound bag, you are likely to eat the entire thing in one sitting because they are so addicting. I've also tried the Jalepeno Smokehouse and the Salt & Vinegar flavors from Blue Diamond. The Jalepeno Smokehouse are actually a little spicier than the Habanero BBQ if you're wondering. Compare the price per ounce on these and you will see they are the most affordable."
1,"I was concerned that these might be too hot, 'Habanero', but the heat is perfect as is the flavor... they are bold, if you like stuff plain--these are not for you... but if you like a robust flavor, a definite must!  Took some to the office and my office is all addicted by these now, you can't eat just one.  From a texture perspective, they are perfectly roasted - not chewy and not powdery, they are crisp.  I'm on a Paleolithic 'Paleo' diet and nuts like these are okay for me to eat - so they make a great treat.  I've gone through 7 bags in 3 months (sharing, of course)... I definitely recommend."
1,"This is the best product Blue Diamond sells, at least in my book. Spicy bbq flavor, like eating chips, but a much healthier alternative. You will not be sorry for buying these. I order these all the time, great deal on 3 pkg of 1 lb bags. YUM  PS:I am on atkins in the maintenance mode and miss chips, this is the replacement I was looking for: Far less carbs."
1,These are sooo great tasting and the individual  packaging is  great to get them handy around. Perfect buy to stock up as the individual packets are rare to find and there are many favors available however this one is my favorite.
1,Love these almonds!  Great flavor -- really hits the spot when those mid-afternoon hunger cravings set in! You won't be disappointed with this purchase!
1,"I used to buy the highly spiced and addictive Wasabi peas from an Asian grocery. They went great with beer. But the crunchiness of the dried peas got to me and my husband after a while, so we stopped getting them. When I run across Blue Diamond Bold Wasabi & Soy Sauce Almonds, I was ecstatic. Now I could once again enjoy the taste of Wasabi as well as enjoy the health benefits of almonds at the same time.<br /><br />You can tell that these almonds are flavored as they have a powdery coating. I was a little bit worried as I remembered that some of the wasabi peas were very hot. In case you're not familiar with wasabi, it is the green paste that is typically served with sushi and diluted down with soy sauce. It is also known as Japanese horseradish, and is quite hot. Fortunately, Blue Diamond has tempered the wasabi with  the savory taste of  soy sauce and it's not as hot as it is in Japanese snack food. But make no mistake, it still has a nice kick, but it doesn't have a long lasting effect. The initial punch of heat fades out quickly to make way for the salty, slightly smoky flavor of soy sauce, making it a very enjoyable snack.<br /><br />5 star snack!"
1,The taste is perfect. Smoky with just enough heat to let you know it is there. These don't have 5 alarm heat if that's what you are looking for. These almonds are perfectly seasoned and very addicting. Great if you are on a ketogenic or low carb diet.
1,"Hello everyone, I just had to write a review for these Wasabi and Soy Sauce flavored Blue Diamond Almonds, because I enjoy them sooooooo much! I am a bit of a wasabi junkie as I love sushi with plenty of soy sauce & wasabi, wasabi flavored shrimp chips, and tuna sandwiches made with wasabi mayonnaise, but my new wasabi flavored favorite are these Wasabi and Soy Sauce Almonds from Blue Diamond. The flavor is fantastic, as it is spicy but not so much to bring tears to your eyes. Also, the price of this product is great as well. Sometimes when my money is tight, and sushi is a little too pricey, I like to buy these almonds as an cheaper alternative, to satisfy my wasabi craving. Treat yourself to these awesome almonds today!"
1,"The Jalapeno Smokehouse almonds taste great and are a nice healthy option for a snack. The flavor is bold, but not overpowering or ""hot."" I also think they would be excellent chopped up and added to a salad."
1,"If you love almonds - especially Blue Diamond Almonds, these are great!  It is like Blue Diamond Almonds on steroids.  They are not incredibly spicy, but they have a little zip and a good amount of flavor.  A better buy than the Habanero BBQ ones for sure.  I would buy them again and they are great with a cold beer."
1,"These are excellent. The flavor is strong and pleasant. I think the package size is perfect for snacking.<br /><br />Besides general use, I recommend these if you go to a desert; these make you want to drink more, which is important as it is easy to get dehydrated and not notice it in desert environment."
1,"I am addicted to sushi, which is an expensive addiction.  I always keep a tin of these at work and at home to satisfy the craving.  My boyfriend, who doesn't like sushi, really enjoys these too, so they aren't just for sushi lovers.  I believe they are roasted, so they are not as healthy as raw almonds, but they still make a great afternoon snack."
1,These things are great. Perfect size bag for an afternoon snack. If you like salt and vinegar flavor you will like these.
1,"The ""Jalapeno Smokehouse"" flavor is the best flavor in the Blue Diamond ""BOLD"" series, hands down. Unlike some of the other flavors, this one really tastes like what it's supposed to taste like -- that is to say, smoky jalapeno peppers. To my jaded taste buds, the pepper spice is fairly mild, but I imagine most people find it packs quite a kick. It's a good thing these huge, perfectly roasted nuts are great for you, because I eat them constantly. Hey, my HDL cholesterol (the ""good"" cholesterol) has actually risen as I've gotten older. I like to think it's partly because of these luscious babies. Dr Jeddy prescribes a handful every day!"
1,"I'm addicted to Blue Diamond almonds. I've tried all the flavors -- and this was the last one I tried. I love salt, I love vinegar, and I love salt-and-vinegar potato chips, so how could I lose with these?<br /><br />Well, I'm just not that into them. The flavor's great and the almonds are fresh, but somehow the texture just fails. The almonds just seem... soggy. They don't have that wonderful crunch that the other Blue Diamond flavors have. And that flattens out the whole experience of eating them. I've eaten about 10 bags so far, and they all have the same lackluster texture.<br /><br />Oh well. Guess even my ol' reliable Blue Diamond can't hit it out of the park every time."
1,"I don't know what they put in these things, but whatever it is it's addictive. The combination of soy sauce salty and wasabi spicy create the perfect storm of ""I'm going to eat this entire can RFN.""<br /><br />The cans are all perfectly sealed and the almonds are always fresh - what else can you ask for? The cost is also lower than in local stores, but you can buy the larger bags cheaper (per oz) from some Walmarts if you can find them.<br /><br />Almonds are supposed to be appetite suppressants, but for me it's usually because I ate an entire can of them and am not hungry any more."
1,"I gave half of the 6 pack to my friend visiting from Tokyo. We both love them. Although, it would be nice if they came in bigger cans."
1,"Before we switched to eating low carb, we used to LOVE a nice big bag of chips.  I was missing those zesty salty crunchy snacks, until we found these delicious almonds!  I have tried all of the flavors and love them all, but these are my current favorite.  I like the snack size packs as a reminder that I have had enough since I can never stop eating them (just like potato chips, no one can eat just one).  A whole package is only  8 grams of carbs (only 4 grams of net carbs if you are an Atkins dieter).  These almonds have a nice crisp texture (even better if you put them in the refrigerator for a bit) and the seasoning is evenly distributed.  Not to strong, but also not too weak that it gets lost on the almonds. A package of 12 only lasted about a week in our home, back to order more."
1,"These are better than chips -- you can't eat just one!  Seriously, great snack when you're on the run."
1,"If you love salt & vinegar chips like I do, these are for you.  Great salty snack, high in protein, pretty filling, and without the grease of potato chips. Definitely recommend!"
1,The product arrived on time and fresh and this was the only place that I have found this tasty snack.  I would buy them again.
1,"While trying to cut back on carbs, and add more protein to my diet, I discovered this wonderful tasty snack.  At 260 calories, even this 1.5 oz pack is too much for a snack, but I divide the packs in half again and have a healthy snack that helps satisfy my hunger in the late afternoon.  They're also good as a breakfast on the run. The wasabi adds a wonderful punch-love them!"
1,Too good to last. Next thing I know it's all gone.  Everyone in the family loved it. You can't go wrong with Blue Diamond.
1,"Not generally a big fan of wasabi or of almonds, but somehow find these particular wasabi and soy sauce almonds to be a healthy addiction. My doctor recommended almonds as an excellent low-carb, high protein, high fiber snack with heart healthy fat and this flavor is great to meet that suggestion while providing a nice savory and spicy snack with a little salty crunch.  A little bit spicy but not too much (I don't tolerate really spice foods well).  I tried the smokehouse flavor by the same brand and didn't like it, but I could live on these wasabi and soy sauce almonds. The soy sauce flavor is hardly noticeable but just nicely tones down the heat of the wasabi."
1,"I've been participating in Weight Watchers for the last couple months (doing well).  I like to have a healthy snack at work mid-afternoon so I bought a bag of these at the grocery store.  They are so good I can't stop at 23 (a serving size).  I am not going to buy these again until I'm at my goal because I can't stop eating them.  They are quite salty so if you are trying to control your sodium, beware.  They are not as ""hot"" as wasabi peas, a more gentle kick.  I highly recommend them. Very savory."
1,WOW.  so many salt and vinegar snacks disappoint... i've only ever been satisfied by herr's... everyone else seems to be pretty weak.<br /><br />in steps blue diamond almonds with their take on salt 'n vinegar... i just received my shipment and i can't leave these things alone!  i'm going to get another order later in the year & give them out as christmas presents =]
1,"These are the tastiest of all the Blue Diamond flavors out there, in my opinion!  Just the right combination of vinegar sourness and salty goodness.<br /><br />Plus they're a very healthy low-carb snack.  The tin is just the right size, and the lid keeps them fresh for a few weeks (not that they tend to last that long!)"
1,I absolutely love these nuts! I can't find them where I live so I will continue to order these from Amazon. They are well worth the price.
1,"Better tasting then just about any potato chip and tons healthier too, especially for low carb diets. These things are just amazing. The lime and chili flavors are equally bold and complement the flavor of the almond quite nicely. Highly recommended.  They have some other flavors that may be worth trying too."
1,"Eaten alone these flavored almonds are a bit overpowering (pretty tart, but I love 'em). However, if you put them in a large container with other flavored nuts, such as lime 'n chili, along with raw almonds, cashews, walnuts whatever, the spices are spread among all the other nuts. A great snack. It was also cheaper and easier to get them through Amazon than to run all over town trying to find a store that carries the flavors I want."

A great snack. It was also cheaper and easier to get them through Amazon than to run all over town trying to find a store that carries the flavors I want."
1,"I could live off of these things, they are soooo good!  I usually get mine at the supermarket, but this 6-pack deal is a great idea for addicts like myself.  I guess the wasabi flavor is a bit weak, but that's perfect for me because although I love the flavor of horseraddish, it destroys my sinuses! lol"
1,These have a great combination of salt and vinegar which makes neither aspect overwhelming. They are insanely addictive and they go well with dried fruits like raisins to give some contrast to the salt. They are also high in fiber which makes up for their fat content to some extent.
1,"I love these.  They have exactly the right amount of spice/flavoring (which is probably too much) and I used to buy the 1.5oz package daily with lunch, but buying them in bulk makes so much more sense.  Yum!  The empty cans are good for storing loose hardware and small things around the house."
1,"Found these by accident - they are so tasty. Very hard to find in local grocery stores, so I was happy to find them on Amazon.com.  Will probably be ordering more.<br /><br />4/2/11 - I have since bought 3 more cases. I took some to work and everyone wanted to know where I got them. They asked me to sell them some when I get another shipment."
1,"This particular flavor of Blue Diamond almonds generally doesn't show up in grocery stores in this size cans. The occasional quick shop/gas station may carry them in the small bags. I travel and I look every time. It may not be everybody's favorite, but I'm sure glad I can get them in bulk."
1,We love these packages -- perfect for backpacks or as a traveling snack.  We will purchase them again!
1,"I am so thrilled to find these on Amazon! I don't know why it didn't occur to me to look earlier. I love salt and vinegar potato chips and these definitely hit the same flavor spot. But it's a much healthier alternative. They are still high in fat, as all nuts are, so eating a whole can in one sitting is probably not the thing to do. But a handful in the afternoon really takes care of my salt craving, the bold vinegar flavor makes a little go a long way and I'm getting some good nutrients too. As others mentioned, of all the ""bold"" flavors, this seems to be the one that is hardest to find in stores. Thank you, Amazon!"
1,My husband absolutely loves these.  He's self-employed and spends alot of time on the road - takes apples and these nuts with him.  He's even given them away at the jobsites and the guys all love them.  Great product and the free shipping is a real plus!
1,"I recently discovered the Salt & Vinegar Almonds they are delicious. The individual size is perfect for when on the go. I also purchased the cans for at home. Almonds are a very heart healthy snack, just try to limit yourself to a few a day. For my taste I would like to have more vinegar flavor."
1,"I love salt and vinegar chips, but never feel full even if I eat a whole bag.  (and I will!!!)  I thought the idea of salt and vinegar almonds sounded gross, but was willing to give it a try.  And boy they are great!  They have about twice the vinegar punch of most chips, and are amazingly good, and the fat is the good kind, and you get plenty full on the almonds.  Mmmmmm.<br /><br />I was buying the tins (which are sometimes available at the grocery store), but then realized I couldn't stop once I opened a tin and was eating something like 1,200 calories in a single day just on almonds.  So these packs are perfect - there are enough almonds to really satisfy a hungry stomach, but not so much to blow your diet.  And they're great to stash when you know that you won't be able to grab a real meal, but don't want to find yourself at a vending machine or 7Eleven buying crap b/c you're so hungry.  Even my (naturally thin) hubby loves them.  Perfect!"
1,I discovered that this particular flavor wakes me right up for the long drive home after dark.
1,I ordered some of these and literally ate them each day through all 24 packs.  They are addicting and delicious.
1,"These almonds are the most wonderfully satisfying snack ever. If you like salt and vinegar chips and you like almonds then you will absolutely love these nuts. I have had trouble finding them locally, so when I find them, I stock up. These 1.5 ounce bags are a perfect size to include in my husbands lunch."
1,"I love these nuts and it seems that most stores carry all flavors but the Jalapeno, I won't hesitate to order these again if I cannot find them next time, gotta have 'em!!!"
1,"These are great! As a lover of all chips I'm so happy to find a healthy alternative.<br />It's a great, flavorful snack."
1,"Almonds are one of the most healthy, satisfying foods you can find.  These are nice and spicy with the right snack size.  I debated getting these or the big tins, but the small bags helps me control the overeating and mindless snack munching."
1,Enjoyable all times of the day. Just the right amount of salt and flavor. This is becoming a favorite in my house. I also take it to work to satisfy that afternoon craving.
1,These are not easy to find in stores...and one must be diligent to keep them on hand! They do not create sores from acidity...they are better than any salt and vinegar chip I ever tasted. Highly recommend. Even better...new individual packets you can throw in your purse have been seen!
1,"This flavor is the best of the bunch by far.  I am reluctantly on a diet that allows for a few almonds as a snack.  I tried these and I was hooked.  Unfortunately, most stores do not carry this flavor.  My first case went very quickly, as every co-worker who tried them wanted a can of their own.  I recommend them to anyone, not only those of us trying to stick to a diet that deprives us of less healthy snacks."
1,Our order arrived yesterday and this morning we placed an order for more - the taste is addictive!!  Just enough punch and spice.
1,"I've tried smokehouse, jalapeno smokehouse, honey roast, lime and chili, and natural. But these are really the best of the lot I've tried. They have the nice fresh-tasting almonds you expect from Blue Diamond, and you can actually taste the wasabi (unlike the jalapeno smokehouse, where the jalapeno part is really elusive).<br /><br />I was reluctant at first to try this. Didn't think I'd like it. I was wrong. Terrific snack almonds (if you don't mind saltiness). Love em.<br /><br />Mir"
1,"Even though I (thought) I hated them for 25 years, I am a recent convert to the great taste and nutritional value of almonds. It is hard to find a quality almond. Some are too hard, some are too ""dry,"" some are too plain. Without a doubt, Blue Diamond produces the best-tasting almonds. I have had many different brands of almonds and if you are eating them out of the bag (IE, not cooking with them or mixing them with something), quality can go a long way. Blue Diamond almonds are very flavorful on their own. I typically do not like a completely plain almond, so decided to try their Bold series.<br /><br />The Bold Series has several different flavors. Some of these are hit and miss with me. Some of the flavors are ""too"" bold, and some taste great the first few almonds, but quickly overwhelm you. Since my favorite Blue Diamond product is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSX4D2"">Blue Diamond Almonds Roasted Salted, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a>, I thought I would give these a try.  I have been disappointed with other products within their Bold line, but these aren't too bad.<br /><br />You can definitely taste the salt and vinegar, and it's pretty much the same amount of flavor you would find with Salt and Vinegar potato chips.  Normally, I can eat half a can of Blue Diamond almonds in one sitting, however the strong flavor of the vinegar overwhelms me a bit and I can usually only eat half a serving of these at once.  If you're a big Salt and Vinegar fan however, these shouldn't be a problem.  While the Salt and Vinegar Almonds aren't my favorite in the Bold line, I do like them much better than the other varieties, and will probably get them again.  If you've never tried them before, you may want to start with purchasing just one can rather than 12."
1,"I wanted more wasabi flavor but there is enough for a good balanced taste. Really, they are pretty good. You can actually find these in walmart for $3 a can so its about the same as buying here."
1,these are the best flavor - very nice lime/chile taste goes great with the almonds. i agree with ms.cox!
1,"I'll start off by noting that I love almonds, I eat almonds every day, and I particularly love Blue Diamond almonds. The most important qualities of almonds, for me, are freshness, quality, and careful roasting. Blue Diamond almonds get 5 stars on all those parameters.<br /><br />And I've tried all their flavors, especially their ""BOLD"" line. Alas, their definition of ""BOLD"" is apparently ""a little too spicy for kids."" This flavor is okay, as a change of pace, but doesn't exactly set my taste buds a-""blazin'."" It doesn't taste like Buffalo wings -- it's too sweet and not vinegary enough. And it's definitely not spicy enough. I realize that real Buffalo wing spice can be brutal, and might not suit a mass-market snacking product. But really, they haven't even tried here. There's not even a hint of Tabasco, for example.<br /><br />As I said, this is a pleasant enough flavor, especially if you need a little change from, say, my favorite, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4QJK"">Jalapeno Smokehouse</a>. But it doesn't taste much like anything in particular. They could have called it ""BOLD Generic Faux-Spicy Snack to be Eaten Brainlessly While Watching the Game"" flavor and it would have been more accurate."
1,"I love the product, they have great taste, easy to order and we did not have a long wait time to recieve them. I will order again."
1,"My fav bold BD almond by far. Completely addicting. TY Lord that they are pretty expensive. Not the best nut though. That distinction, of course, goes to Mauna Loa garlic and onion fav Mac."
1,"It took two or three cans, but I love these now.  When I first tried these, I thought the taste was not as ""bold"" as I would like it to be.  I do wish they were a tad stronger and hotter on the wasabi taste, but I am hooked on these now.  I eat some almost every day."
0,"These have no bite at all...Nothing. They should scratch off the ""Wasabi"" from the label... on the verge of false advertisibg...""Bold""...My behind...the only reason for 2 stars is that they are at least Almonds...."
0,"I didn't like these.<br />I guess it's my fault for not liking them, because I actually have never tried wasabi, but I like asian flavors in food and adore all of Blue Diamond's bold flavors, so when I saw this in the store, I was like hey why not.<br /><br />Now I know why not. These nuts were horrific...they had this...harsh acerbic taste to them that I just could not enjoy. I ended up wiping most of the flavoring off and chopping the nuts up to put in stuff like salads. The nuts themselves are high quality and always taste fresh, so at least I was able to get some use from them. However, I would never  buy these again and if you are not experienced with wasabi, you may want to think twice before buying them lol."
0,I used to love the smokehouse almonds but the last few cans I bought SUCKED! Bland with little flavor.  Does anyone know if they changed ingredients or recipes or something?
0,"I picked up a can of these after the glowing reviews I read for it. To keep it short, it has a very authentic wasabi taste. It literally tastes like an almond dipped in wasabi sauce. And that, to me, doesn't make the most appealing snack. I find the wasabi flavor overwhelming, and none of the soy flavor coming through. I thought it'd come through as a more balanced flavor, but that's not the case. I won't be eating anymore, personally. I gave it two stars since it is wasabi flavor, and it certainly tastes like that."
0,"Tastes like a poor Ranch fav almond. Barely any lime. What are these 5 star reviewers eatting anyway. Proably the wasaibi and soy bold BD almonds. Save your money and calories, do not buy these. Buy extra wasaibi."
0,"I deserved to get a nasty product when I selected a product flavored with Wasabi and Soy Sauce.  If you really like Wasabi and Soy Sauce, buy this product.  The nuts are of a high quality."
1,"I'd been buying it for years WHEN I COULD FIND IT, at the local grocery. Generally buying 5 or 6 cans cause I couldn't be sure it would be there next time I went. As such, I was thrilled to see Amazon selling it in bulk and cheaper than at my local store.<br /><br />These are almonds... so you get the health benefits of that. They are very tasty, with a mild wasabi tang... I've shared them with friends and they love them.<br /><br />Granted, these don't provide the entertainment value of the wasabi peas from the Japanese place that blow out your sinuses. But Its still a very tasty, semi healthy (lots of salt), snack that fills my need for something crunchy.<br /><br />MUCH healthier than potato chips."
1,"This is one of my favorites in the Blue Diamond ""BOLD"" flavors line. There's a nice balance of heat vs sweet, and the saltiness isn't overwhelming. You can eat 'em by the handful, and probably will once you taste them.<br /><br /> However, true hot-pepper fans know that the heat of the Habanero pepper is a fearsome thing. You won't find much of it here, just a little hint. That's probably for the best, given that most people can't tolerate the blazing intensity of those devilish little peppers. But I kind of wish Blue Diamond would put out a ""BOLD, and This Time We Mean It"" line for those of us who really do love spicy foods."
1,"OH MY WORD!! I love these, I love the bold flavored Blue Diamond almonds. Love this flavor first, then the wasabi then the salt vinegar. The Wasabi has a gram or so more of carbs, so I generally choose this one or the salt and vinegar. The problem for me is I'm an addict. If I got 3 pounds of these almonds, I'd eat 3 pounds of these almonds in short order. That being said. They are delicious, salty, a little spicy with a touch of sweeet - they are fantastic! This price is better than I get them at Wally World for the 6oz can and they are cheaper there than anywhere else. So, buy these, buy them now and hide the other bags from yourself (or send them to me) ...they are SO good, I'm eating them now! :<br /><br />Hey Amazon, this is sold and shipped by you, it would be ever so nice if this came on the subscribe and save!"
1,These taste great but aren't even as spicy as something that would be labeled jalapeno. I will still buy these but if you are expecting spicy don't be surprised for mild.
1,"Wasabi!  Almonds!  What's not to love?  Can't stop eating these, glad they come in packs of six..."
1,"Blue Diamond Bold Jalapeno Smokehouse Almonds are a great snack.  Almonds are one of the healthiest nuts that you can eat, and the Jalapeno Smokehouse flavor is very similar to chipotle.  This isn't too surprising since a chipotle is a smoked jalapeno after all.  From a nutrition stand point, the only special consideration that doesn't come will all almonds is the 180 mg of sodium per serving.  Unless you get a plain, unsalted nut this is pretty typical.  I like to keep a can of these either in my desk or in the pantry at home for snacking.  Grabbing a handful of these is great between meals when hunger strikes.  So if you are looking for a spicy snack that is fairly healthy, give these a try."
1,"I just tried these for the first time last night...and wow, what a product! The lime and chili combination for these almonds is AMAZING. The flavor is INTENSE, powerful and oh, so delicious!! I am going to buy a bunch more of these to snack on, and I have to say, I will be snacking on THESE almonds for a long time to come. And seriously - I'm salivating while I write this!! I'm going to go eat some right now!"
1,These are great! I can't stop eating these! The amount of wasabi flavor was perfect for me. I am definitely going to have to try the other flavors
1,I absolutely love these salt and vinegar almonds!!!<br />Being a fan of salt and vinegar potato chips when I saw these I knew I had to try them. Finished off the can within a couple days!! These are truly very good!!  My only problem is I couldn't find them again in any store around here so I remembered my fav place to shop Amazon.com and knew they wouldn't fail me! Thank you!!
1,first of all -- they're good.  really good.  go back for more and lick the bowl when they're gone - good.<br /><br />That said -- they're not quite as bold as you might hope.  I mean -- I'm from Texas.  Bold should be really BOLD.  But they are good -- so we'll just overlook it.  Yummy.<br /><br />And they are almonds -- one of those wonder nuts so full of B vitamins and other good stuff that you should be eating an ounce a day just for health sake.  But they're good enough that it's not exactly an intelligence test whether you'll want to eat them.

1,"These almonds are my favorite flavor from Blue Diamond. Not too sweet, not too spicy. More sweet than spicy though so I wouldn't be afraid of getting it even if you can't normally handle spicy foods."
1,these almonds are totally addictive!!!  and deeeelicious!<br />the best way to buy them that i've found is through this deal.  costs way more in stores.
1,"I love sensational flavors and these almonds really deliver.<br />They get sprinkled on many of my Thai dishes, stir fries, and fried rice medleys for extra crunch, calcium, fiber, and protein."
1,"I don't know what the other person is talking about, these nuts are delicious!  Granted they're not your organic, all natural stuff, but what did you expect from a fusion buffalo wing almond!"
1,"Seriously, these things are delicious.  Amazon is a great place to buy them too.  At my local grocer they are $6 a can.  Can't go wrong!"
1,"These are great, and I love the bulk purchase with Amazon. Worst danger is that you want to eat more than you should because they are really very good."
1,These are gggrrreeeaattt tasting almonds! Got these directly from Amazon and glad I did as they are a bit tough to find around here. Nice spice to them!
1,These almonds are very tasty.  I eat them alone and sometimes mix them with plain Greek yogurt for a delicious and healthy treat.  You can't find this flavor in most stores and the typical Blue Diamond can is much more expensive else where.
1,"I am so thankful that Amazon has these wonderful almonds! Our WalMarts used to carry them and made a big mistake discontinuing them. There are six people in my office alone that LOVE these Jalapeno almonds and we have looked everywhere for them! I hope we will always be able to find them here!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4QJK"">Blue Diamond Almonds, Bold Jalapeno Smokehouse, 6-Ounce Can (Pack of 6)</a>"
1,"If you like snacks that are a healthier alternative to other options, almonds are a great way to go.  These particular almonds pack a lot of flavor and kick.  They are great for a quick snack that is full of flavor.  They are delicious."
1,"Wow is what you'll say when chomping on these nuts.  They're very tasty and addictive, as stated in the other reviews.  If you like wasabi or horseradish, you'll love these.  My mom says almonds help you sleep and for the last week I've slept great.  If you like bold flavor, I strongly recommend them."
1,"I love wasabi....and these almonds are AWESOME!  They taste better than any other ""flavor enhanced"" almonds on the market."
1,"Regular salted almonds are okay but tend to be boring after awhile.  But Blue Diamond Jalapeno Smokehouse almonds are just amazing.  I could eat an entire can in one sitting no problem, probably two cans.  I was tempted to give these nuts just 1 star because I'm afraid they're going to make me fat and broke!  FYI, I also tried the Wasabi & Soy Sauce almonds--absolutely no comparison, the Jalapeno Smokehouse blow them out of the water (at least to my taste buds)."
1,"Tried the almonds today for the first time.  I'm ordering a case right now.  Best ever, ever, ever!!!"
1,"These almonds are delicious. When you first start chewing, they taste like the plain Smokehouse brand. After a few seconds the Jalapeno heat kicks in. Not overwhelming but just enough to make the snack wanting you to eat a few more. Only bad part is that they are not available in the 38oz tub or jar like the Habanero BBQ flavor that is a better value. If you like them as I do, you can go through a 6oz can very quickly."
1,"The title says it all.<br /><br />The wasabi+soy flavors combine to a deliciousness that is out of this world.  If you haven't tried them yet, you're missing out."
1,"I became hooked on these tasty tidbits, but after a while, I couldn't find them at my local stores anymore.  I tried Amazon and found I could order them in packs of six.  While the price is a little higher than I'd like, that is overridden by the fact that I can indeed get them, and they are delivered right to my door.  Ordering two packs gives me free shipping, too. These almonds are delicious by themselves, but when mixed with dark chocolate, they become irresistible.  The yummy recipe goes like this: take two almonds and one Hershey's dark chocolate kiss.  Pop the two almonds in your mouth and chew a little. Then pop in the chocolate kiss and chew, mixing the two together.  Sheer bliss!  I've become addicted and don't know what I'd do if these flavored almonds ever become unavailable."
1,"Great flavor. I have always ordered Blue Diamond wasabi almonds but these come in a convenient snack bag I can throw in my purse. My colleagues are always digging around in my purse now because they know I have tasty snacks. So the only drawback is that people want me to share. Which means they are that good! Hey, I should also get a five-star rating for feeding my friends."
1,These almonds are so yummy! I ordered them online because both of my stores were always out. Walmart and Target is where I get them. I go through these very quickly. I like spicy foods so to me they are not hot but just right.
1,"Wow! These are amazingly tasty! Addictive, even. I only wish they were easier to find!"
1,"If you love Salt and Vinegar chips then you can't help but love these almonds, they are sooooooooooooooooooooo good!  Yes, the almonds have fat (much like chips) but at least its a good fat for you!"
1,"I love salt & vinegar chips and I love Blue Diamond almonds so I was delighted to find a combination of the two.  They make a great snack and a great substitute for chips with a sandwich.  They are a little tart and a little sweet, YUMMY!"

1,"These almond flavor by this company brand is simply the best by far.  Great flavor that has the essence of true BBQ taste that is not too spicy.  A great snack whenever and wherever,  you may not be able to eat just one.  to tell the truth,  you might find yourself telling people to keep there hands off your nuts.  yummy!"
1,"Lime and Chili seemed a strange combination but the Lime Flavor is natural, not sweet, just tart enough to bring out the chili spice to create a great tasting nut treat to snack on.  Almonds are a great, fun snack and having one that has a Lime Tart Flavor is absolutely Fabulous.  Even better is that Amazon delivers three full one pound packages for less than the price this item normally retails for in Stores, IF you can even get it in your favorite store."
1,These things are amazing.  I can't eat less than half a can at a sitting.  Probably my favorite snack right now.
1,"Blue Diamond almonds are by far my favorite for flavor and texture. My only minimal complaint about these is that they are very minimally spicy. I was afraid to go for Habenero in case they were TOO spicy, but given that these are much more mild than Jalepenos I will go for Habanero next order."
1,"I would just like to say that this company producing roasted almonds is by far the best tasting almonds I have ever had...they are the perfect most tastiest treat on the go whenever you need one and it is really pleasing to have. Its heart food and I like it. This will be a staple snack for me FOREVER :D if anyone in the company reads this comment, I really encourage you to make a WIDE ARRAY of flavors...it would be very interesting and unique. You guys have A LOT of good ones now..but imagine other possibilities. GO AT IT :D!!!"
1,"The Blue Diamond Jalapeno Smokehouse Almonds are great tasting, with a strong smoky flavor and a nice jalapeno bite. These have a decent amount of spicy heat to them, but it isn't too overpowering. My wife picked these up for a long road trip and they were the first snack to get finished up.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH"
1,"Great BBQ flavor with enough Habanero to give it a nice little kick.  The flavors are not overwhelming, so the taste of the almond still shines through.  A really nice snack that's just a little different."
1,"These Salt and Vinegar Almonds are one of the best snack foods I have ever tasted!  They're just tangy enough to give you a good kick.  Hard to find in my local stores, so I came to Amazon and bought a case  :-)"
1,"These are the best snack food ever! Spicy AND healthy. The 100-calorie packs are a blessing 'cause I could gorge on them. The only drawback is they make your fingers messy, but that's a small price to pay."
1,"I originally found the big jar of these at Costco. They had them for about a minute and then they were gone. Thank goodness for Amazon, because I'm hooked on these almonds. If you like anything salt & vinegar, you'll love 'em! Now if Amazon could offer the large economy-size jar, all would be right with the world."
1,"I love these so much. If you like salt and vinegar chips and you like almonds, you will love these too. They're hard to find in the store but Amazon has you covered."
1,"I do like the Lime taste. It's pretty strong, and very unique. However, at no point in time did I feel like I was eating ""Lime and Chili"" almonds. There was absolutely no kick from the chili.<br /><br />Very tasty still, but not what I was hoping for."
1,These are my favorite flavored almonds!  Intense flavor!  I can't get enough lime.  Hard to find in the stores though sometimes.
1,"This wonderful combination of flavors proves to me that heaven truly exists. If you are a fan of Salt & Vinegar chips, you will LOVE these almonds! I've been through 2 cases of it and counting... shhhhhhhh!"
1,These are the best nuts ever and the value is best with the 6 pack.
1,"I don't need to say much more, these are good. Not really hot like you might assume given that it's jalapeno flavor. They just have a slight kick."
1,"Fantastic bold citrusy flavor.  Not very spicy, but quite savory.  Packet size is just right for a single serving snack."
1,Great way to purchase the Wasabi & Soy Almonds -- makes it easier to resist the temptation to eat too many!!
1,"VERY GOOD SERVICE, FABULOUS PRODUCT, VERY FRESH, EXTREMELY WELL PACKED.  WILL MOST DEFINITELY ORDER AGAIN."
1,Both the Bold Jalapeno and the Wasabi Soy almonds have taste great and make a good snack or party treat.
1,"I love these almonds - they are the perfect snack, you don't need to eat a lot to feel satisfied. Also, since they have a lot of flavor, you feel ""mouth-satisfied"" as well. The wasabi is not too hot (actually I wish it were just a little hotter) and the soy just adds a little bit of saltiness. I recommend these if you like wasabi peas but want something with more nutritional value."
1,"This is my favorite flavor but all the BOLD flavors are helping me stay on my low carb diet.  They taste great, crunchy, mouth full of flavor.  My whole office is now eating my ""diet food.""  If the sodium is high for your diet, mix them 50:50 with plain unsalted almonds. just YUMMY!"
1,Love the taste not to hot but a little tangy.  Price is good and really good service.
1,"I am on the Atkins diet, have been for four years, and almonds are an important part of snacking, these almonds are delicious. I have found blue diamond to be so fresh, and the salt and vinegar satisfy a multitude of cravings."
1,"Almonds are super nutritional food and while high in fat, are certainly better than cheese puffs!"
1,"These are very good.<br />Like salt-and-vinegar potato chips, but more substantial and delicious. The almond gives a nice hint of sweetness under the assault of the vinegar. I've eaten 2/3rds a can at one sitting."
1,This was sent as a gift.  More than once I was told how happily they munched on these.  Always feel good to give a winner.
1,The Habanero BBQ are awesome. They are the perfect balance of sweet and heat. I eat them all day long.
1,I purchased these Blue Diamond Wasabi Almonds to try out for a snack and they are GREAT.  They are good as a snack between meals and they are quite filling.  My husband really loves the flavor of these Almonds.  I have already purchased another supply.  The price is so much less than at the grocery store and I get them right at my door step.
1,"To start I should say I HATE Almonds. I don't dislike them, I hate them (and I have tried all manner of almonds, from raw to various flavors). A former co-worker brought a huge jug of these to work and urged me to give one a try. Like the stubborn child who refuses to eat her veggies, I popped one in my mouth, with a large glass of water in hand to wash down what I expected to be the awful (to me) flavor. I was shocked to find I not only didn't object to these, but became hooked on them in short order.<br /><br />I have been unable to find this flavor in the mega jug my co-worked purchased at a big box retailer over a year ago and was pleased to find this option on Amazon for a price lower than my local grogery store. I wish that big jug were available, but these smaller cans probably assure a fresher product.<br /><br />I will add, that I am a big fan of vinegar, but am not a big fan of salt and vinegar chips. These almonds have an excellent balance of flavor."
1,"The Blue Diamond Lime Chili flavored almonds is the best flavor hands down.  Packages came sealed, and the almonds were fresh and delicious!  You should also try the Blazing Buffalo Wing and Habanero BBQ. The Wasabi and Soy were too salty for me though."
1,"These are awesome. And good for you to boot. Sure there's probably a little too much salt, but everything in moderation, right..."
1,"I love the lime and chili almonds from blue diamond and they are a great snack if you are on a low carb diet. In addition buying the 3-pack of 16oz bags at amazon is a great deal considering that the 6oz can usually costs $3.79 at my grocery store. At first I thought ""When am I ever going to finish 3x 16oz bags of almonds"" but that's no problem at all. I even have to trick myself and put just a few in a bowl so I won't eat half the bag on one evening. I am addicted to lime and chili almonds and I am O.K. with it. I hope you will enjoy them too."
1,Blue Diamond almonds are a huge favorite and I like trying all the flavors that they have.  These Habanero BBQ almonds are not spicy and actually have a sweet taste to it due to the bbq flavoring.  Would have liked them to be a bit hotter but taste pretty good as is!
1,I am so delighted to get these Salt and vinegar Almonds.  None of the stores near me carry them.  They are actually great for my diet.  I can eat as many as I like yet the amount has less calories than if I was eating chips.  I can only eat so many nuts at a time while I can pig out on chips and waste lots of calories. My friends are always digging in my closet to see if I have any when they visit.  Love them.<br /><br />mls
1,"We discovered these Blue Diamond almond snacks while on vacation a couple of months ago.  We loved them!  Our favorites are the Lime and Chili as well as the Salt and Vinegar.  They are very tasty as well as healthy.  When we got home, we purchased them from Amazon.  We bought the 1.5 ounce snack bags.  They are perfect for lunches or travel snacks.  They also help with portion control!<br />By purchasing them in bulk from Amazon, we are able to get them for $1 or less per bag.  When we purchased them from a convenience store on our vacation we paid $2+ per bag.  It's a great savings to buy them here."
1,My whole family loves these almonds. We're buying a pack of 12 about once a month. Great price (even cheaper than what we've been able to find at the grocery store). Great quality. Healthier than salt & vinegar chips :) Wish Amazon had this item as a Subscribe and Save!!
1,"The Bold Habanero BBQ flavor is amazing!!!  Plain almonds are very tasteless and hard to eat.  However, they are such a powerful and healthy food, I work them into my diet several days a week.  With flavors like this, it makes it very easy to do so.  The price you pay for these on Amazon is second to none!"
1,I absolutely love the new bold Salt & Vinegar almonds by Blue Diamond! It just doesn't get any better than this!
1,"A great flavor and 4g net carbs, 2g sugars. Nearly guilt-free snacking and an awesome amount of fat. These aren't the ideal nut for low-carb and/or keto diets, macadamias are probably closer, but these are much more widely available and the flavors make it easier to snack reasonably."
1,These Soy & Wasabi almonds from Blue Diamond are my absolute favorite - just enough kick & the almonds tide you over until mealtime. The resealable bag keeps them nice & fresh.  Love them!!
1,"I love all these different flavors that they have come out with for Blue Diamond almonds.  Soooo Goood.  While this one wasn't as good as the Wasabi flavor, it was still delicious."
1,First tried these at my work vending started buying them everyday $1.25 per 2ozs. (WOW)  Went o Amazon and saw I could get them cheaper so I order 6 bags took them on vacation with me my family loved them all of them wanted to know where to buy them they are just diffrent and that little warm bang surprise is good.  Will contiue to but these.  Good flavor and good price for the larger bag!
1,These almonds just have a great flavor.  Just the right amount of heat.  It's hard to stop eating them.  Good thing my wife is here to stop me.
1,These are a delicious and healthy snack when eaten in moderation. The flavor is great and isn't too over powering at all. The wasabi flavor is strong and feels like it's going to be hot but the heat never really shows up.
1,"The taste of these almonds are addictive.  They are spicy, but not too hot like you'd think a habanero would be.  It's been hard to stay out of them and I eat too many in a day.  The price from this seller is stellar and about the same price (per lb) that I find at walmart for a small can.<br />We will re-order soon as the almonds are almost gone  :-)"
1,"I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack.  This one while good was not great for me.  When I hear the word ""Bold"" I expect something over the top and this one was just sort of medium.  It seems that they aimed for the middle of the road when it comes to being a spicy flavor!  We have Buffalo Wing restaurants here that offer about 6 grades of spiciness from hot to death and this wasn't even close.<br /><br />If I compare this to the Blue Diamond Wasabi & Soy spiciness it is not even in the same galaxy.  This is still a good flavor but not what I was expecting.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor does have 9% of your daily intake of sodium which is almost twice the amount in many of the other Blue Diamond flavors. It has even 50% more salt than the Bold Salt `n Vinegar flavor? For that reason I will eat this flavor more sparingly.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you, just watch the salt.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them. Since they have a more moderate flavor than what I was expecting for a ""Bold"" product and contain so much salt I gave it 4 stars.  I eat these almonds because they taste good and are healthier for you but the extra salt in this one negates some of the health benefits in my opinion. This is still a good flavor and I like them but not love them!"
1,"These are delicious. I will buy them again and again. They are not for everyone, but if you like wasabi peas, you will love these. The flavoring works great with the taste of almonds."
1,"These vitamins are sweet and sour gummies that are easy on a pregnant girls' tummy. I personally do not enjoy them, but they keep the nutrition down. I totally recommend these. However, if it is summer time, buy them from Target. You're safe to order them from Amazon if it isn't extremely hot out..."
1,"I found these in a local grocery store and they were quite expensive $4.50 each. I checked on Amazon and found them much cheaper. They taste like shortbread cookies and are quite delicious. However, mine arrived with a few broken pieces."
1,"Russell Stover sugar-free candies are usually good and taste similar to their equivalents made with sugar.  This one is similar to a Snickers bar (but smaller size), and since so few other sugar-free versions exist, this is a real find.  It lasts on the shelf without melting or breaking (as some sugar-free products do), and has a natural aftertastes (not chemical at all).  I'll buy more when they get them back in stock."
1,"This is another great product in the Hi-Tor line.  Please see my review for the Neo canned diet for a lengthier review -- it all applies to this Dry Neo food too.  My older dogs who have had kidney disease have had teeth pulled by the vet.  The Dry Neo diet has small chunks & is easy to eat.  All my dogs like the flavor & have not refused the food - ever.  Because the chunks are small, they are easy to moisten with water for the dogs who need to *gum* their meals. I have to take a city bus to get to my vet now.  Ordering my Hi-Tor foods thru Amazon & having it come to my door has been a God send.  It is less expensive than what I get from the vet, I can buy it whenever I want, & it comes right to my door!!  Hi-Tor has done a great job for years supplying pet owners with Special Diets.  I have told all my friends about them & heartily recommend them."
1,"My dog was recently diagnosed with kidney disease and the vet recommended the k/d diet.  I bought a 5lb bag at the vet's office for $32.00 of Hill's Prescription K/D dry dog food.  The vet told me that there were different brands and I'd have to experiment to find out which one my dog would like.  Not knowing that I would need a prescription for such dog food I went home without a prescription.<br /><br />My dog seemed to like the food - so knowing that a 5lb bag wouldn't last long I went in search of this special dog food. I went from store to store trying to find the k/d diet dog food.  I quickly found out I would need a prescription - of which the vet had to mail to me.  Even with the prescription you can only buy this special dog food from a vet's office.  Well for me - that's totally inconvenient.  My vet's office is a 1/2 hour drive away and with my work schedule and kids - it's not always convenient to drive for an hour just to get dog food.<br /><br />At one store I found the Hi-Tor Neo Diet food which could be bought without a prescription.  The clerk there was exetremely knowledgable and helpful.  She told me that the Hi-Tor Neo Dog food was actually better than the Hill's Prescription k/d.  I thought I  would try it since the 10lb bag was $24.99.  My dog loved it!  The clerk told me that they might not carry this brand for much longer so I went on the internet and found that Amazon carries this product. Even with shipping I'll be saving more than half of what I would spend at the vet's for a 10lb bag - not to mention the cost of gas and my time for a round trip.  I compared the labels and I do believe that Hi-Tor is actually better than the prescription brand.  In short, it's better for my dog, my dog likes it, I don't need a prescription and it's half the price with more convenience than the other dog food - what's not to love about it?"
1,"My wife liked these as much if not more than Haystacks from Russel Stovers Chocolates.  If you like Haystacks / Coconut clusters, these will do.<br /><br />Chris"
1,"I received this order late (according to the tracking information I received).  Oddly enough, the shipping box arrived in perfect condition, BUT the actual tin that the tea came in was dented.  This may not mean much, except you pay quite the price for the tin, and I found the dented tin annoying.  I can only ""assume"" the company sent me a dented tin, based on the shipping box."
0,"So this company markets Samurai Rice Crackers and Oriental Rice Crackers.  I was under the mistaken impression the Samurai version would be spicy.  They're not.  I got 8 packages.  And none have been spicy.  There may be a subtle hint of heat.  But very subtle.<br /><br />I love rice crackers for whatever reason.  But I could've bought plain rice crackers locally for less.  This product is selling for close to 4 bucks a pound + shipping.  The bins at Whole Foods, Publix and Fresh Market have it for close to the same price + no shipping.  I also have purchased a better-tasting variety at Big Lots, 1 buck for about 12 oz.<br /><br />What I will say is that it appears these crackers are made for long-term storage.  They're in a thick bag that I can't open with just my bare hands.  They're really sealed up.  If you want to still have rice crackers during a hurricane or if that big earthquake hits, this is a great buy."
1,"If you are looking for a good, mild, oriental rice cracker mix, this is it! Taste is fantastic, price very reasonable.  The down side is the shipping, which costs more than the total of 4 or 5 products!<br />But I would still recommend."
1,This is a great treat for my 3 dogs. It keeps them busy and full in between meals. Can keep enough on hand. :o)
1,I love all of the Beefeaters products but this is the very best according to my dogs! My four labs love really these treats!  I believe this product is healthier than most dog treats and give them to my dogs often. They enjoy all of the different sizes and it's nice to have options (e.g. quick treat or slow treat).  I highly recommend these treats!
1,These are the favorite treats for my two Westies. It keeps them busy and they have never had any issues with digestion.
1,"These treats are huge, and they sell them at the boutique dog shops for $4.99 for one, so I'm happy to buy them in ""bulk"".  They work really well with my dogs because for some reason, my dogs don't like just plain old rawhide.  They like the chicken on top.  I don't buy the flavored rawhide because it usually stains.  And these treats last a long time."
1,"As a professional petsitter, I am always looking for tasty ""rewards"" for my canine clients. They all love their Beefeater rawhides rolls with chicken meat.  Although they are alittle pricey, seeing how much they enjoy them is worth the extra expense.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00176DXW8"">Beefeaters Rawhide Roll with Chicken Meat, 5-Inch</a>"
0,My dogs love the flavor of these things and they can spend hours chewing on them.  The problem is they are SO MESSY.  They are covered in chicken that flakes off all over the place.  I like the concept of chicken covered rawhide but I need to find ones that don't require a vacuum!!
0,"Seriously, what could POSSIBLY be in these thing to make them worth so much?!?<br /><br />I thought Target was on crack asking $14.99!!<br /><br />Last time I checked Rawhide was the skin of a cow? Is this beacuse they can't make leather jackets out of it?"
1,I used to live close to Fastachi and went there often to purchase nuts for myself as well as friends and family for holidays and house warming. They roast the nuts there in the shop. The cashews just melt in your mouth they are so fresh. The mixes they offer are awesome. I personally love the cranberry nut mix. I was surprised and delighted to see they can be purchased here on Amazon! You won't be disappointed! Enjoy!
1,Never mind the nuts are packaged in a brown bag. My family thoroughly enjoyed snacking on Fastachi Super Nut Mix.  I have since purchased this mix again and other mixes packaged in tins to give as gifts.
1,"If you like nuts, wait until you try this Fastachi mix. The nuts are carefully selected, none are broken, they are hand roasted in small batches and a light sea salt adds to the goodness.<br />Perfection! Impossible to find a better product anywhere.  I have used many of the Fastachi products and am always amazed - never disappointed."
1,"My favorite snack is mixed  nuts without peanuts. These nuts are frest and delicious, with a nice salting. A nice blend, different from the canned variety. They come one pound in a paper bag with a sealed plastic  bag outside that. So you will want to put them in a sealed container. Delicious! I don't usually write reviews, but I wanted to let the seller know how much I liked them.<br />Jim"
0,"I purchased these nuts as a gift and was disappointed when they arrived in a small brown paper bag, not a nice tin or box as I expected. I would not order again."
1,"Having owned a coffee (retail) business for 14 years, I found the Altura Organic San Francisco blend to be one of the best packaged blends I've ever tasted.  Rich deep flavor showing that this company understands.  Highly recommended."
1,"I bought two bags of the Altura whole bean coffee off an Amazon special. The price was great, the surprise is how wonderful the coffee is! Deep, dark, oily, fragrant beans, high moisture content, rich flavor and aroma. I had to cut down my normal scoop levels this coffee is so rich."
1,"If you like a big-flavored, dark roast...Altura organic is hard to beat.<br />I do a French Press every morning...I like it even more than Pete's. Took it to my brother, a discriminating cappuccino drinker...he has now switched to Altura's San Fran Blend.Even if the bag is marked Swiss process decaf on the side of the bag, it is definitely full-test!Confirmed by a call to Altura and the strong jolt I receive from one cup!<br /><br />My only question is how does Amazon sell it for only $14.77 for 2 LBs and no shipping (On Subscription)..I just hope it lasts, because I am a huge fan."
1,I drink a lot of coffee and this ranks with the best.  Beans are dark and delicious when ground.  Good packaging.
1,"I've been a long-time loyalist to Cafe Altura's Dark French Roast, but wanted to try something new.  The San Francisco Blend is just as bold as the dark French, but has a brighter smell that reminds me of San Francisco in the Spring.  Highly recommended."
1,"Smooth, rich, flavorful!  The beans are so rich and dark they almost disappear in the predawn moonlight except.  I can wake up just smelling them grinding each morning.  I tried a wide variety of coffes in my life but this is hands down my favorite!  If I can't get it, the other Altura blends are almost as good."
1,This coffee is the household staple.  Love the all around flavor and darkness.  Great with or without sugar and easy on the palette.  Auto ship is the best!
1,"Cafe Altura's San Francisco Blend is a delicious, dark blend.  My boyfriend remarked just this morning that the aroma filling the air after I ground the beans was ""just like GOOD coffee is supposed to smell.""  I like this variety second only to Cafe Altura's Biodynamic French Roast.  They are both great... the french roast just has a bit more of a ""pure"" quality to it.  Both are a great deal when purchased through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program!"
1,I like a deep roasted aromatic coffee that can stand up to a huge slosh of half and half. This one can. I'll buy again.
1,We really enjoyed the coffee!  We used to drink Starbucks House Blend.  This  coffee is just better!
1,"I had initially written a poor review for this coffee.  However, I tried it again and I've developed a newfound appreciation for what they have here.<br /><br />It is rare to find a true french roast in a consumer branded coffee.  Most of what is called a french roast is really a full city roast (sometimes not even that).  The difference is stark.  However, I blame Starbucks for giving me a taste for a full french roasted bean.  And that is at least partially what you get here.  I'd estimate the blend at about 40% full french roast and the rest ranging from full city to full city roast +.  The net effect is a strong cup of coffee that, yes, will taste a bit scorched if you aren't accustomed to it.<br /><br />However, if you're looking for that same high octane kick that you get from Starbucks coffee then this may be the way to go.  However don't be surprised when you see very darkly roasted beans that are true full french roast.  Also, don't be surprised by a slightly higher caffeine kick!"
0,"This is the second, and last, time I will buy coffee from amazon.com.  The first time, I received a bag of coffee that had been out of date for months.  This time, it's still stale, but without a use-by date on the bag.  So much for trying to save some money and time.  I'll go back to making the trek to Whole Foods."
1,"This positive review is as much about the company, Cafe Altra as the product.  I had a problem with a recent shipment, via Amazon.  I contacted Cafe Altura directly via email.  They called me directly the very next morning.  They were professional and responsive in EVERY way (and friendly too!).  They handled my concern quickly and efficiently.  Even a bit later, when they realized a delay in my final resolution, they called me to advise there was a minor delay to resolution and wanted to make sure I knew they were handling my concern as promised.  Yes, they called me.  By the way, the concern was, in my opionion, relatively minor but I was treated like it was a major issue.  I will definiately continue to buy this coffee brand because of both 1) excellent coffee and 2) a company that backs their product with excellend customer service.  I do want to state that I might have been lucky in that I was contacted within about 12 hours of my concern (via phone, not email reply) and I don't want to sound like we could all expect that every time should a problem arise, but my experience was close to perfection and I would not be surprised if this level of service is the norm.  Excellent all around."
0,"I don't know if I got a bad bag, but the beans that I received smelled extremely funky.  Almost fishy.  The coffee that they made was decent, certainly better than I would have expected given the smell of the un-ground beans.  Nevertheless, I threw most of the package away, as I couldn't stand the smell of the beans, even when only semi-conscious in the morning (before drinking coffee, of course)."
1,"I'm ecstatic that the best tasting coffee I've purchased in recent years is  also organic, environmental, etc."
1,"My boyfriend and I LOVE this tea. Though it doesn't necessarily feel as though it ""cleanses"" you, it certainly makes you feel clean. Typically cleansing teas taste awful but the Bija tea has a wonderful taste. It is my favorite tea by far."
1,"Deep Cleanse from Bija provides a strong cinnamon flavor while providing you with the most powerful detoxifying herbs such as burdock root, dandelion root, licorice root, fennel seed, nettle leaf, oatstraw herb and yellow dock root! Adding this tea to your diet will definitely help you to look and feel better!"
1,"I don't just limit this sauce to dipping in gyoza (although nothing on earth can beat it for dipping in some fresh, hot gyoza!). It is wonderful on almost anything. I add it to steamed veggies, meatloaf, even to baked macaroni and cheese. It is so delicious and adds a fantastic flavor to pretty much anything you can imagine."
1,"Dynasty Potsticker Sauce is a winner!  It's as tasty as any I've had in Chinese restaurants--the perfect blend of soy sauce and spices.  It complements the potsticker w/o overpowering its taste.  I love it, and am very hopeful that Amazon will again stock it--and SOON!"
0,"I'm giving this a one star because obviously there is a problem with the packaging seals on this product. The only reason I order is that I don't have time to go buy these at a local store which is about an hour from my house--thus ordering makes sense. Except that when my shipment arrives there are 3 packages out of the 6 boxes that are leaking. I open up the box and there is a terrible stench. Spoiled coconut water smells awful, especially in the 100 degree summer temps we've been having. So I unpack the boxes, and pour out the spoiled contents because of the smell, and then go to Amazon to try to report that 3 out of the 6 boxes in the package were damaged. Well, it looks like the only option is to return the package or request a refund. I need the other 3 boxes that were not leaking, and can't find an option to report this to anyone. Then I read the other reviews for this product and note that I'm not the only one whose experienced issues with leaking during shipment. Since there doesn't appear to be a way to be credited for only the items in the shipment that were leaking, and keep the others, and I would have had to get clean boxes and repack the horrible smelling boxes in new packaging to ship back, I just decided to keep the undamaged ones, and to let others know. I won't be ordering this size again in the future, and will just make the one hour trip to my grocer that carries the larger size and then buy locally in bulk next time.<br /><br />Note: if you try the product it is really good, but the packaging leaves a lot to be desired."
0,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:32 Mins<br /><br /></span>I have been on the coconut water wagon for over 2 years now.  I truly feel there is no better coconut water than the one that comes directly from the source in hand.  Because fresh coconuts are not easy to find I started buying Vita Coco over a year ago.  From all other coconut waters out there I felt theirs was the best tasting, best quality and I also liked the fact that the source of the water came from just one country and not multiple ones.  I have been a happy consumer for over a year, most of my purchases came from the local supermarket until I decided to purchase the vita coco 6 pack on Amazon as part of the subscribe and save program I gave a box to my mother in law. Earlier this week she opened one of the containers and she said the taste seemed a bit off, a little rancid and she felt like I had swallowed something more than just water. She decided to take a closer look and I was appalled at what she uncovered. Huge chunks of mold her water; it made her sick to her stomach. I am sad to say that after this experience we will no longer consume this product. My concern is what kind of quality control is out there and is this the first incident.  I have heard many reviews talking about rancid taste and moldy taste I wonder how many of those containers had the same stuff inside.  Worse of all is that I have been giving this water to my 3 year old who loves coconut water. My mother in law sealed the container and took these pictures I have contacted the company but I have yet to hear from anyone."
0,"Again, I had a problem with the product leaking ---  Both my original and replacement order. The manufacturer's packaging simply does not protect the contents enough. The box soaked through and this time, one of the top faces just tore right off because it was so damp.<br /><br />When I buy other liquids from Amazon such as the ""Zola Acai drink""<br />([...]), the plastic containers are better equipped to sustain the shipping process unlike these coconut water cartons.<br /><br />I really enjoy Vita Coco's coconut water products. The taste is light, refreshing and hardly sweet at all. And yes, it is thirst-quenching. However, I do not recommend this larger packaging size. The other tetra packaging for the smaller individual cartons is better equipped for impact. Since I lost much of the drink from the leakage on both orders, I cannot give a high rating. However, I will give credit where credit is due and Amazon has been prompt to respond to my concerns."
1,"This product also comes in the single serving size<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LL0R8I"">Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, 11.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12)</a><br />with little straws attached. The single-servings have 11.1 ounces, while the 34-ounce carton says it has four servings of 8.5 ounces each. I still drink about 11+ ounces per serving, so get a little more than 3 servings per carton.<br /><br />This is 100% pure natural coconut water, with no added sugar. The 8.5-ounce size serving contains 45 calories, 0 fat calories, 30mg of sodium, 515mg of potassium, 11g carbohydrate in the form of naturally-occurring sugars (no fiber), 0g protein, 4% of the daily value (based on a 2,000 calorie diet) of calcium, 4% daily value of phosphorous, 175% of the daily value of Vitamin C, 0% daily value of iron, and 8% daily value of magnesium. This means that Vita Coco 100% pure coconut water has more electrolytes, with 15 times more potassium, than leading sports drinks, without the added sugars and/or artificial sweeteners and other added ingredients (dyes, etc.)<br /><br />It gives excellent hydration. My only regret is that I didn't find Vita Coco before I did a 26.2-mile marathon back in 2002. I still take frequent walks, and with Vita Coco, I never cramp.<br /><br />I have noticed that my blood is clotting better/wounds are healing more quickly. I occasionally get small scratches from my cat, and have gotten various scratches from shrubbery encountered on my walks, and recently, a sharp knife got the better of me and I cut my fingertip. It was during these recent instances that I noticed the faster healing time and better blood clotting. I monitor my body's processes closely and can attribute these improvements, at least in large part, to consuming coconut water.<br /><br />Highly recommended!"
1,"My discovery of coconut water was brought on by a search for a natural alternative to Pedialite (There aren't many pronouncable ingredients in Pedialite and none I'd put in my baby's little body.) Coconut water is the best alternative, good for you, and the taste is simply refreshing. Not too sweet, but not boring either! A great solution to dehydration! This size is great to keep in the fridge. . . certainly more friendly to the environment! A great price on Amazon . . ."
0,"I ordered two boxes of 6 VitaCoco water.  I only received one box, so clearly I was miffed that I was missing half my order.  Making matters worse, after opening the box that contained the six Vitacocos, the packing cardboard was clearly wet, and indeed a box had burst and leaked Vitacoco water all over the insides.<br /><br />According to the Amazon returns policy, the items could not be returned, but customer service was willing to refund the purchase.  So kudos to Customer Service, but jeers for everything else."
0,"Amazon.com packed this product very well and the package was not damaged during shipment.<br /><br />The Vito Coco product I ordered and received (as titled) was not as good condition.  On 4 of the 34 oz boxes, the seals were broke slightly.  All 4 with broken seals were dripping very slightly - very noticeable as I held onto them.  The slight pressure used to hold them caused the dripping out of the seal before ever removing the seal. Two of the containers was smashed on the top - both of which were 2 of the 4 with broken seals. When I opened some of the shipping packages of these products, it smelled moldy.<br /><br />The seal for the opening is flimsy and could easily be damaged. Some of the seals were far too easy to remove - not the kind of seal you want to use for this heavy weight - 34 oz product.<br /><br />I only have one other coconut water to compare this product to, and that is the brand O.N.E.  Compared to O.N.E., the taste of this product was off - a taste of decay or mold. Some tasted moldier than others. I drank them all anyway (with no apparent ill affects), except for 3 of the 4 in which the seals were broken.  3 of the 4 with broken seals, I poured down the drain.<br /><br />The price of the 34 oz 6 pack product of Vita Coco is excellent in comparison to other coconut water brands on the market, but is it worth it?  Not to me.  I will not be buying this product again unless they improve IF the price remains the same."
1,"My family is from the West Indies.  This is a little sweeter than we're used to, but I would still say it's delicious.  It's the best I've had where I didn't literally stick the straw in the coconut."
1,"Vita Coco's packing was a fitted box with extra cardboard and probably not enough on it's own. Amazon's added heavy duty bubble wrap that had very little give (different to what I usually see for other items) and box was packed well and I got my Vita Coco in quick time and in perfect condition. No leaks, no dents, all 6 boxes tasted good! Will now consider the monthly subscription. I was hesitant based on the poor reviews I saw about packing...but I think Amazon seems to have fixed that. Also I got from the other reviews that there was a bad batch that got shipped out which affected a lot of people. It also seemed that most people got replacements which I would be fine with. Will buy again."
0,Vita Coco.  The most repulsive tasting coconut water on the market.  I won't be buying them again. I have had the plain flavor.
1,"I purchase both Zico and Vita, like both of it, but I think Vita is best in taste, zica kinda water down on taste.  From now on Vita will be my choice of coco water."
1,"First, let me note that there are several different manufacturers of these 1 liter bottles of coconut water. I have tried this variety (Vita Coco) and the Zico brand, which were comparable in price and quality. Both were delicious, though only about half the people here at the office that tried it shared that opinion. So young coconut water may be something of a specific taste.<br /><br />I'm a fan of coconut water (both Zico and Vita Coco) because they are very refreshing when served cold. As they claim, it does naturally contain some of the same compounds found in sports drinks that are supposed to speed hydration (take that with a grain of salt...water hydrates just as well as anything).<br /><br />But best of all - 34 fl. ounces (1L) of (Zico/Vita Coco) coconut water = ~173 calories. One can of coke (12 fl. oz) = ~143 calories (according to the label, other sites claim more). The cocount water also has a fair amount of potassium and a small amount of other vitamins, whereas cola has almost no nutritional value at all.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Both companies shipped my coconut water all the way to Afghanistan in good sturdy packaging too, I might add."
1,"I ordered for 12 containers of above coconut water of 34 ounces each. The packing was not good, actually one container was leaking.<br /><br />The taste of the Coconut water was as good as any other Coconut water that I have ordered from you in the past few years or from some other supplier.<br /><br />Please give me a ceredit for the one that was leaking on pro rata basis.<br /><br />Thanks."
0,"If I wanted to drink water that tastes like white bread: I'd drink Vita coco.  I grew up in the Caribbean, and coconut water doesn't taste like this."
0,"I have been drinking coconut water for a couple of years and I got my father drinking it by going on the Subscribe & Save program and shipping this to him. I finally cancelled it because at least 2 of the containers would be leaking, the box would be soaked, and it's not such a great price if you're only getting 4 boxes out of it. It's crazy and I have received no response from Amazon or Vita Coco regarding my complaints. I am a loyal Amazon customer and that will not change, but I will never order Vita Coco to be shipped again."
0,"I usually never write a review but I feel compelled to do it this time. THe packaging is very poor. The coconut water color are dark, almost black. It is crazy that they are selling spoilt food products and get away with it."
0,"Coconut water was somewhat sour tasting, probably due to the fact that the expiration date was very close. I will cancel the subscription and continue to buy this product in a supermarket."
1,"Too much packaging, great product - almost half off what I pay for this in NYC. Arrived promptly.  More words to fill the 20-word quota."
1,Its the best and most natural form of coconut water that we can get in a tetra pack. and its cheaper than buying a tender coconut and going through the hassle of cracking it.
0,"I purchased a pack of 6 boxes of 33.8 ounce Vita Coco coconut water.  The package arrived fine.  I put 3 boxes in my refrigerator.  Boy, did they make a mess!  All 3 started leaking overnight.  My wife was not happy at all. I transferred the leaking packs to soda bottles.  I don't want to try putting the remaining 3 packs in the refrigerator and will transfer to soda bottles as well.  I wish I could get a refund, but there is no way to return now, and no easy way to contact the vendor.  This turned out to be a real pain!"
1,"Hands down the best coconut water I've ever had.  I've already ordered about 5 cases of these things and will order more when I run out.  The only downside I've experienced with it is the packaging.  My 2nd and 3rd order came in and apparently some of the cartons were punctured, which give off a terrible smell in the package.  I contacted amazon about the problem and they immediately refund my order.  I received my most recent order today and was pleasantly surprised to see all of the bubble wrap around the product.  Each carton was perfectly protected and I'm very happy with my purchase.  I guess they've received enough complaints about the shoddy packaging to finally fix it.  This price is unbeatable btw."
1,"Ive been drinking coconut water my whole life and seriously LOVE the stuff.  When I first found VitaCoco all i could think was these guys are geniuses and somehow managed to create a coconut drink that actually tastes like the real coconut.  When I saw amazon was selling the product in boxes of 6 i thought, ""Even better, its shipped right to my door."" That is until i received my second shipment and found a box full of sticky Vita Coco packages with two of the boxes open and half empty.  I decided it would be apt o return the boxes, but for whatever reason, that is not in the Amazon return policy.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Love the product, but the shipment packaging sucks and Amazon wont allow you to receive credit or return the broken boxes."
1,I love it because it is the most natural coconut water i've ever tasted. I have tried many different products but this one is really pure coconut water.  no additives or sugar...........i so love coconut water.
1,"Something is definitely wrong with vita coco's boxes. Two of them leaked enough to soak the cardboard boxes they came in. I checked and it appears to be something wrong with their peal back seals rather than the boxes themselves and I will be calling the company so they can address their faulty packaging since it's not Amazon. The drink itself is better than a few that I've tried thus far. I mix them with protein powder after the gym or sip them on their own. Very tasty. Better than Zico which tasted strange to me.<br /><br />If you order it and get a pack that leaks, call the company and complain. They need to know from anyone who has a leaking product that their product is faulty. It's not amazon as the foil seal on the boxes wasn't secure. In fact, I'll be raising issues of product tampering as a safety issue.<br /><br />The drink itself is great. The packaging not so much."
1,"Afer purchasing this product at a store, I could not find it again.  I tried Whole Foods, World Market, and a couple of specialty stores.  It was great ordering on Amazon.  This water is awesome for steaming rice.  It delivers sweetness without too much coconut flavor."
1,"When I was little and in Vietnam, I used to taste coconut juice every time I went to the country-side to visit my grandparents.  This brings back that memory.  I really like it.  It's not too sweet, and I can definitely taste a salty element of the juice.  However, it's a balanced taste.  At first, when you take a sip, it might taste a little sour or as if it has gone bad.  However, the more you drink it, the better it gets. One warning though:  it's a natural laxative.  So, be very careful where you are drinking for the very first time.  Let your body have a reacation to it first before bringing to sport events, work, etc.  It's better when chilled.  Enjoy :)"
1,"Vita Coco Coconut Water has become a vital part of my day. A few months ago, I read that Vita Coco has 15 times more electrolytes than any sports drink on the market. However, I do not consider this drink just a sports drink. For example I have swapped my morning coffee with a 100% pure Vita Coco. Unlike drinking coffee and than crashing, Vita Coco makes me feel energized throughout the day! Whenever I make breakfast smoothies, I always use Vita Coco. Below is a great recipe to try!<br /><br />3 cups frozen strawberries<br />1 banana (or 1 cup of blueberries)<br />1 cup Vita Coco (I use 100% pure)<br />1 cup of icecubes (optional)<br /><br />Place all ingredients in a blender and puree well. Add more Vita Coco if needed for smoothier consistency. Too easy, too good!<br /><br />I swear by this drink. I used to get cramping in my muscles and shin splints after running...but when I drink this before and after my run, I do not feel any pain....<br /><br />Simply put when I drink Vita Coco, I feel more refreshed and healthier. So thanks for making such a great product!"
1,Delicious and transaction was quick and professional.Drinking this product definitely made you feel good about what you were taking into your body and was truly yummy.
1,"I love my Vita Coconut water! It is wonderful! I use it in my smoothies and in other recipes everyday. Great stuff! When you live too far from a grocery store to get fresh coconuts, this is the best alternative."
1,"I signed up for the subscription hoping the bad reviews were just flukes on the shipping.  The taste is great as always, but one of my boxes was damaged in shipping and leaked all over my laundry room.  I should have contacted the retailer to get it replaced but I just mopped up the mess and made a mental note to cancel my subscription and order a smaller size.  I do wish they would address the shipping/packing problem as it has been mentioned more than once on this site.  Whomever is making the executive decisions for their packing and shipping needs to come up with a better plan or more customers will go elsewhere!"
1,"If you like coconut water, this is for you! I had bought this product at a local market to try, while having chemo. Turns out the more i drank, the more i wanted! It has potassium in it, and some chemo makes you potassium deficient. So, i felt better drinking this product,along with lots of water, to say hydrated."
1,"It's summertime, with lots of days over 100 degrees F. in Central California. Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water comes to the rescue! It's the most refreshing drink I have ever had, and the added Vitamin C takes care of that nutritional requirement at the same time. Also, Vita Coco tastes much better than other coconut waters I have tried."
1,"Amid all the horror stories and bad experiences with this product that several other people have unfortunately had, I would like to write my own review. Vita Coco is my favorite brand of coconut water and I have been drinking it for a couple years now, and I recently decided to try ordering by the case here at Amazon instead of hunting down the odd carton or two at stores across my city (it's not that easy to find in San Antonio!) like I had been doing before. I was weary of giving Amazon a shot because of the other reviews with people's negative experiences, but luckily and thankfully I experienced none of those shipping and/or quality control issues with the water! My box of 6 1L Vita Coco's arrived promptly, was well packaged and the water itself was well within a reasonable expiration date (April 2013)! I couldn't be happier and look forward to getting my cases of VC shipped to me on a regular monthly basis with Subscribe & Save now! Hooray!"
1,"I've tried many brands and this is one of my favorites. The cheapest I've seen this in stores is at WaWa (NE gas station, rep!) and it's $2.50 for a 17fl oz box."
0,"Taste was good but CocoLibre is superior.  I am giving the product only 2 stars because of 6 cartons, one of them was unusable because it was leaking from the bottom and we don't know if it was contaminated."
0,This is the only time I will order this.  I like coconut and I like water but this stuff is nasty.  Maybe I got a bad batch or something but I won't make that mistake twice.
1,"First of all I LOVE VitaCoco Coconut water!! So ordering it was a no brainer for me. I had read several reviews that some people had issues with leaking containers when they received their shipment. It appears that Amazon or VitaCoco has taken steps to remedy this problem. I ordered the 6 - 33.8oz containers. They came packaged snug in a box that fit them perfectly. And that box was then wrapped in bubble wrap and put inside another box! No leaking! I am sooo happy with my order. I hope this review will help others with the decision on ordering this product. Based on some of the reviews that I had read, I almost didn't order from online. Hope this helps =)"
1,"I use it in my organic juices as a base sometimes lots of k and sweet, but low in cals, if you have not tried coco water, please do"
1,"I didn't buy this from amazon, but it doesn't really matter. So, delicious drink! buy it. very nutritious. the second it enters your mouth you forget youre not drinking from a real coconut. there's only two ingredients : coconut water, vitamin C. its a great buy and tastes delicious. non fat. healthy. NO STRAWS.......... there's supposed to be a straw.. i don't know what happened but apparently there's no straw . i bought it at costco......."
1,"I had a friend turn me on to coconut water for running because of the high amounts of potassium it has. It also has no added sugar and is a great alternative to gatorade. I think it tastes great cold and I like the convienince and packaging of the 1 quart boxes. I hope they continue to use the boxes instead of plastic because it biodegrades a little easier. Amazon had a great deal on a 6 pack of these, and you can't get them cheaper anywhere else. I paid about $1.70 for an 8 oz box in a grocery store. This was $3-4 for 4 times the amount."
1,"I don't know about the energizing levels but this tastes great and provides great health benefits! You really feel the difference when you come in from the heat during summer and have this! very thirst quenching compared to water which isn't enough usually. wish they would give more deals, discounts and promo codes! I do love this so but the price prevents me from buying it more often."
1,I found this product to be a great alternative to sport drinks. It is loaded with potassium but does not have the salt and sugar found in traditional sport drinks. The flavor is a little bland by itself so I add a little unsweetened fruit juice and it really fits the bill. Highly recommended!
1,"I am a brazilian living in the US and drank VitaCoco in Brazil for many, many years. Out of all the coconut waters I have tried, VitaCoco is the one that is the freshest of all, it can't be beat.<br />I saw a few other reviews that the customer had problems with the shipping (leaking boxes), but I haven't had any problems so far, with 2 shipments of these liter packages. I have a third on the way, I am hoping for a hat trick."
1,It tastes really nice. No preservatives or artificial ingredients. 100% coconut water. Not too sweet n not sour like other brands. I am use to drinking coconut water from a coconut n this is the closest on taste I have ever found.
1,"Very tasty stuff!!! I heard all about how this is the greatest drink ever, although 99% of what I heard I believe is hype I'm sure some of the claims have their root in fact.  It really did help me get over some pretty nasty hangovers."
1,"Great product but I must agree with other reviewers about packaging - ordered two cases. One was fine. The other one had one of the corners of one of six cartons frayed and about half a cup of cocowater made the packaging damp. Not sure how it gets frayed as it was packaged inside two other boxes... Great product, bad packaging.<br /><br />Looks like Amazon is doing something about it since the item is under review. Kudos to them!"
1,"This is as close to the 'Real McCoy' in Coconut Water as one will get.  It's really like ""Sticking a straw in a Coconut"".  A-1."
1,"Amazon does not always carry this 34-ounce container of Vita Coca Coconut Water (comes in package of 6). Wait, however, and it pops up on occasion.<br /><br />I think this is the best, sweetest tasting coconut water around. Even the Vita Coco in the smaller containers do not match the taste of the 34-ounce package. I have no idea why this would be the case, but after months of comparing it is simply, to my taste buds, true.<br /><br />The Amazon price is comparable to the prices I find at our local grocery store. Note that if Amazon does not have it in stock, private sellers do, and they always charge a lot more (plus shipping!)."
1,"Growing up in South-Asia, I drank coconut water almost everyday from real coconuts. This product comes just as close to the real thing as possible. Great taste, quenches your thirst, I always take one with me when playing sports, way better than some sports drink, at least in my opinion."
1,"I have tried other brands of coconut water and have found Vita Coco to be the best.  I drink it after a long run or on hot days just to stay hydrated.  And as always, I found it for a great price on Amazon."
1,"When they say it is like putting a straw in a<br />coconut they are telling the truth..Clean, clear,<br />crisp taste..<br /><br />I travel from Michigan to the Caribbean with<br />one sip...<br /><br />Sit back and enjoy....."
1,"This coconut water is the best drink I have ever had.  I'm not much for drinking water, and this is a good alternative to keeping hydrated.  I have also found that coconut water helps greatly with digestion and regulating your system much like activia claims to do.  If  you suffer from stomach ailmants this will help to get you back on track if you drink it regularly."
1,"i bought this from a local store after trying various other brands (zico, harvest bay and 2-3 others that I can't remember).<br /><br />Hands down, this one is the best.  the other brands had a much more mild coconut flavor, and none of the sweetness you get from fresh coconut water.  vitacoco is there on all fronts.<br /><br />now, I won't say it tastes exactly the same as fresh coconut water, but in a pinch, it's definitely the best brand I've found.<br /><br />also, just as a price hint, look for it at your local stores.  I'm in Seattle and found it at Fred Meyer on sale: $3 for 34oz box...half the price of amazon.  unfortunately, fred meyer only had 1 box left.  :("
1,"I used to live in Hawaii and really missed fresh coconut water.  The water from supermarket coconuts are hit and miss.  I have tried Zico, ONE and Vita Coco, and although they are all good, I find Vita to be the best tasting.  The only complaint I have is that it is a little pricey, but it is worth it for something so tasty and healthy.<br /><br />Just one more note, you sometimes see coconut water in cans.  That stuff usually has fillers and added sugar.  Always read the labels before buying because there is a lot of junk out there."
1,Its taste is very similar to that of fresh natural coconut water. I love it!<br />Purchasing Vita Coco from this vendor and website was easy and hassle free.
1,Great real coconut young coconut taste. Not the usual overwhelming sweet taste seen on other coconut water canned drinks.  Good on the environment. Made in Brazil. Even better.
1,"I love this stuff. It truly is the best and does what it says - hydrates every cell in your body, and revitalizes,as well.I can feel the difference when I drink plain water for thirst, and then this. Vita Coco and O.N.E. Coconut water are without a doubt the best thirst-quenchers and energy boosters out there."
1,"If you ever had a fresh coconut, you know how rare the water is in each coconut.  There just isn't enough juice in a fresh whole coconut to fully quench a thirst.  Well Vita Coco just did all the work for you.  Each carton is 100% pure coconut water.  This stuff taste fantastic cold and you can just gulp an entire 11 oz pack in like 5 seconds.  People say it is provides better hydration that sports drinks and a ton of other scientific stuff about it, but in the end, I just bought it cause I like the taste of coconut water and this is pure 100% coco water.  Get it both for taste and it's health benefits."
1,I love this stuff. Very thirst quenching and<br />re-hydrating. I wish it were less expensive.
0,My local Food Emporium at UWS carries this product for $4.19 per 34oz pack so this is way too expensive at Amazon for $5.50 per pack.
1,"Bought this as a gift for my friend Zoey in Florida.  She absolutely loves cocowawa, and Vita Coco is among the 2 brands she enjoys the most. Keeps her in top condition whether replenishing after running 5k, or preparing for Clinky Drinky Friday nights.  Rare is the time you will find Zoey without a refreshing cocowawa close at hand. If it's good enough for Zoey, its good enough for any goddess, god, or mere mortal."
1,"vita coco tastes almost like plucking coconuts from tree and drinking fresh. if you have never experienced coconut water before, certainly drink it very chilled.<br />i found this 34oz resealable package to be ideal for my family (my husband and daughters are addicted to vita coco). 34 oz feeds them for 2 days (if that) and is less waste than having to throw out several of the smaller 11 oz sizes.<br />next purchase will be the 17oz size."
0,this product tasted rancid it seem like a lower in product was able to camouflage with Hawaiian Punch and lots of ice. I do not believe I'll ever ordered again was very disappointed. Expected better quality for the price found it Fred Meyers cheaper and fresher.
0,"I've had many other coconut waters, all of which had added flavor.  But this one I can't choke down....I like the others I've had, I really don't like this one!"
0,I LOVE coconut water.  I drink it every day.  This is the worst kind.  It just doesn't taste right at all.  Amy and Brians or ONE are much better.  Even the cheap Tasco brand is better than this.  Do not buy this... please Amazon start carrying Amy and Brians or try to keep ONE in stock.  They keep putting this on sale because its NOT GOOD!
1,"This pesto is certainly edible. I like it, but it does not make the meal an eating experience like some other pestos. We bought it to save some money, but we went back to the more expensive brand afterward."
1,"If my dog could review this product, she'd give it 5 stars. She obviously loves the bacon flavor and being a very licky puppy, this is a real treat for her. As the pet owner, I like that she seems so content with the product, but it's a non-traditional way of delivering a treat and seems a bit awkward. The treat is given through a roll-on ball, like the old deodorants. With little treat bites, you can reward a dog with one or two nibbles, but regulating the number of licks or the time they're allowed to lick doesn't work so well. For training purposes, I wouldn't recommend this product, but just for gratuitous treat giving, I think it's just fine."
0,"I tried this product on my dogs 3 times and each time, they would not touch it!  Admittedly, my dogs are picky, but no even one of them would try it.  They would walk up and sniff it, but they would not even taste it.  My dogs (3) are all small dogs and don't eat a lot of food.  Maybe if your dog is larger or less picky, it would appeal, but I can't say I would recommend this product."
1,"Our six dogs (four of our own, plus two foster dogs) all LOVE getting their ""licks"" from this Bacon Flavor Lickety Stik!!!  They are all medium to big dogs (Boxer mixes, Pit Bull mix, Black Lab mix , Plott Hound & Greyhound mix) and they all come a-runnin' when I pull the bottle out.  Even Mollie, our finicky-eater Black Lab mix, loves it.  Sometimes, they try to take a bite, but they all quickly figure out that the trick is to lick the little roll-on-deodorant-type ball.  The key, of course, is to hold the bottle while the dogs help themselves, as opposed to giving them the bottle to do with what they please...  ;o)<br /><br />The bottom line is the Bacon Flavored Lickety Stik gets a unanimous ""Four Paws Up"" from my test panel!  Highly recommended!"
1,"I have to say this is an unusual product.  It's made on the same order as a deodorant and the dog licks the roller to get the flavoring.  We got the liver flavor and all the dogs loved it.  In fact, there was some times when two dogs were trying to lick the roller at the same time since they can't seem to wait their turn.  It's definitely something to try...don't know how well it would do training your dog instead of the regular treats, though.  It'll probably get gross after a few lickings too but a damp paper towel should fix it up...especially if you wipe it after the dog uses it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't comment if it really tastes like liver flavor.  The dog's aren't talking but they definitely seem to like it...<br /><br />Oh yeah, and its made in the USA!"
1,"Well, the title says it all.  The little dogs of the household loved this interesting twist on the traditional treat.  They did not seem to understand why they were not allowed to walk off with it, but they grasped the concept eventually.  Often traveling with our two smallest poms, this ""roll-on"" style treat is a simple, non messy, non-poop-inducing alternative to traditional treats.  It is ""just enough"" when you want to reward them without having to worry about making a mess in the car.  I am not sure if this concept will catch on with the mainstream, but as long as it is competitively priced, I can see this being a useful tool for many dog-rearing activities.  While we are far past that stage, I can see this being helpful for different training activities as well.  Bring yourself and your dog ""outside of the bubble"" and give this new treat a try."
1,"Can you imagine how this product came to fruition?  It seems like an accident.  Like the guys in R&D accidentally filled some roll-on deodorant tubes with dog food flavoring.  Or maybe it was a large-scale Big Lots-style buy where the guys at the pet food factory got an incredibly great deal when a Ban roll-on factory got flooded and had to unload a warehouse.<br /><br />In any event, what seems like a really weird idea is...well, a really weird idea that our dog LOVES.  Of course there's not much nutritional value to letting your dog take a few slurps off the end of a liver-flavored roll-on doggie treat, but hey, there's not much nutritional value to that rawhide toy you just bought him either.  Give this a try for dessert."
1,When I first saw this I wasn't to sure but I love to give my pups new things to try. When it came in I checked it out....it looks like a roll on deodorant. I had to laugh but then came the taste test. I think my dogs are in love with this! We have small dogs...all less than 6lbs and I have to roll the ball for them to get more flavor so it's not so bad but I imagine that larger dogs can roll the ball themselves. If you're looking for something new and different then you may want to give this one a try!
1,"Nina, Sam(antha) and Grizzly are ""licking it up.""  The feature that appeals to me most is that the calorie count is so low per ""taste.""  It's a real snack alternative that many of us with pets should consider!<br /><br />Great idea!<br /><br />I rate ""PetSafe Lickety Stik 1.6-Fluid Ounce, Bacon Flavor""...Five stars!<br /><br />P.S., As many pet snacks are notoriously high in fat, I truly recommend this as a low-calorie alternative!<br /><br />P.P.S., Maybe they should come up with on for us humans?  Just a thought!"
1,"I ordered this, not sure if my dogs would like the roller ball or turn their noses up at it, but I'm happy to report they loved it! They went at it with gusto-so much so that I had to put it away after only a few licks-afraid they might make themselves sick. Little did I know that my little monsters would find a way to knock it off the shelf & absolutely destroy the bottle while I was at the grocery store. I came home to a shredded bottle & 2 pomeranians with very guilty looks on their faces.....<br />I think this is a great product & if the reaction of my dogs is any indication-so do they. I will definitely be ordering more when it becomes available, but might have to invest in a lock box to keep it in....lol!"
1,"I have the most picky dog in the world.  She's a big dog, which usually means they'll eat anything, but not my dog, so when I got her the Likety Stik, I honestly didn't think she'd like it, but she loved it!  And what a great training tool.  Rather than fill your pocket with treats,(that usually go through the wash) you have a neat, no fuss way to reward them.<br /><br />I did have to squeeze it to get the liquid moving along after she'd licked it, and it dripped onto her pure white, newly bathed ruff, but it came off with just water, so no worries.<br /><br />I then took the Stik over to my in-laws to give to their obese King Charles spaniel, and he of course loved it, because he eats anything.  What they liked was being able to give him treats that didn't add to his weight problem.<br /><br />Lickety Stik is a great new way of treating your dog.  Whoever came up with it is a genius.  I'm going to buy every flavor for my dog, and one for my in-laws dog."
1,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:16 Mins<br /><br /></span>Joy-Joy likes these strange little treats.  They remind me of roll-on deodorant.  They have a very strong smell."
0,"The roller ball on this treat (basically gravy) does not roll around readily from the friction of my dog's tongue licking. The only way to get gravy out of the bottle to where the dog can get it is by squeezing the bottle to force the gravy out around the edges and letting the dog lick the gravy off the surface (kind of defeats the purpose of bothering with the roller ball). I let my dog lick this treat for two sessions, but when I went back the third, the roller jammed so no matter how hard I squeezed, none of the gravy inside was coming out. I stood the bottle upright and pushed down on the ball to try to loosen it from the bottle top edge and let more flow through. This seemed to get the flow going again for 2-3 rough squeezes, but it shortly jammed again. I can still move the roller ball around with my fingers, and there will be a little gravy stuck to the part of the ball I move into the open, but it's not working as it was the first two times. There is still 2-3 tablespoons of product left in the bottle. Sorry, but I'm not going to sit there and manually roll the ball around with my fingers or forever tinker with pushing down on the ball so my dog can lick a miniscule amount of gravy at a time. I've checked for anything blocking the area between the bottle end and roller ball, but haven't seen anything likely to stop the flow or rolling (no dried clumps, etc). The convenience is lost if the gravy doesn't come out by itself from squeezing the bottle and the roller ball can't roll with the dog's tongue alone.<br /><br />I would recommend not using this over any carpet or floor surfaces you don't want to risk getting stained since there will likely be dripping. The gravy (when it did come out from squeezing the bottle) comes out from all sides of the ball at once instead of from one point where the dog can focus, so depending on which side your dog likes to lick, it might not catch the gravy from the side that isn't being licked right away in time to catch the gravy before it falls to the floor.<br /><br />The taste seems to be rated middle to low by my dog. My dog loves bacon flavored treats (can't get enough Beggin' Strips) and ate this product up readily enough in the beginning when it was new, but it's since become clear he isn't crazy about it. Now he's seen what this gravy is about, he might take one or two licks then walk away. I have to keep calling him back to encourage him to finish up and take another lick. I don't think I would be able to get him to finish the bottle even if it were flowing properly.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would bother buying more of these unless I was assured of the reliability of the bottle not jamming again and the roller working properly. I would love to see some sort of refillable roller bottle offered so I could fill it with some cheap homemade gravy instead (there is no way to refill these bottles yourself) since I do like the concept of limiting how much gravy he's able to get at at a time via this roller mechanism."
1,"My little diabetic shih-tzu, Lily, is notorious for hating anything new. I am constantly on the search for healthy new treats that I can give her after she has her insulin shot (every 12 hours...ugh!) I received the Liver flavor Lickety Stik and was prepared to donate it to the local animal shelter because I was just sure Lily would turn up her nose to it. Lo and behold...she liked it! It took a minute or two for her to figure out how to get the treat out and I squeezed the bottle too hard and some dripped on the floor, but Lily quickly lapped it up. I don't think the ball turned very easily, but she was determined to try to get the treat-juice out of the bottle. I think this is a great idea, but I am only giving it 4 stars because the packaging was hard to read and the ball didn't seem to turn very readily."
0,"The smell and taste of the Lickety Stik was an instant success with our dog.<br />But the dispensing ball dosen't move easily, very much of the time,<br />and it's a nuisance for us to keep helping the ball turn for our dog to get this treat.<br />We get more on our hands then our Golden gets in his mouth.<br />When we try to turn the ball for our dog, even we find it difficult.<br /><br />The roller BALL is a concern, we don't consider it 'pet safe'.<br />If our Golden Retriver got this bottle,<br />he could easily bite this roller ball out and would try to eat it.<br /><br />The ball requires a strong tounge to move it, even at that it gets stuck.<br />We can't imagine this stik being at all compatible with small dogs.<br />If you squeeze the bottle to force the liquid out around the ball<br />most of that drops to the ground between licks.<br /><br />This would be a great idea if it worked, and was truely 'pet safe'."
1,"I have one dog, Rex, a Shepherd/Lab mix and he absolutely loves the Lickety Stik. Now if he sees me get it out, he automatically sits or gives me his paw. So cute.<br /><br />This is a great new idea for doggy treats. Especially when walking my dog- I've gotten tired of carrying a bag of treats for him. And new ideas are always welcome, I don't want to overfeed my dog with other treats... They can get expensive because he's allergic to almost everything.<br /><br />So the lickety sticks come in three flavors- liver, chicken and bacon. Rex loved each one. The container that holds the liquid treat is a roller... I saw another reviewer describe it like a deodorant stick with a roller. That is exactly what the case is like. Unfortunately the liquid doesn't just come out when the ball is licked, the bottle has to be squeezed for your dog. My roller gets stuck if I don't squeeze or push it with my finger.<br /><br />I highly suggest trying this item out, great alternative to milk bones :)"
1,"Really like the idea of a roller-ball to give treats, especially as rewards when training (skateboard, leash walking and close commands).  The dispenser is similar to a roll-on deodorant design.  Lickety Stik is a healthy all natural (according to the ads) liquid containing vitamins and low in calories in several flavors. The dispenser contains over 500 licks.  A no mess way to give rewards plus it carries the made in the USA with all-natural ingredients.  My English Bulldog puppy loves the stuff (liver flavor); however, it also comes in chicken and bacon flavors. Following  is a list for those who read the ingredients,  1)natural liver flavors, (2) cultured milk, (3) lecithin, (4) mixed tocopherols (natural preservative- a source of vitamin E), (5) scorbyl palmitate (source of vitamin C), (6) rosemary extract, (7) green tea extract.  A caution about dogs allergic to chicken - they should not be licking this stuff. Unlike most treats, the shelf life is 18 months and ""best"" licked by date is stamped on the bottom of the roll-on dispenser. The description indicates the Lickety Stik formula contains antimicrobial agents - basically no germ transfer. The stuff does not have to be refrigerated.  Naturally, you must shake the dispenser often.  Will be ordering the Lickety Stik 3 pack with all flavors from Amazon.  ""Reilly"" recommends the treat!"
1,"I had to give the ball a partial turn to get some of the liquid on it after shaking to mix it up, but after I did that my dog licked away and loved it! This is a good low-cal treat for dogs and would be great as a training aid. Our dog dutifully performed her repertoire of tricks to get more of the treat, and then followed me back to the kitchen as I put it away. The only bad thing is that you DO have to hold it for the dog, but if you're using it as a training aid that may actually be an advantage.<br /><br />There are over 500 licks in each tube and 10 licks is only 1 calorie. I gave my dog 10 licks per trick.<br /><br />FWIW, my dog is a 1.5 year old hound dog/bird dog mutt."
0,"The Lickety Stick is truly a unique product. It's basically a rollerball bottle (like some deodorants) with different flavored syrups (like chicken, beef, or bacon). I've never seen anything like it. The promo video says dogs love the taste and it's very low cal (oddly, the video also warns of an epidemic of pet obesity, which while probably is true, I had never heard it described in such catastrophic and somber tones). The treat is on the high price end of what dog treats usaully cost, but the maker boasts each bottle contains over 500 licks. I've been trying to figure out if that's a good deal. Normal-sized treat bags don't usually have 500 treats, but on the other hand, you would never just give your dog 1 lick off this thing.<br /><br />If your dog likes the Lickety Stick (there are review testimonies here going both ways), then it's left up to you how long puppy gets to lick, so the touted cost-effectiveness could quickly evaporate (there is no recommended serving size on the bottle). All in all, the Lickety Stick reminds me of a sugar free lollipop. They can have a decent flavor, but not everyone will like them; they don't have calories, so they're ""healthier;"" and because they're calorie free, they don't fill you up at all, which leaves me with a final thought.<br /><br />Regular dog treats do at least have a substance factor; they are a solid food. The Lickety Stick is a calorie free liquid, so the filling factor is missing. And so while Charlie did enjoy the Lickety Stick, she probably won't be getting another one. She is already in great physical condition, eats an organic dog food regimented according to the bag-recommended diet, and is taking C9 vitamin supplements. Basically, she gets enough health stuff is what I'm saying; so when she does get a treat, I want her to enjoy it like the treat that it is. I'm not convinced the Lickety Stick does that. Now, if you are trying to wean your pet off table food or lower their weight, this product could probably help you do that."
1,"Well, it must taste good, 'cause my dog just loves it.  It did take a minute to teach him to lick it instead of just trying to grap it out of my hand."
1,"PetSafe Lickety Stik is a weird looking dispenser full of a delicious liquid treat my pooches are crazy about.  The strange design is slightly bigger than a deoderant bottle and the dogs get their treat by licking the roll-on ball!<br /><br />I own Wonderland Kennels, with 7 Boston Terriers and German Shepherds that I train and compete with.  Even the picky ones love this stuff.  The bottle is small, but it goes a loooong way because the pups are only getting a little at a time, instead of a larger treat.<br /><br />Pacino and Molly (German Shepherds) first instincts were to try to bite down on the dispenser, but it didn't crack and is still holding up fine.  They quickly learned to just lick it, though the best way to introduce it to larger dogs is to hold it completely upside-down so the angle makes it easier to lick and harder for them to grab.<br /><br />I'm honestly surprised by how big a hit this little Lickety Stik is with my pups, and how long the bottle lasts.  Maizy, Molly, Gracie, Pixi, Einstein, Pacino, and Isabelle each give it four paws up!  :)"
1,"When I received this ""Lickety Stik"", I really wasn't sure what to expect with my dog.  Turns out I had nothing to worry about - he is CRAZY about it.  If I even go near the bottle he starts wagging his tail and giving me the excited look.  One aspect about this doohickey I really like is that you can use it as a reward for your pet, without constantly having to give him a biscuit or similar treat; just a lick off the Lickety Stik will do the trick!  The occasional biscuit and treat is okay, but this is much better for active training.  Highly recommend, though you may want to shy away from trying it yourself."
1,"My two Min Pins, who are constantly begging for treats, and then turning their noses up as most of what is offered to them, absolutely love this product.  They actually sat in front of me and took turns licking from the container.  It was hysterical; like two hamsters drinking water.  I will but this product again!"
1,"I wasn't sure if my dogs would be able figure out what to do with this, but they got it right away.  They loved the taste and would have kept licking it as long as I let them. The container is 5"" tall and approx. 1 1/2"" around and easily fit right in my jeans pocket, so this would be very easy to take on a walk. I could also see that this might be helpful if you happen to have a dog who won't eat - you could roll the liquid around the edge of his bowl and it may entice him to eat."
1,As soon as I got this in the mail I opened up this product.  My dogs absolutely loved it. In fact they tried after licking it to pull it out of my hand. This will be very convenient for my agility lessons and shows with my dogs.  Great product!!!
1,"with the exception of my senior chihuahua that viewed the container of Lickety Stik as possibly a lethal weapon and, not wishing to take any chances, tore out of the room when she saw it for under-the-bed protection.<br /><br />""Oh well,"" I said, ""I've got three other dogs.  Let's try them.""  At first my toy bichon-poodle was also wary and stepped back.  But when she saw my shepherd and chow chow growing very excited and thrilled by this new offering, she relented and tasted some herself.  It was a decided hit.<br /><br />There are no directions on the small plastic container as to how to use, so I was uncertain if I should squeeze it and, if so, how tightly.  I quickly learned that squeezing it too firmly causes the liquid to pour out so, if squeezed, ""lightly"" should be the watchword.  I would advise the first time trying it to place a paper towel under the container until one gets the hang of manipulating the small plastic bottle and administering the treat to the dog(s), which will not be a problem as my two large dogs, and eventually the smaller one, just kept wanting to lick and lick and keep on licking.  They found this new-found gadget to be very exciting.<br /><br />What is most appealing about it to me is that it contains all natural ingredients - nothing artificial.  They consist of natural flavors, cultured milk, lecithin, rosemary extract and green tea extract.  It also contains Vitamin A.<br /><br />So this is a fun way to make your dog(s) happy, small enough to carry in your pocket, light enough for easy carrying.  Now I've only used it once, but I predict that the next time my dogs (chihuahua excepted) see me holding the by now familiar container, there'll be a stampede of sorts.  Just like in television commercials.<br /><br />Tail waggin' good!"
0,"Do you know those Tootsie Pop commercials where they'd see how many times the Tootsie Pop could be licked before they'd chew right into it?  That's how this Likety Stik worked with my dog.  He licked it three or four times, then immediately wanted to chew on the roller.  I repeatedly pulled it out each time he'd try, but it kept repeating.  Lick, lick, lick, chew.  Lick, lick, lick chew.  Within one minute, no exaggerating, he had chewed off the end and I was scared to death that he'd swallow the roll ball. Fortunately he spit it out, but if he had swallowed it, he easily could have choked to death on it with it blocking his windpipe.  I would never buy this product again, and highly recommend others not to.  Seriously, it was completely chewed through in one minute of opening the package."
0,My dog just didn't like the taste of them which surprised me since he likes food.  Tried each flavor same result.  I cannot recommend.
1,"This is a nice idea for a low calorie dog treat.<br /><br />It looks just like a roll-on antiperspirant, and you have to roll the ball to get it going. One problem is that this is a syrup or other liquid that is pretty sticky and I usually have to get the ball rolling myself each time. Also, once I offer it to my dogs they can get one lick but cannot get the ball moving.<br /><br />The other problem I've had is my dogs want to take the whole thing, not just lick the surface of it. They seem to like the taste because they really grab the whole thing.<br /><br />I think it's a fun idea and it does seem to taste great to them, though I wouldn't really recommend it because of the ball being hard for dogs to roll. (in my experience)"
0,"I have a 60lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix who loves all sorts of treats so I'm always on the lookout for new products. Unfortunately, many doggie treats have gotten a bit pricey these days if you plan on giving them a helping. When the PetSafe Lickety Stik (essentially the same design as a roll-on deodorant) popped up on Amazon Vine I naturally snatched one up right away. Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Low in calories, 1 per 10 licks.<br /><br />+ My dog loved them.<br /><br />+ Container has a re-sealable cap.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Fluid can drip out of roller ball and leave a sticky residue on surfaces.<br /><br />- Container is not really pet safe if the dog gets ahold of the treat.  Most dogs could easily chew apart the package and choke on the roller ball.<br /><br />- Doesn't promote healthy chewing, essential for a dog's teeth.<br /><br />- Small container is not good for bigger or messier dogs.  My dog licked not just the roller ball but the handle itself including my fingers.<br /><br />- Smells absolutely awful.<br /><br />My dog loved the Lickety Stik (although he's not terribly picky about treats) and the product allowed me to stop his treat giving at any time. Sadly, he doesn't get any dental benefit from ingesting this treat. Better suited for smaller dogs who won't slobber all over trying to lick out the fluid.  Still, I wouldn't pay the asking price for the item. The best thing about this treat was they occupied my dog long enough to groom him sufficiently."
1,"My family has two chihuahuas. I tried the dog treat on the two of them today and got different reactions. The largest chihuahua liked it and the smallest chihuahua did not. This is par to the course and people like different things too.<br /><br />The treat is a liquid that taste like liver. It can be rolled easily anywhere you desire. All you have to do is take the top off and squeeze the sides of container. It is easy to use. It certianly is a new concept as I have always thought of dog treats as something solid.<br /><br />I would recommend it for any dog owner. If you have any questions, ask at this email!"
0,"This is a pretty neat concept, rewarding your dog with licks rather than treats, to cut down calorie consumption.  However, it's only good if your dog likes it.  Mine doesn't.  To be fair, he's 8 years old and set in his ways."
0,"This item seems like a great idea...a convenient, and non-messy way to carry treats for the dog.  It is like a roll-on deodorant container...a bottle of fluid with a rolling ball top that brings the fluid up to the top of the ball as it is spun.  It has a rich, bacon smell smell to it and my little dog (7 lb. Maltese) was interested in it, but I couldn't get him to lick it beyond the first tentative taste.  I think that it was the novel delivery that threw him off, not the taste.  I believe that with a larger dog, where one tongue swipe would clear off and refresh the ball, it might be better received.<br /><br />I'm back after trying this with a larger dog with no success.  He just wanted to take the whole thing in his mouth.<br /><br />This seems like a good idea and it might work if you started using it with a puppy as a training device.  Perhaps you could ""train"" older dogs to use it properly, but it is certainly NOT worth the effort to do that."
0,"We have four smallish house type dogs that rule the roost here, so we thought we'd try this new bacon flavored Lickety Stik product on each of them. Reviews were mixed. A couple of them sniffed a lot, but didn't seem to want to partake. The other two licked gingerly, and would continue to do so as long as we squeezed the plastic bottle, but they didn't seem overly enthusiastic. It seemed to take a lot to squeeze the brown goo out onto the plastic head, actually, and it tended to drip off too much at times before they could lap it up. I think it also was bothersome that the plastic bottle looks a lot like a roller-ball underarm deodorant dispenser. Rather bizarre in a way. One of our sons is always teased about liking bacon so much, so at the latest family night supper he was asked if he wanted some Lickety Stick for his underarms. Everyone laughed. Except the dogs. They were trying to do a serious analysis and review. Anyway, maybe some dogs will like this stuff, but our family voted against buying more for our dogs. It was an interesting experiment, and your mileage may vary."
0,"I'm always willing to try something new for my dogs, and this sounded like a great idea, a portable no-mess treat delivery system.<br />The flavor I'm reviewing is ""Smoky Bacon""<br />I experienced some of the same issues noted by other reviewers. The ball in mine did not roll freely, so once my dog licked it clean, I had to manually advance it with my finger. So much for the ""no mess"" aspect.<br /> Squeezing the bottle as suggested by a few only results in a glop of foul-smelling liquid oozing out and dripping on the floor.<br />Yes, I said foul-smelling. I know dogs have a somewhat different take from their people on what smells good and what doesn't, but 3 of our 4 dogs recoiled at the smell of the product. Our only ""outside"" dog would take a lick, then take a sniff of her own rear end...presumably she found the scent similar. If you've ever seen a dog do that, then you know what I mean.<br /><br />I'm also concerned about how sanitary this delivery system is. Between uses you have a ball laden with dog-mouth bacteria multiplying. I doubt rinsing the ball before storage would help much, undoubtably some slobber is going to contaminate the bottle contents during usage. Refrigeration is not suggested on the label but it might help retard bacteria growth between uses.<br /><br />I think this product is another one of those things that sound like a good idea but the execution is flawed. I cannot recommend this product in good faith, and the $7.99 suggested retail price is a little steep for 1.7 fluid ounces of product."
0,"I tried this on three dogs, a border collie, a weiner dog, and a little taco dog. Each one showed an interest in only one of the three flavors, bacon being the top contender (two out of the three), as opposed to the chicken and liver flavors. However, the weiner dog (who has no other known allergies) was clearly allergic to this product -- she sneezed every time she licked it so I gave her no more. She has never sneezed like this before.<br /><br />In summary, with all the treats that are available for dogs these days, even though this one is a low-calorie type, I would pass it by. It seems like a good idea but in actuality, I'm pretty sure that you'll be seeing this product on the sale table at Big Lots before too long."
0,"I usually try to see the good side of things so I'll start with  - my dog liked the taste.  She is an older dog and it takes a lot to get her excited, this did.  As for me, it's messy, and kind of icky when you think about the dog's saliva being put into the bottle every time you roll the ball top.  The top is a roller ball that is very difficult to turn.  You get your fingers sticky with this strong smelling liquid, and it has to be done repeatedly. You can run it along the counter to turn it, also a bad idea. The dog just gets a taste from the ball, then wants to EAT the bottle which, according to the warning label, is a no no.  No eating the roller ball or the bottle!  If they were to get hold of the ball it could choke the dog.  Bad design if you ask me.  OF COURSE the dog is going to want to bite the bottle if it tastes like bacon juice.<br />  I gave her a couple licks and decided to throw the rest away.  Sorry puppy."
1,My dog loves this treat. She loves the taste of it and I like that it lasts a while. Other treats just do not last long with her including rawhides but with the Lickety Stik she gets approx 500 licks. She goes nuts every time I go to twist the top off of it and doesn't stop licking until I finally say that she's had enough. With any dog treat some dogs may not like it but I think it's worth a try to purchase Lickety Stik for your dog at least one time. I have found one problem with this treat which is the roller ball doesn't roll so well sometimes. It gets to one point where my dog licks it and it stops turning which annoys her and annoys me as well because I have to get my hands all messy trying to fix the roller. This is the only gripe I have with this treat but it is also why I deducted one star from the overall review.
1,"I'm not sure exactly what this product is meant to be used for.  I would think it would be great to take on walks for a quick reward.  Just whip it out of your pocket and give your dog a lick.  No where on the product did I see the shelf life or how to store it.  I'm assuming it does not need to be refrigerated.  It looks just like a roll-on deodorant bottle.  It's just liver flavored gravy in a deodorant bottle. It's dispensed when the dog licks the ball.  I got the liver flavor. I don't see this lasting very long.  It's a small bottle.  There is a little ""window"" at the bottom of the bottle so you can see when it's almost empty.<br /><br />I could see these being used for treats in training.  ""Chester"" says it's great!"
1,"I only have i bottle (bacon flavor), so I don't know if it is typical, but the ball does not roll easily.  My dogs can get the liquid treat, but only if I squeeze the tube a bit.  And they aren't small dogs with weak tongues.  They are a Border Collie and a Labrador Retriever.  They do enjoy the treat, thought the Border Collie is not overly enthusiastic.  The Lab is enthusiastic about anything edible, even remotely, edible.  A bit messy as it drips a little when I squeeze it, but then it's not meant to have to be squeezed.  I will check other reviews and if my hard-to-move roller ball is the exception, I will be ordering more of this handy, portable treat which is easy to keep mess-free in a pocket."
1,"Lickety Stik is an all-natural dog treat that comes in a deodorant-like container with a roller ball on top.  The idea is when your dog wants a treat, you give him a few licks of this lo-cal product instead of something more fattening.  Ten licks = 1 calorie.  I wasn't sure what to think about this product at first--great idea or somewhat odd?  My dogs made the decision for me:  they love it!  In fact, when I picked up the bottle to write this review, they both came running.<br /><br />I think Lickety Stik would be especially useful if your dog is on a diet, or when you're training and don't want to give too many high-calorie treats.  This is a winner at our house."
1,"Gracie (our miniature Dachshund) absolutely loves this ""lick stick"".  She comes running when she sees me get it out.  The only drawback is that when I put it back away, she looks  at me like I am the meanest person ever."
1,"I got this thinking my chubby lil dog might benifit from a treat that was tasty but didn't add extra lbs. She's very picky  and I wasn't sure she would take to the new style treat. She loved the Bacon flavor and the hands on attention she got while I held the bottle. Our other dogs loved the  treat as well, the only downside of the treat is that u have to hold the bottle and squeeze it gently for the dog. And one can't be.shared one dog always wants to be first."
0,"Maybe my doggie is just not smart enough for this product?? I'm not sure. It comes packaged like ""Tussy"" Deodorant from the old days. You roll it around and the flavor is on the ball and as your dog licks it, the flavor keeps returning. Ok, what did MY dog do? Try to take the whole bottle. No way was he going to just ""lick"" it... he wanted the container. I obviously couldn't give him the whole thing because he would chew it and the liquid would squirt all over. Very strange ""treat"". If your dog is used to taking treats from you and chewing them up, getting them to just lick might be a trick. Not for Gus."
1,"The dogs like the Lickety Stiks, no question about it.  After one brief attempt to just bite it, the 3-year-old settled in to licking, and the the 11-year-old understood the idea from the start (to be fair, they are both experienced with the concept of licking ice cream and the 'lick it!' reminder may have helped).  I am sure if the Stiks were left in reach, they would quickly chew into them and make a mess, so that's something of which to be careful. They did not drip when held upside down, which was pleasing.<br /><br />I am fortunate that neither of our dogs are overweight or have weight concerns; owners with chubby dogs expressed extensive enthusiasm when I asked them about the Stiks.  The younger dog is not a huge treat hound -- he can often 'take it or leave it,' and these proved no different.  I keep hoping to find the motivator that he just can't walk away from.  The Stiks didn't prove to be his Achilles heel but they are in excellent company in that regard -- both dogs clearly found them palatable and enjoyable.<br /><br />My primary use of treats is in training, and my main quibble with the Stiks is that it is hard to use them to lure... you know how you have a treat in your hand and you allow the dog to nose it but not take it while you lure them?  You can't really do that with these.  They also wouldn't be good when set on a target, as a chunk of bait is. Also, the licks of the rollerball take time, while a small, soft chunk of cheese or liver can be gulped down without any noticeable delay in the action.<br /><br />I found all three 'flavors' to be rather unpleasantly smelly -- I think the manufacturer could maybe dial back the scent and still have plenty of appeal to the dogs.  They were also kind of sticky and did leave a smear if one accidentally brushed the roller-ball dispenser across any surfaces while wielding it.  Our newest vehicle has terribly inappropriate light-colored upholstery (what were we thinking?) and the commercials for the Stiks that talk about keeping one in the car made me cringe -- I would not want these anywhere near light-colored textiles!<br /><br />I'm glad to have tried these but I don't know that I will make a point to purchase them in the future, especially at the current price point."
1,"The main thing I love about this product is that its so good for use during training.  It's so much easier to carry on walks than a bag full of chopped hot dogs or dog treats.  Plus licking has been shown to have a calming effect on dogs which could make this product helpful for reactive dogs.  I like that the ingredients are all natural and there are no ""iffy"" ingredients.  To top it off my picky raw fed dogs love this stuff.  I'm keeping it as a training treat only to keep it special for them.  I would definitely recommend this product and plan on buying lots more!<br /><br />ETA:  I would caution against using this with totally unruly dogs.  If you think your dog would rip it out of your hand and chew it up enough to dislodge the ball I would not use this product as the ball *could* be a choking hazard.  I have pit bulls and they could tear this container apart in 2 seconds flat but they are well trained so I know they wouldn't. I would also caution against leaving it laying around where an unsupervised dog could get at it for the same reason.  But I think the benefits to this product far outweigh the potential dangers as long as your careful about it."
1,"Very handy way of dispensing a reward. Very palatable and dog is eager to get the next lick. Keep's one's hands clean while dispensing the treat. It seems great for training, as it is quick and easy to access and use. Great new product!<br /><br />*Donn (the dog) loves it. :)"
1,"I recently got PetSafe Lickety Stik for my dog, and she loves it!  The product consists of a bottle filled with a flavored liquid, and whenever Tiny wants some all I have to do do is shake the bottle, remove the cap, and let her lick at the roller until she's satisfied.  There are times when she tries to bite the bottle, but I usually solve that by completely upending it so that she can't get her mouth around it.<br /><br />All in all, if you want a treat for your dog that's low on messiness as well as being something that they'll enjoy, then PetSafe Lickety Stik is a good one."
1,"The Bacon Flavor Lickety Stik is like crack cocaine for my dog Rocky. If I handed him the product, it would be gone--plastic and all--within 30 seconds. However, you aren't supposed to ""give"" your dog the Lickety Stick, which works like a roll-on deodorant, the human holds it while the dog licks it. If your dog reacts like Rocky, you'll get a big kick out of it. While the novelty won't wear off for Rocky, I have the distinct impression that I'll get bored with it after a while.<br /><br />On the other paw, Mr. Peabody seemed to enjoy it, but he wasn't as enthusiastic as Rocky. Could it be their difference in age? Mr. P. is six years old and Rocky is one. Rocky also eats everything, including light bulbs, styptic powder, and prescription eyewear, but not with as much vigor as he attacked his Lickety Stik.<br /><br />Our third dog, Charity, sniffed it, looked at me like I had serious issues, and turned away. She's seven. Based on Rocky's & Mr. P.'s enjoyment of the product, I give it five stars; but if Charity was an ""only dog,"" it would get none."
1,"I didn't really know what I was getting when I chose to receive this product, but I love getting my dog new things. I thought it was really funny when I opened it- it looked like a roller-style deodorant! But I tilted the product to get the juice by the roller-ball and let my dog lick it. She loved it and caught on very fast!<br /><br />If you're looking for a treat you can give to your dog and then walk away, this isn't the one. You have to hold it so that he/she can lick it; they cannot eat the plastic part. I think it's a great treat for training. It's easy to carry around and ""operate"" (uncap, tilt, hold in front of dog). I'm using it to teach my dog simple things...she's learning to stay right now, and so I tell her to sit, I walk away, and when I let her come to me, she gets a few licks. It works like a charm!<br /><br />Of course there's the chance that your dog may not like the flavor or might try to chew the bottle instead of licking it. If you're lucky enough to have a dog that likes it/licks it instead of chewing it, it's a great treat to add to the mix! It's something different and new!"
1,"The lickety stick is not a lollipop.  It is a roller that looks similar to roll on deodorant or shoe polish.  Inside is the flavored juice.  When the dog's tongue licks the roller, the juice coats it and the dog gets a taste.  I was sent the liver flavor.  One of my dogs loved it.  He was slow at first, but once the roller got coated with the flavored juice, he just went at it.  He even tried biting it. I had a hard time getting it away from him.  My other dog was afraid of it.  I think he thought it was medicine.<br />So this is an interesting way to give a dog a treat. Kind of fun to sit there and watch him lick it like a lollipop.  My only complaint is the smell was gross.  The bacon flavor would probably smell better."
0,"Pros: Very low-calorie; dogs love the stuff; good for them--nutritious, all-natural.<br /><br />Cons: Stinky; can be hard to get out; you have to stand there squeezing it the whole time (so giving a normal treat is far more convenient); messy. They inevitably drip all over, so you'd better use them over an easy-to-wipe floor, or outside.<br /><br />The way it usually works for me is:<br />*squeeze...squeeze...squeeze*<br />""Where is it?""<br />*liquid starts pouring out; lands on floor because it always comes out on the opposite side of the roller-ball from the dog*<br />With luck, the dogs don't step in it too much, and I can easily go over the area with a damp cloth after pointing out the spots for them to lick up.<br /><br />It's not as ""convenient"" as they'd have you believe. You don't just squeeze, let the dog lick the coated ball, and recap it. This is liquid, and it's going to make a mess and require cleanup. (To be fair, regular treats can leave behind crumbs, slimy goo, etc., as well.) You can travel with it, sure, but I would sure as heck NEVER use it inside my car. Your hands can obviously still contact the sticky end and require washing, and I never feel right screwing the cap back on without first rinsing and wiping off the sticky end. If you don't make a habit of doing this, I'm certain that eventually you'll wind up in a dripping, oozing, gooey predicament. This may be cleaner for your hands than pieces of something else that may be sticky, slimy, and/or odiferous, but it's hardly the neatest thing in the world.<br /><br />Also...""no delay in presenting?"" Hmm. There's typically more of a delay in waiting for the liquid to start dripping out, with the dog sniffing at it and waiting, than there is in fumbling with a treat bag in your pocket. Either way, they know what's coming to them, but speed is not really an advantage of this product.<br /><br />The very concept should make it excellent for training, especially, because that can run you through your allotted treats very quickly. Dogs really can lick as much of this stuff as they want at any given time...one lick is hardly ever enough, but always appreciated. I normally wind up squeezing every few seconds for about 30-45 seconds, maybe a minute or so. It makes a good diet snack because they get something very flavorful, less filling, and more healthful. However, it's so messy that you'd have to keep it somewhere nearby and out of reach during training, rather than inside your pocket.<br /><br />Of course, they put a positive spin on the necessity of standing there holding and squeezing the tube, saying that the administration of this treat provides a bonding time and reinforces to the dog the source of his/her treats. Well, okay. I can't call that untrue, although it is rather unnecessary for anyone whom has as strong a relationship with his/her dog(s) as I do with mine. And they are all definitely well aware of me as a provider (or slave, in the opinion of the dog with the catlike mindset.) You should see them make firm eye contact, then look back and forth from your face to the treat cabinet or room, pointing you in the desired direction! Don't get me wrong, though; it is usually pleasant to stay close to your pet, giving him/her continuous drops of scrumptious meat-flavored liquid as he/she focuses intently on that ball--instead of simply watching them snatch a traditional treat and devour it wherever they feel like at the moment.<br /><br />A marginal amount of bonding may occur while you hold onto this thing for a couple of minutes and the dog laps at the putrid-smelling goo, obviously mocking you for your deficient senses of smell and taste.<br /><br />I tried out the three-pack of liver, chicken, and bacon for my three dogs as stocking stuffers this past Christmas, and we've still got a little bit of bacon and liver left. They obviously last a decent amount of time. I wouldn't be averse to buying them again if I saw them at a fair price in a store, and was looking for a small-portion, different type of dog treat.<br /><br />I haven't used them yet as a ""distraction"" or ""soothing"" technique; I suppose this might work, although you'd clearly need someone else to administer the stick while you did the grooming or whatever you were trying to do. And I wouldn't necessarily expect a dog to keep still just because s/he was licking...not my nutters, anyway. But, it's an idea, at any rate. It might well be a good anxiety-reducing distraction. They do get pretty excited over it, so depending upon the situation, it just might have that power.<br /><br />Edit: I'm sorry, but I had to lower the rating to two stars. You're far better off dripping the tasty, low-calorie liquid onto a hard surface and letting the dog lick it up. It should be sold as a kibble gravy or something to pour into a tiny bowl, rather than as a ""Lickety Stick.""<br />These things really do just splatter all over the floor/ground whilst taller dogs lick SOME liquid from the ball, and shorter ones risk being hit with falling droplets. It's a good idea, but perhaps the substance needs to be thicker, or it needs to pour out neatly into a little tray, or something. Some dogs are better at catching it all before it falls, but height differences make it tricky to try and let two of them share one, if they're both willing. You can do one in each hand, sure, but of course that doubles the mess. The secret, really, is to squeeze slowly and gently, watch for where it starts to emerge, and rotate the ball so that the dog can lick it before it slides around the ball and falls.<br /><br />I somewhat doubt my likelihood to recommend or re-purchase Lickety Stiks, unless they come out with a particularly interesting new flavor, or improve the stuff itself. Furthermore, my dogs have actually begun shrinking away and ignoring them, obviously mistaking the sticks for their tubes of tooth-cleaning gel and spray--not the product's fault, naturally, but still a newly noted disadvantage worth mentioning."
0,I tried with my dogs but they didn't like it at all. I ended up throwing it out .  Very messy.
0,"This is the strangest thing I've ever seen.  Imagine your roll on deodorant container  being filled with some bacon flavored  gravy and then allowing your dog to lick from it for his daily treat!  Are you kidding me?  This idea is gross and unsanitary and how do you get a dog to understand the concept that they are only supposed to take a few licks and that's their treat.  My dog kept trying to grab the container, she thought I was trying to tease her with it.  Finally I started rolling it on the dry milk bone type treats that she's not crazy about to get her to eat them.  If they called it ""Dog Bone Icing"" it might sell better  and make more sense."
0,"As much as our dogs enjoyed Lickety Stik, the cloying stench of ""savory chicken"" repulsed the rest of the family. The odor wafted off the stick and filled the room like a musky air freshener. We called it ""Icky Stik"" or ""Stinky Stik"" as the experience was so nauseating that no one volunteered to reopen the stick, despite pleas from our dogs.<br /><br />We tested the PetSafe Lickety Stik as part of the Amazon Vine program, which is to say the product arrived free. The company sent us the Savory Chicken flavor and we tested it with our Cockapoo and Miniature Schnauzer, both adult females. Neither dog had trouble figuring out how to advance the roller ball so they could taste the liquid. One warning: if you get this stuff on your hands you'll play heck trying to wash it off.<br /><br />A collective shudder ran through the family as we wondered: if Savory Chicken smells this bad, can you imagine inhaling a deep whiff of ""Braised Liver"" or ""Smoky Bacon""? Worse yet, the company touts the product's portability and recommends carrying it in your purse. That's a bit risk since this stuff in the bottle is hardly perfume.<br /><br />The company says Lickety Stick consists of all-natural ingredients. Here's the list from the bottle: Natural Chicken Flavors, Cultured Milk Lecithin, Mixed Tocopherois (Natural Preservative - A Source of Vitamin E), Ascorbyl Palmtate (Source of Vitamin C), Rosemary Extract, Green Tea Extract.<br /><br />In summary, with so many better options available for dog treats, we cannot recommend Lickety Stick because of its foul smell, sticky ingredients and the serious risk to your purse should the bottle leak.<br /><br />Rating: One star."
0,"This product is really dumb and pointless. My dog was simply not interested, and I was not interested in holding it in my hand while she licked it. When I ordered it, I thought I was getting something you could just give the dog, and she would entertain herself for a long time, by licking. It sounded like a good idea because my dog really likes to lick things. I give her something lick-able when I want her to go lay down and be quiet. This product is useless for that purpose. This is an interactive treat. You and your dog both have to interact with it. It gets old, pretty much immediately.<br /><br />The product itself is gross. It's sticky and unappealing. The smell is nauseating. My dog would take a sniff, and sometimes a trial lick, and then just walk away. I'd be left standing there holding a phallic shaped bottle of mysterious smelly goo.<br /><br />Here are some things my dog likes better than Lickety Stiks: dirty diapers, dead pigeons, week-old garbage, and other dog's butts.<br /><br />The only people who really enjoyed the product are the teenagers in my house, who think ""Lickety Stik"" is possibly the most hilarious product name they ever heard. The jokes lasted most of the afternoon. The packaging offers plenty of crude suggestions (""give a lick"" tm  they trademarked that??), as if my kids needed any encouragement. Even the shape of the bottle - a rigid cylinder with a ball on top - was fodder for hilarity. They thought it was just so funny.<br /><br />So this is a stupid product with a funny name and a suggestive shape, which solves no problems, has no appeal beyond comedy, and is completely worthless."
0,"Are we seriously supposed to stand there for hours and hold this bottle up in the air while the dog licks it? This is the new wave of dog ""treats""??<br /><br />To be honest, when I ordered this, I kind of missed the whole ""Likety Stik"" wording on the bottle. I mean I definitely saw the ""Likety"" wording, but didn't pay any attention to the ""Stik"" part. I saw that it was bacon flavored, so I assumed it was a bacon flavored substance almost like a gravy to pour over your dog's food, especially by the shape of the bottle.<br /><br />When it arrived, I was like what the heck is this?? At first glance you would almost assume it is roll-on deodorant, but then you see the picture of the dog in the middle of the bottle, so you know it can't be.<br /><br />But I did try giving this to all 3 of my dogs. None of them knew what to do with it and seemed aggrevated when they licked the ball and nothing would come out. I then figured out I had to squeeze the bottle to make the contents drip out. When I did that, they stopped licking, looked at the ball, took one whiff and turned their noses up in the air as if to say ""ewwww get this thing outta my face right now""!!<br /><br />I find that dogs (mine anyway) like to chew, so they kinda don't know what to do with this odd invention. They aren't rabbits who drink water from a water bottle. This reminded me of something like that. This is for an animal who is used to licking from a rolling ball. You can't exactly give it to a dog, then let them go off on their own with it like a normal treat or a bone, because rather than licking the ball, they would want to investigate what it's made of and would chew it to bits until the contents fell out. In my opinion, not a very good idea and could potentially be very dangerous. I really don't see the point in this item at all, unless of course you are a rabbit."
0,"I decided to try this ""treat"" with my new dog. I am trying to teach her different responses and thought that a treat that did not add calories to her diet would be a good idea.<br /><br />I introduced the treat to her and she ignored it at the beginning. The shape of the container is of one of the old fashioned roll-on deodorants. I moved the ball around to get some of the liquid on it and re-introduced it to my dog. She liked the flavor but was frustrated with it as the ball gets stuck. She tried a few times and ended up yanking the container from my hand and running away with it.<br /><br />She is a very fast dog and when I caught up with her she had managed to rip the ball of the container. Lucky for me she did not swallow the ball as I think it could have killed her. I picked up the ball and threw it away. I could not get container from her as she was busy using it as a chew toy.<br /><br />I will not be buying this product for her as it is hard to use and I do not think that she should be chewing on plastic. The contents were delicious to her as they were a chicken based.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product."
0,"Well when I ordered this product for my dogs I had high hopes that this would be something that they might like.  The concept is that the product looks like a deodorant roll on...if you remember those.  You take the top off, and then there is a roll over which the gravy-like product is dispensed.  The gravy is thick and difficult to get to start dispensing.  Once it does start coming out of the sides of the roller ball, the process of it coming out is inconsistent.  Sometimes it comes out slowly,  then sometimes you have to shake the bottle a  good bit to encourage the gravy to come out around the roll.  This usually means that you are having to futz around with this dog treat much more than you would like to have to.  The dogs also got a little discouraged with the process as well.  They would actually walk off and give up on me with a frustrated look on their face as if to say that this was hardly worth it."
0,"**Vine Voices will receive a total of 3 Lickety Stiks in separate flavors; Savory Bacon, Braised Liver, and Savory Chicken**<br /><br />Above is the description given for the Lick Sticks and the reason that I made that choice. What I received is one lick stick, not three. My Dobie loves Bacon and Liver so I was really looking forward to receiving both and figured he may be interested in the chicken as well. When I opened the envelope and saw just one lick thing I looked at the shipping invoice and it said that the one stik was bacon flavor. So, although puzzled at the lack  of the other two stiks I figured that at least he was getting to lick one of his favorite flavors. Not to be. The tiny bottle, about the size and apprearance of a small roll-on deodorant stick, was labeled ""Savory Chicken Flavor"". I figured I would give it a try and held it for my Dobie to lick. He gave me a scornful look indicating that he failed to find it ""Savory"" and walked away. I tried several more times but he began to give me a look that meant his patience was running thin. He is a large Dobie and very strong so I heeded his message and apologized by giving him a treat that ensured his forgiveness. The lack of receiving three sticks, the shipping invoice labeled as bacon flavored and the actual tiny bottle of disgusting chicken something are all a mystery to me."
0,"I would have preferred to directly inform the company that makes this product vs. writing a review on Amazon but I couldn't find a way to do that.<br /><br />First I would like to thank the makers of Lickety Stik for donating these things to a Canine Cancer walk I participated in this weekend.<br /><br />I have 2 dogs, as it seemed, one dog liked it and the other did not.<br /><br />I screwed the cap back on and put it on the counter while I took a shower and when I came out I found the Lickety Stik butsted open on my couch and leaking all over the place.  The plastic roller ball was no where to be found, when my dog seemed ill I became concerned that she ate it but I found it later, thankfully.<br /><br />I would not buy this product as my dogs are not usually mischievous or eat things that are not edible but this instance was too close for comfort.  I feel the construction of the container is weak."
0,"This was not at all what I expected. It was like the old-school roll-on deoderant from the 1970's. Only instead of fresh-scented anti-persperant, it was drippy, smelly, bacon-flavored dog juice.<br /><br />So I guess you're supposed to stoop down and hold the roll-on bottle in front of the dog while it licks the roller ball to get the dog juice on its tongue. You're supposed to do this without yacking from the smell. Meanwhile, there's a million dog treats out there that you can throw to the dog and he runs off and eats it and you're not doing deep knee bends to apply dog juice roll-on to your dog's already funky tongue.<br /><br />To say nothing of the fact that the dog just wants to take it and bite it. Like a dog would do.<br /><br />Try again. Fail."
1,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:42 Mins<br /><br /></span>Since neither of my 2 dogs can write about this new Lickety Stik, I will do my best.<br />A new idea for treats is always welcomed.  We had 3 flavors of Stiks, Bacon, Chicken and Liver.  We tried all three on both Sundae and Casey.  Sundae licked all three and seemed to like them all. Casey, however, wouldn't try any of the three, just turning his head in apparent disgust (lol).  Having had dogs my whole life, you never can tell what a dog will like or dislike.  I didn't give this 5 stars, because of some functional reasons, not because Casey didn't even try it.  First, the lick ball is exactly like a deodorant ball. As a matter of fact, the container reminds me of an Arrid Rollerball Deodorant bottle exactly.  It doesn't move freely by just licking, you have to gently squeeze the bottle for the liquid to be available to the dog.  If you squeeze too hard, it drips onto the floor. Other than that, it seems to be enjoyable.  It is supposed to be healthy, but I had to use a magnifying glass to read the rather small label.<br /><br />The video is one of our taste tests. Hope you enjoy it."
1,"- UPDATE - 10/28/2011<br />It's been several weeks of using it and there is still a ton of licking left, definitely getting my moneys worth out of this treat.<br />Another thing that has been nice is the ability to keep this in my pocket without making a mess. So going for a walk with it has been nice (and a great way to keep his attention when there are other not well behaved dogs around).<br />- UPDATE -<br /><br />Well the puppy dog has spoken... he loves Lickety Stik!<br /><br />When we first presented it to him he was a bit unsure and tried to bite the stick which was kind of cute but he quickly realized he had to lick it.<br />Now every time the Lickety Stik comes out as a reward or to teach him something, he just can't wait to lick the bejesus out of it.<br /><br />Not only does the dog love it and responds really well to it, it's made in the USA!<br /><br />This is a very unique, clean, easy to use, easy to carry, and fun treat for your dog. I would highly recommend this to most anyone. Way to go PetSafe!"
1,"We have a new puppy, and are attempting to train her using a rewards-based system. This works well, except that we don't feel comfortable giving her treat after treat after treat. Then, along came the Lickety Stik, and it solved our problem! Our puppy LOVES this, and it's become an invaluable training tool. We have bought several in different flavors and keep them in different rooms around the house. When our puppy is doing something she shouldn't be doing, we give her the appropriate command (""Off,"" ""Wrong,"" ""Leave It"" etc.). If she does what she's asked, we say ""Good Girl!"" grab the Lickety Stik, and she gets a couple of licks. This has worked amazingly well, and we're not stuffing the puppy with treats. There are some times when we feel she'll continue the bad behavior just to get a Lickety Stik, but that's the same with any treat. To solve this, once we know she understands the command, if she continues to do the behavior, she doesn't get the treat. She soon realizes that to get the Lickety Stik, she has to not do the behavior at all.<br /><br />Of course, your dog may be different, but this has been our experience.<br /><br />Also, my daughter is working at a local pet store as a grooming assistant, and she tells me that they have started using the Lickety Stik there to help calm their dogs and curb bad behavior while they're being groomed. I felt that was a pretty good endorsement right there."
1,"I am a veterinarian with 7 years experience, and I have 3 Great Danes.  I am always looking for safe, effective, fun, and innovative new pet products.  I saw the video for this product, and definitely agree that carrying a pocketful of crumbling treats isn't much fun for training/rewards, so decided to give it a try.  All 3 of my girls tried to bite the bottle at first (and I think most dogs will), but within a few seconds, all of them figured it out, and were licking away very happily, each taking their turn sitting down for me.  I also recently used it to help keep them standing still while my 8 year old daughter gave them baths outside with the hose on a nice warm day....much less mess than doing it in the tub inside!  It was also handy when we went for a short hike at a local park a while back, as I am training the 2 younger Danes to wear backpacks (that's a whole other story!).  Even if the dogs jump in the river wearing their backpacks and get them soaked, their treats won't get soggy.  The only thing I would like to see is using a liquid treat that's maybe a bit healthier for them...the ingredient list on the Lickety Stik looks like a lot of processed stuff.  It does have a bit of an odor, too, but I didn't find it that strong or offensive like some of the other people here did.  And I think it's the odor that really draws the dogs to come check it out...otherwise, why would they want to just lick a plastic roller ball?<br />Also, I think it would be nice to have a bottle that is just a little bit larger for the large/giant breeds like mine...but this does work well regardless.  Finally, I think it would be great to have a refillable bottle, so there would be less waste...500 licks goes fast when you're training 3 big dogs!<br />Oh, and yes, I will re-order this, and do recommend it."
1,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:29 Mins<br /><br /></span>*disclaimer* I was sent this item to review.<br />Izzy, our mini schnauzer, is very food motivated. Schnauzers have a tendency to get chunky though, so rewarding her with food every time she does a trick is a balancing act between giving her something she likes but not having her snack with treats all day.<br /><br />At 1 calorie per 10 licks, along with a fun interactive way to give her the treat, the lickety safe is fun and healthy. She had no trouble at all figuring out how to lick the deodorant like ball. This would also be a nice travel treat in the car because it closes up and you don't need to get treat on your fingers to give it to the dog."
1,This is a great training aid for all dog owners.  It also eliminates clumped up dog treats that end up in your pocket after you forget to remove them before tossing  you pants into the washing machine!!!!
1,Used the chicken flavor to train my 11 month puppy with his invisible fence.  He loved the treat and my pockets are no longer full of crumbs. Great product!
1,"What I really like about this treat is that it is something you hold while your dog licks it--rather than him taking his chewy someplace and getting busy with it, he ends up looking at me, holding my gaze for as long as I'll let him keep lickin' that rollerball. Awesome for my friend's dog who's old and can't chew. (This is the liver flavor--which smells awesome. The bacon did not ship, but my pup doesn't mind.)"
1,"I thought this looked interesting a liquid dog treat what? So I purchased it, I have two small dogs a seven year old Yorkie and a seven month old puppy Bichon Frise/ Toy Poodle mix. Well I showed it to the puppy I got the liver flavor it does smell bad and let him sniff it he went wild and starting jumping towards my hand trying to get it and barking like crazy I told him sit and paw and he did  and I give him a lick he loved it. Now my Yorkie sniffed it and walked away but she is extremely picky about her treats so it did not surprise me at all. I love how this is small can fit in a jacket and is about the length of your hand opened, this is low in calories 1 calorie in 10 licks and the bottle has 500 licks! this is great I clicker train my puppy and he knows a bunch of tricks but I always felt Like I was filling him up with a ton of treats and then would have to feed him less dinner and I felt bad. But with this I no longer have to worry now it can be messy if your not careful don't squeeze too hard, I will definitely be getting more of this and trying it in different flavors for my Pup Mozart. This is also great for teaching small dogs to heel to stay by your left side and it is great to use outside when the puppy gets distracted by people or other dogs kids etc I can refocus his attention on me and get him to calm down."
0,"This is a really fun idea! It is a fun treat to give them, and my dogs REALLY like it. The reason why I am giving it a low rating, is because it stinks, really bad! The smell is so offensive that my boyfriend won't let me feed this treat to my dogs while he's around. If my dogs didn't love the taste, and if it wasn't so much fun to feed to them, it would be in the garbage. I won't be buying it again, and don't recommend it. However, if you ever find it on sale or find a free sample or something, it is kind of a fun thing to try ONCE. Another issue is the fact that it comes in bacon and beef flavors, which can (and did) stain their mouths and cause dark tear stains."
0,"I have 3 larger dogs - labs and golden retrievers, and I wanted to try this out with them, but it turned out to be basically useless.  None of them can understand that they're not supposed to eat the bottle, and only 1 of my dogs will continue to lick it after he realizes he can't have it.  Another of my dogs got so frustrated with it that she refuses to even lick it if I bring the bottle out.<br /><br />It was an interesting idea, and exactly what it said it was, but, unfortunately, it was a failure at my house.  I can see where it might be useful for smaller dogs or puppies, but definitely not for my dogs."
1,"My dogs love the Lickety Stik! I got the bacon flavor, is there anything better than bacon? I use it to distract Joe when his nails are trimmed, he hates having his nails trimmed. Once I figured out that I need to squeeze it gently because the ball doesn't turn it worked fine. I hold it up and Joe licks it like a lamb with a bottle!"
1,This product is very helpful in training my dogs. I find that it's much more convienant then treats. I will certainly be ordering more.
1,"Both of the dogs love this Lickety Stik. It took one of them a bit longer to figure out the ""roller ball"", but once done, they both love it. I especially like the personal interaction I can have at treat time. My main use has been to use it after giving medicine. It works great and now my girl looks forward to receiving a few tasty licks (her spoonful of sugar!) after taking her medicine. Great, innovative product, at a good price."
1,"Got this for my 9 year old beagle.  She ""expects"" treats anytime she comes back in from outside and has pretty much figured out how to work that system with my 4 year old so she gets treats every 5 minutes (really need to figure out a better lock for the back door!).  I saw this Lickety Stik and the concept seems good.  I had read some reviews about certain dogs not liking this product at all but that is not the case with my beagle.  In fact, she LOVES this stuff and will sit near the counter staring up at it.  My only issue with this product is that it really stinks....and I mean really stinks!!  I try to quickly open it, let my beagle take a few licks and then close it as quickly as possible.<br /><br />It works very similar to how a roll on deoderant would work so if you haven;t used it for a few days, it may take some manual intervention to get the top of the ball wet enough to turn on its own.  I don't have any issues as my dog can easily get it started using her tounge.<br /><br />I will most likely try the other flavors of this since my dog likes it so much.  Plus, assuming this product is accurate in its description, cutting back on the fatty treats she normally gets will be a benefit to her health."
1,"My dog LOVES Lickety Stik in the bacon flavor. Since she likes it so much, I plan on getting the other flavors too. It's a great liquid treat for your dog. I highly recommend Lickety Stik."
0,"I was given a bottle of the savory bacon flavor for the purpose of trying it out and reviewing it. I've tried on several occasions both with the bottle and with putting some on my fingers in case it was how it is dispensed that was bugging her and my dog just wants nothing to do with it.<br /><br />I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 because the concept is interesting and also because my dog is very picky. It's not the first time she's refused a treat, so I didn't think it merited a star rating quite so bad as ""I hate it.""<br /><br />I won't be buying any, though, unless she has a radical change of heart very soon."
1,"Our dog is a hugh White English Bulldog about 3 ft tall and 6 feet long. She loves bacon and loves the flavor of this, but she tries to bite and take the bottle away.<br />The bottle is a roller ball like roll on deodorant, and being a big dog she could choke on this if she did get it in her mouth, which is why we give 4 stars. she loves water out of squeeze bottle and would think this would do better in that type of bottle.<br /><br />I would reccommend this for small to medium dogs, but not for the Mastif breeds."
1,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:22 Mins<br /><br /></span>I selected this item thinking I would try it out on my parents dogs, but when my husband saw it on the counter, he wanted to try it with Kitty. Ha! She hates everything; there is no way she is going to like this stuff. I was wrong. To my total and utter shock, my cat actually liked it. So, here's the video to prove it."
0,"I was surprised when opening the package this product came in and found this ""Lickety Stik"" device.  It looks like a bottle of roll-on deodorant and that's how it works.  My first dog liked it and figured out she is supposed to lick it, but my other dog wasn't sure what to do with it and wanted to chew it.  This is worrisome because if he got hold of it, he may turn it into a bunch of plastic slivers and I wouldn't want him swallowing those.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik treat is a new concept and I understand the idea, but I don't think it's quite there yet.  It's also a little unusual to stand there holding the pets' treat.  Usually, when giving a pet a treat, I expect to get a few minutes of peace and quiet while he/she is enjoying the treat. There are no directions on the bottle, so I wasn't sure how to use it at first, but it didn't take long to figure out.  You just hold it in front of the dog and they have to do the figuring.<br /><br />I probably won't be buying this again."
1,"So, my dog likes it. I'll just get that out there right away.<br />But, it's awkward to carry and can be messy (which I didn't think it would be) but since you have to sometimes give it a little encouragement to get anything to come out, sometimes it just decides ""Oh you want ALL of it!"" and I have a sticky snouted puppy.<br />And, she has since lost interest in it and prefers treats she can smell better."
1,"I can understand this might not be for every dog;  my mother's dog just tried to eat the whole roll-on.  But my dog has no issue with it at all and loves it.  I taught her to recycle using this, and she goes out of her way to find stuff to recycle so she can get some.  It's like feeding a baby lamb out of a bottle.  If you have trouble getting the stuff to come out, squeeze it a little because that gets a little more on the roller ball, maybe that will encourage them to just lick and not chew.  My dog even has fun selecting which flavor we're going to open next."
1,"I decided to try this out after seeing an ad in a Bass Pro Shops catalog. I have two chihuahuas. One of them loved it and could probably lick it all day. The other dog wouldn't go near it. All in all, I think it really just depends on the dog itself; hence the mixed reviews here. It's not a bad product by any means, but probably not something I'll be buying often - just more of a fun treat every so often."
1,"I was resorting to the old trainer's trick of smearing peanut butter on the fridge or a plastic stool, so my new rescue dog could happily lick it off while I brushed him. It worked but it was very messy. Lickety Stik works much better, although I do generally need a helper to hold it while I groom. The big test will come when I next take him to the vet and bring LS along--will it work the same while he's getting his temperature taken? Or will the experience of the thermometer ruin the treat for him? If the former, I'm sure all the vets and techs at our clinic will be ordering this stuff! I was a little concerned with the stuff upsetting my dogs' digestive systems: the new guy has an  iron gut it seems but my other dog has a sensitive tummy. She, however, had some (inserted herself while I was grooming the newbie) and was o.k. We were using liver flavor. Overall, I'm very impressed so far and ordering some more."
0,"This product should have more explicit warnings on the packaging. My husband and I bought this as a treat for our 55 lb Doberman/Boxer mix. He loved the flavor and it served as a great distraction if we wanted to clean his ears or trim his dew claws. Unfortunately, with one swift bite he popped the roller ball into his mouth and down his throat. We needed to rush him to the emergency room where they induced vomiting and then monitored closely for 2 days at home until he threw it up on his own .... After surfing the internet we found numerous other claims with people having the same issue- some even needing to spend a few thousand on procedures to remove the ball.  Additionally, customer service for this company was a HUGE disappointment.  They were unshmpathetic and kept on about how it was not meant for chewing."
0,I was recommended this for my 15 pound rescue dog and her ongoing training.I initially loved the product...till she clamped down on the neck of the bottle sending the small down (roller) down her throat...I was very very lucky as I administered Peroxide immediately and she brought back up after 5 minutes...but please be aware that this can be dangerous
1,I think the packaging is ingenious -- who would have thought to put great meat juices into what looks like a bottle of roll on deodorant!<br />YAAAA -- 10 points for ingenuity !  And the dogs love licking the little roller.<br />If only it was re-fillable !
1,My 2 dogs love licking the treat and I don't feel guilty about too many treat.<br />Excellent to practice commands.
1,"Lickety Stik lickable pet treat from PetSafe are a hit at my house. My dog gets excitement every time I pulled it out.  It seems to be as good as a a moist treat without the sticky mess. A tidy rollerball dispenses all-natural liquid goodness --my dog just lap it up!<br /><br />All-natural flavors, naturally preserved<br />Only 1 calorie in every 10 licks<br />Over 500 licks per bottle<br />No mess roller-ball<br />Great for training<br />Conveniently fits in your pocket"
1,"I still carry regular treats in my pocket but this product is great. It is like a deodorant roll top. It is made in the USA and has only 1 calorie per 10 licks. So far my golden has liked all th e flavors. It is something different and when I am trying to keep his attention on me and not on a passing dog, I have it"
1,"I bought this product hoping to find something that will help me when I am trying to brush my 3 Siberian Huskies.  Lickety works better than I expected, they will stand for 45 minutes to get brushed if I use this.  Huskies are picky in what they will eat, but this is like cat nip to them."
1,"I have a three month old pug puppy who is incredibly food motivated.  Carrying around treats on a walk while I'm leash training him can be a hassle to fish out without spilling the rest or getting crumbs in my pockets.  We received a free sample of Lickety Stik at our puppy training class because of a pug's tendency to pack on the pounds and I was really surprised at how quickly the puppy took to it.  He will do tricks and readily follow on the leash to get a lick of this treat and becomes excited when he sees the bottle.<br /><br />The main drawback to this thing is that it stinks to high heaven and if I get a strong whiff of it the thing makes me gag.  The dog loves it, however so I am really considering buying more of this product in the future."
1,I got the Lickety Stik through the Vine Program.  I was a little skeptical upon ordering.  I have two dogs that both need daily medications and they also get vitamins.  It was always a battle to get them to take either and had to revert to the shove down the throat and blow on the nose tactic.  That is until now.  Put a little of this stuff on whatever they need to take and wham gone down the throat.  It took about a week and then I stopped using it and the dogs now take their pills without any treatment.  Highly recommend and made my life a little easier.
0,"This is a really fun idea! It is a fun treat to give them, and my dogs REALLY like it. The reason why I am giving it a low rating, is because it stinks, really bad!

Another issue is the fact that it comes in dark flavors, which can (and did) stain their mouths and cause dark tear stains."
1,"Great training aid. Very easy to use.  My puppy will follow this Lickety Stik anywhere!  After a while, just shaking the container gets her running to me."
1,"Many of these reviews seemed to be confused. This Stik if really created and used for training dogs/puppies. It is much easy to give them a quick lick when they walk next to you instead of giving them lots of treats or clicks. This product is a god-send. My puppy loves it and walks much better on the leash as a result. Also, just because you dog doesn't like the taste doesn't mean this deserves a poor review. Dogs have different tastes! For what this does, it deserves a better rating."
1,"This is great stuff!  I have a dog w/ no teeth and he could not have treats w/ the others.  Problem solved!  He LOVES this.  It's a bit messy but I've learned how to ""administer"" the treat w/ minimal dripping.  My others beg for it but I save this for my 19 y.o. toothless guy.  What a pleasure to be able to reward him too after potty call!"
1,"Likety Stik is a great product for some dogs obviously, but Foxy, my ten-year-old standard poodle, is not interested. She first thought she was to take the entire container into her mouth. When I didn't give her the opportunity to try to swallow the whole thing, she tasted the juice on the ball. Deciding it was pretty good, she looked around to see if any other dogs might just have happened to come by for a visit. She is a picky eater. When she reacts by looking to see if any other dogs are around, it is evident that something is extra tasty. If she really, really likes something super tasty, she doesn't take the time to look around for other dogs. She has licked it a few times, but she seems somewhat reluctant. The low-calorie idea is neat, but my picky eater needs all the calories she can get.<br /><br />From a people's perspective it seems a good product, but no matter how much I shake it, I find it necessary to turn the ball manually to make the juice available. It would be fun to try this stick on a dog with more enthusiasm about food.<br /><br />Four stars."
1,"Our dog really likes this thing.  It smells like it is full of flavor, and he seems to really enjoy licking the thing for as long as I'll hold it for him.  If you are unfamiliar, the flavored juice in the container is released each time the dog licks a small ball at the tops of the container; as the ball spins, it gets covered in the juice, which the dog licks off, etc.  So, well done!  My one beef with the product, though, is that the ball is a little tough to get spinning until it is fully lubricated, which means that I often have to use my fingers to get it started, which isn't ideal because I don't want to get any of the flavored juice on me.  That said, my dog is a big fan of this product.  So, while I think this is a good product, I'm giving it four stars because I think the delivery mechanism (ie the ball) isn't the best, and could be improved upon."
1,My dog loves this and she has learned amny tricks fast.  The best part is that it doesn't put weight on her.  I use it all the time.  Highly recommned it as a traiing aid.
1,"Yes, this must be very good, all of the dogs loved it, and didn't want to stop licking it.  They lined up waiting their turn.  Would recommend as a treat."
0,"My dogs seem to find Likety Stik extremely tasty as demonstrated by their desire to keep licking it. On my part, however, there are some reservations.  I have the liver flavor and for one, it is one of the worst smelling doggie treats that I have.  Not too sure if people want to carry this around in their purse. The stick works like a rollerball, like some of the anitperspirants you see out on market.  When you first open, it does not roll very easily, but eventually it will get going after your dog licks it a few times.  The second major reservation that I have is that if it is being licked, then the part my dog just licked cleaned, saliva and all, goes back into the fluid reservoir which doesn't seem too clean to me. Some may argue that this shouldn't make any difference to my dog who loves licking his hooha and whose favorite appetizer is cat poop, but I cannot help to think that this may be a festering ground for bacteria.  This may be prevented by having certain chemicals present that inhibit this possibility, but then it loops back to my concern of feeding these to my dog.  Although novel, I don't really see a benefit of having this as a treat other than the caloric count."
1,"I got the savory chicken flavor for our dog, and he totally loves it. He'll perform any trick just to get some licks. It's easy to use and there's no mess. Great idea for a product! I plan to buy more!"
1,I have 2 large dogs who I allow to lick this every day. They seem to like it.  It must smell and taste good to them.  I like giving this to them as a treat for doing something good instead of something with a higher calorie content.
1,"I tried this product on a new dog I had in training, because I liked the idea of a liquid for increased reward value.  It has turned out to be a great reward for many dogs I work with as well as a great reward in numerous situations.  In many performance sports you need to be very careful when rewarding your dog on a practice field that there are no crumbs left behind.  This product is PERFECT!!  I also don't need to worry about my pockets getting eaten out of my pants after training.<br /><br />My advice is to watch the price you pay here!!!!  I buy mine locally at less than 1/2 the price you see advertised here.  Even Petsafe will sell it to you for $8.99 not $13!!!<br /><br />Otherwise certainly a 5 star product!!!!!"
1,"We have two little dogs and they have shared the licks.  I can't speak to the taste, but I feel like I'm giving them puppy crack because they became very upset when I put the stick up.<br /><br />As a human, I'm a little less enthused about the whole thing.  First, it's more like a bottle of shoe shine than a bottle of deodorant.  So, as you turn it upside down, you have to squeeze the bottle a smidge to bring the liquid to the ball.  Squeeze too hard, and your dog will get a face full of Lickety Stik juice.  The dog doesn't mind, though.<br /><br />Both dogs started to try to chew the bottle.  They sort of got the hang of it, but I'm not sure that I'm giving them a life lesson here or anything.  It's certainly not worth the patience, for instance, used in showing a toddler how to drink from a straw.<br /><br />Still, as a novelty, I'm cool with this.  I really do think the dogs will get militant when the bottle runs out, though.  For all I know, it's just sugar water, but whatever it is, they really like it."
1,"The five stars are from Panda the Puppy.  This thing smells horrible, and looks disgusting, but the puppy loves it. He loves it so much that I can tolerate the horrible smell for him.  Panda loves treats, like most puppies, but this treat in particular gets his attention. It is working as a great training aid too.  He sits, he licks.  It is a treat that he is motivated to work for, and it makes training easier. We do have other treats that work, but this one has the benefit of a fast grab. I don't have to dig in a bag or really search for it."
1,"This is like a deodorant bottle with gravy in it.  My dogs took to it right away and did every trick as if I had a chunk of steak in my hands.  I figure it's a lot cheaper than conventional treats and not as messy as wet ones.  You do have to squeeze the fluid out sometimes so if they aren't ready for it, it drips.  If you aren't over a rug or other cloth surface it's not a problem, because they'll lick it off the floor.  I do have to keep it out of reach when I'm not using it because I'm afraid they'd jump up when I'm not looking and run off with it for me to discover it all chewed up with a stained carpet under it!"
0,"My dog was pretty confused when I put this in his face. Whenever I do he'll lick it once or twice then step back and look at me like, ""Can I have a real treat now?"" At least he doesn't hate it, but he sure doesn't get excited about this whenever I pull it out.<br /><br />But don't go off my review alone, other dogs seem to like it. Just not my poodle."
1,"OK, so my dog loves this and she is a picky eater.  I literally had to force her mouth open and give a roll of it on her tongue and she has been hooked ever since.  I usually only give her high quality treats and chews but I figure a few licks of this roll on won't her her.  I don't think I will buy it because it really is not a healthy treat for her but since she likes it and it does not make a mess I gave it 4 stars.  If it was better nutritionally I would have given it 5 stars.  This is definitely a great concept!  I just wish is contained better ingredients.  : )"
1,"This is the most unique dog treat I've seen. The liquid treat is dispensed from a container that reminds me of a large lip gloss tube with a roller. I've given this unique dog treat ""4 stars"" instead of five as an average based on the varied reactions from my two small dogs. The smaller Malti-poo loved the treat and from his reaction would give it ""5 stars"". He immediately licked the roller, received the treat, and wanted more. Our Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a pickier eater in general and wouldn't even try it at first. He finally did, but didn't seem to like it. We have the chicken flavor and it may be he just didn't like the flavor.<br /><br />Since our Malti-poo likes it so much, I have just ordered the three-pack that has chicken, liver, and bacon flavors. The three-pack is a better value than the individual packs and I'm hoping our Cavalier will like one of the other flavors better than the chicken. This is a unique idea to reward dogs with a treat without filling them up like traditional dog treats.<br /><br />** Update:  I ordered the three-pack and my Cavalier definitely likes the bacon flavor much better than chicken!"
1,"I came across this PetSafe Lickety Stik and decided to give it a try.  We just got an 8 week old Bassett Hound puppy and decided to try out this Lickety Stik as a training reward due to its low calorie content.  Bassets are know to get fat quick so a low calorie reward is needed as Bassetts basically only respond to food.<br /><br />Basically, this thing has the same construction as a stick of roll-on deodorant.  You turn it upside down, the liquid inside saturates the ball in a second or so and your dog takes a lick or two of the ball.  It works fantastically for training a puppy or dog.  We got the bacon flavor and she absolutely loves it.<br /><br />The puppy loves it and will do anything to get a lick of this thing.  It smells terrible to us(a really disguisting rancid bacon odor)but she absolutely adores it.  The price of $8 may seem a little high, but we've have been using the same Stik for over a month now, numerous times each day and we still have a third of it left.  We will definitely be buying more of these.<br /><br />Lickety Stik is a fantastic product that is great for training or just a treat.  Highly recommended!"
1,"Imagine doggie treat flavored underarm deodorant.... have to squeeze just a bit to get the roller wet, then turn upside down and let the dog lick it. Unique idea.  Would probably be useful as a training tool. Our dog definitely likes it.  I imagine this works best as a daily treat. I shudder to think what would happen if you let the roller dry out, dog ends up with a tounge rash trying to push the roller past the dried out spot... or worse, squeeze to hard and drip doggie treat juice all over!! I'm just saying...  :)<br /><br />All in all, worth a try for the dog that has everything or just needs a change of taste...<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay"
1,"I have two dogs, one Black Labrador and one Chihuahua.  The Lab can't get enough of this stinky treat and even tries to grab it from me with her teeth.  She will lick on it all day if I let her. The Chihuahua sniffs it and snubs it. She couldn't be less interested. So, one out of two dogs loves this stinky treat.  Humans, on the otherhand, hate the strong smell.  I think it's fun and can imagine it is a great treat substitute for obese dogs who need to watch their calorie intake. If you aren't adverse to strong odors you'll love the handiness of this Lickety Stik!"
1,"I am only reviewing the Bacon flavor, but my dogs picked up on how this works pretty quickly and love the taste of it.  At first they wanted to bite the bottle and chew it like a treat but I worked with them for about a minute or so and they got down that you only lick it.  I have 3 dogs and all three of them liked the taste of it.  I like it because it seems like a more personal treat than just a dog biscuit.  I recommend this!"
0,"I am of the curious sort when it comes to dog treats and new ways to reward dogs so I jumped at getting this product.<br /><br />Lickety Stick arrived and three dogs were eagerly sitting in front of me; a cocker spaniel, a norwegian elkhound, and an australian shepherd.<br /><br />I unwrapped the stick and squeezed a little juice out of the tube onto the roller. I presented it to all three dogs. The cocker spaniel and the aussie eagerly licked away. The aussie licked away so much the cocker needed a wet cloth over the top of her head due to dropping juice on her head. The elkhound however, wanted no part in it.<br /><br />After a couple days of using it and trying it out I am left with the premise that it's an interesting take on a a dog reward - but in the end, the execution and possibility of making a mess leave this treat stuck in the treat drawer. I don't see myself buying these in the future."
1,"I guess I didn't really read the description of this product very well, but this was not what I expected! It is like a little roller ball of deodorant only it is filled with liquid log treats. (this one is bacon) It was easy to open, but I did have to squeeze the bottle a little and then roll the ball around to get the initial liquid to come out. Once my dog realized what she was supposed to do, she was ALL OVER IT. In fact, she got so excited that she made her self sick. I'm saving this one for an ""every now and then"" treat."
1,"What a great idea for a treat.  Lickety Stik is constructed like a roll-on deodorant with a flavored dog treat inside.  Hold the Stik upside down and my dog licked away at it.  It is low calorie (great for my dog who is on a diet). It is also very easy to carry.  I keep it in my pocket.Since it has a cap and has plastic construction, it doesnt get crushed in my pocket. It makes a great little reward during training sessions.<br /><br />I find it especially helpful to reward my dog when Im teaching him a new trick. With the lickey stik he was very eager to see the stik come out.<br /><br />A few notes on the Lickety Stik's use.  The first time you use the Lickety stik, you may have to move the roller-ball with your fingers to get the treat to flow a little.  Once the dog understands that licking the ball makes the treat flow, it is not an issue. Also when he is done licking, there is no dripping.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik also has a clear window at the base of of the bottle so you know when it is time to reorder.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik is not large which makes it easy to trasport. However it does mean that if it is your primary treat for you dog, you may run out quickly.<br /><br />Overall, I can say that the dog was enthusiastic about the stick. It was easy to use. It was fun to give. I am happy with this product."
1,"When I picked up the padded envelope from our mail basket, my cocker spaniel snapped to attention.  By the time I had the bottle out of the envelope, the Rottweiler had joined us.  Their anxiety grew as I struggled to break the plastic wrap around the top.  Finally I had the bottle ready for action, after a very long 30 seconds.<br />I had to rub the roller ball to get the liquid inside to lubricate the ball.  Squeezing the bottle forces the liquid to ooze around the ball.  Both dogs wanted to eat the bottle rather than lick the ball.  They give it a five-star review and suggest that the Vine program send more to our house.<br /><br />The rottie still wants to eat the bottle. The cocker has learned the licking technique.  The cocker is quite responsive to the sound of the bottle being shaken. (Cockers are the original foodies.)<br /><br />The major problem I have is that the ball does not move freely.  I get some liquid on the ball and hold it out for the cocker.  She licks it very clean.  Then I have to squeeze more liquid out and roll the ball around with my thumb.<br /><br />The ingredients seem to be healthy, or as healthy as something with bacon fat in it can be.<br /><br />This product can be a great training reward, but you will have a sticky thumb. The first time I offered my thumb to be licked clean, the cocker started to eat it. If you are training your dog, you probably will want a rag to keep your thumb clean.<br /><br />My vine review philosophy is to first test the product without regard to price.  Now that I have checked the price, currently around $8, it seems a good value for a training tool.  $8 does not buy a decent size bag of training treats.  And the dogs are much more responsive to the bacon than to freeze-dried lumps.  However as just a treat for being a good dog in general, it is not as satisfying as a regular-sized biscuit.  Pity my poor dogs who are only getting this one bottle of bacon treat."
1,"First off, i would have to say that I did not find the Bacon flavor to be appealing at all.<br /><br />OK I'm kidding.  I didn't actually lick it.<br /><br />But my dog did, and she loves it.<br /><br />The basics:<br />The container is like a roll-on antiperspirant.  If you use roll-on deodorant, and buy this product, you may accidentally sport a new aroma if you are particularly groggy in the morning.<br />Its a no-calorie treat if your dog is ... uh... ""easy to see"" as they say.  My dog is a bit thick (like a barrel on stilts), so I had some high hopes for this product.<br /><br />The pros:<br />My dog loves it.<br />Its low calorie.<br />No crumbs!<br /><br />The cons:<br />You can't throw it in the laundry room as an easy way to get them to be put up.<br />I had to hold it upside down, and it would drip.<br />When my dog is aggressive she threatens to take it away from me.<br /><br />Overall, I would say that this is one of the few products that delivers exactly what it promises.  I recommend it."
1,"For those that follow my reviews you know I have many dogs so I just had to try out this product.  It was so funny the day I received it. I was surrounded with furry friends. Incase you don't know dogs can smell just about anything and they knew something was in my hands that they were going to like.  The container reminds me of roll-on deodorant.  I know that sounds gross but nevertheless it did. It is made where the dogs lick the top of it to receive their treat.  Okay, now all I had to do was let the dogs lick it and believe me they were ready.  They piled around me and all took their turns, it was so cute.  Now, did they come back for more?  You bet they did, each seeing who could get their tongue on it first.  I could tell to them it was a tasty treat and for me it was a time to interact with my animals and show them love. You can't just let them play piggly wiggly and lick it all in one day, because they would, believe me. You have to allow only so many licks.  I liked this product and so did my dogs and plan to purchase it for them. Dog biscuits are of course a lot easier, you just throw them and they catch, but this is a special treat that allows you time with your animal. Nice product."
1,"The Lickety Stik is fabulous!  My dog immediately took to it and gets so excited when he sees the bottle.  I have been trying to train him to fetch a ball and then give it back to me, but I have had to wrestle the ball away from him.  I was worried about giving him too many treats because of calories, not to mention the expense.  I started letting him lick the Stik once or twice each time I got the ball away from him.  It didn't take long before he would drop the ball when he saw the Stik, and now he puts it directly into my hand, just so he can lick the Stik. I plan on using it to train him to do other things, as well.<br /><br />Considering how many times I have used it, it is a good value for the money.  It's kind of awkward to give him as a regular dog treat, so I save it for training and give him dog biscuits or other treat."
0,"First of all, let me say that my dog likes the taste of this treat - a lot. However, I have a large dog...and evidently an impatient dog. Rather than lick this ""roll-on"" treat, she would rather just bite it and chew it. That's really the only down side. Found out my daughters kitten liked it too. It's weird, like a 1980's deodorant company trying to do something profitable with their out of date product line. I wouldn't buy it, but my pets liked it."
0,"I was excited to get the Lickety Stik for my dogs. It sounds like a good idea BUT the roller part DOES NOT roll and in order for the dog to get something to taste you must squeeze the container which can be a mess. I have four dogs, as I dog train in obedience and in tracking. In the beginning all four were interested, but then they all became frustrated with it. I ended up with $25.00 of this garbage. SAVE YOR MONEY.it's not worth it!"
1,"I have three beagles and a lab.  To be honest, when I read about this product, I was dubious as to its ability to make them happy.  A lick?  That's it?<br />Well--I was right, and wrong.<br />When I first broke it out, the lab tried to eat it--he wasn't happy with the one lick.  The beagles saw him try to eat it, and then they were all about eating it, too.  But once they realized what it was all about, they LOVED it.  They were like crack addicts.  I put it on the dining room table, out of reach, and we kept catching them walking on their hind legs, noses over the table ledge, trying to get it.  They got so sneaky!  Climbing onto the chair?  Really?  When it was time for bed, when they usually get a cookie, they all ran to the table and gave me the distinct message--""WE want THAT!""<br />Last night I put the Lickety Stik on a tall shelf in the hallway of the house--and this morning, they ""knew"" exactly where it was, and wouldn't leave the hallway until I grabbed the thing and walked them outside.<br />So, we're calling it either crack for dogs or catnip for dogs haha..<br /><br />It's sort of like a roll-on deodorant style container.  The beef-gravy-like substance covers the ball and they simply lick it off.  Of course, as I said above, they will try to eat it at first, until they get the idea.  Although I'm convinced that should it get left within reach, they will eat the entire container.)<br /><br />It's a small container--about 5 inches long.  The picture made me think it would be much larger."
0,"My two dogs apparently loved the scent and taste based on the way they were all over the Stik as soon as I uncapped it. The problem was the roller ball. It didn't roll very well. This became the pattern -- place thumb on ball, roll, let dogs lick off residue, place thumb on ball, roll again ... It became tedious very quickly. My main dog grew impatient and latched onto the bottle with his back teeth, easily piercing the neck allowing the flavored goo to ooze out. I tossed the Lickety Stik lickety split."
0,"This product is a bit odd, to say the least. It is designed in a roll-on deodorant type of bottle and your dog must lick the rolling ball to enjoy his treat.<br /><br />When first trying to get my dog to try it, he really looked at me, looked at the bottle, looked at me, looked at the bottle etc. You could literally see in his eyes that he was wondering what the heck he was supposed to do, or what I wanted him to do. Finally he took a swipe at it with his tongue. I assume he was unimpressed because he made no effort to go for another lick, despite my encouragement.<br /><br />The whole idea is just weird. I give my dog treats as well..treats, or to reward good behavior, or just to be nice, or to get him to lay/settle down for a little - in other words to keep him busy for a few minutes or so. This type of treat obviously goes against the idea of keeping him occupied for awhile while keeping my time free since you have to sit/stand there and hold the bottle for him. Now, don't get me wrong, we always have a variety of snacks on hand and I would not mind standing there holding this bottle for him if he actually liked the treat. It's just one of those little extra things we do to show our love. However, he just seemed to not like the taste once he did figure out to lick it, otherwise I assume he would have continued to lick.<br /><br />The texture of the liquid inside just looks gross to me. It is a clearish, somewhat dark brown color. Kind of like pancake syrup although not as sticky/tacky.<br /><br />If your dog will lick the roller ball and likes the taste, then I guess it is a good buy, but if not it is obviously a waste.<br /><br />I also cannot help but wonder who sat around and thought ""Hmmmm, let's create a liquid dog treat and put it in a roll-on deodorant dispenser!!"""
0,"My dogs would not lick it or even pay attention to it. I thought it would be great for training as I am a consumate treat ""dropper"", but they were not the least interested. Too bad"
1,"First and foremost make sure you DO NOT let this tea steep too long. If you let it steep for the recommended two minutes, you shouldn't have to run to the bathroom like your pants are on fire! If you let it steep for the 2 minutes, it's a decent trip to the bathroom...not explosive diarrhea.<br /><br />With the way we eat (mostly women) we need to clean out our plumbing every once in a while and this is a fabulous way to do it. It's not recommended for everyday use!"
1,This product is great it really works. I have lost a total of 15 pounds in two months wihout exercising. I reconmend this product to everyone.
1,"I did not buy this tea through amazon.. But from my grandmothers cabinet(haha). I have been dieting for the past 3 months now, and i was completely oblivious to special teas for cleansing although i know of drinks/pills that cleanse, I wanted to steer clear of any type of pill and again oblivious to benefits of cleansing(even when not dieting). Now I tried this tea two months ago & only because of the words ""Super Dieters"" I thought ohh special tea so i drank it(in the evening) it did for me do its job and loosen things up which i found odd at first then i read the package, and then I got it. So for me it did help being that I usually dont um go as much as I should and this has helped that. Not only that but since I have been using it along with my eatting habits, and exercise my diet has been showing better results nothing drastic but still better results and that is always great! This tea (Cinnamon Spice) I think tastes devine, I do add not even a teaspoon of sugar but I think this tea doesn't even need sugar at all(i just like it sweeter). But all in all I do and have recommended this tea to a few family members and friends(who do and dont diet) because i love the taste and the results I'm having with it."
1,"I love this product, it helps keep things moving!  I use it twice a day afternoon and evening while dieting.  A great product for helping maintain your weight."
1,This product works very well. It taste great. Its a nice touch to the end of a day. PLEASE USE AS DIRECTED! PLEASE!!!!!
1,Works great for me and also help me with my weight.  I don't like the drink as much but I drink it as needed.
1,"I have used this product in the past and was highly satisfied. It works very well. I would just caution first time users not to make the tea too strong or your results may be ""too good""."
1,"I like this product, but I wouldn't use it daily. I learned this the hard way. It is stronger then you think!!!!!"
1,"This tea product got me running alright, to the crapper. But it did help loose about 10 lbs, mostly compacted fecal matter. I also feel more energized and feeling alot better. Before taking this product my best friend was a couple of cups of black coffee but since taking this for the last month my craving for coffee and sweets has subsided, however i now have to bulk up on toilet paper. Great product great buy!"
1,I love this tea the taste is really good and it smells good as well my husband and I are year around tea drinkers and also we dont even have to add any sugar ( well I use honey on some teas) but this one you don't need anything extra and I will say it really does work drink plenty of water threw out the day .... And usually in the am you will be cleaning  it out lol ... I didn't have any stomach pains or anything but I eat well also!! I recommend this to any and everyone!!
1,"I never drink this tea alone. I always steep it with another tea, such as Oolong or Jasmine because the taste isn't the best. I use honey and sugar to sweeten and down the hatch it goes! Expect some, um, gastrointestinal responses the next day. Sometimes I feel a bit of cramping and sometimes I don't. Sometimes it will take most of the next day for it to 'work'...and sometimes it won't!!"
1,"I have been using this tea for a few years now, and I drink the full 2 cups every night before I go to bed.  It begins to take effect the next morning.  I gave a bag to a friend to try & she loved it as well, she now orders it online."
1,"This tea works on my fiance's digestive track as she has an issue with colitis and this product along with essential enzymes helps her to absorb and digest foods that otherwise would give her pains while in her digestive track, Thank you for making this product we plan to continue using it as long as we can."
1,"I have been using Laci Le Beau Super Dieters Tea for years.  There is no subsitute.  Many women in my family use it as well.  This keeps me moving better than anything else and I suffer from Chronic Constipation.  I would recommend this to anyone who could use a gentle, natural laxitive.  I've never felt like I've taking a harsh stimulant, it just makes you feel & go like normal :)  I hate poop talk but this is worth sharing!  LOL"
1,"One must know that this dieter's tea helps mostly by moving your bowels along.  Be careful at first, or it will be unpleasant!"
1,"I don't use this tea for dieting but more so for a natural cleanse to keep the body free of harmful toxins.  It is very effective have used it for years!  First time users may experiece cramping but, after awhile they cease.  Great Effective Product!"
0,"the one i got says ""cleanse"" on the box, I don't know what it means, but I know that I picked the one that doesn't say ""cleanse"" on the box. i'm all the more angry because that one costs way cheaper. and all the more am i angry because i'm not going to bother to go through the refund process. plus it took it ages to arrive"
1,A lot of tea for the price... ...no sweetener needed... The product works better than I expected it to. I also didn't realize how much I was ordering. I am enjoying this product. Has very good taste.
1,"This tea has a superb taste.  I actually look forward to drinking this tea with my dinner.  Now that it is summer I drink is as an iced tea, but this is also a very delicious hot drink too!  I use splenda and fresh mint when I brew it.  Fabulous!"
1,Reality strikes.  I have been drinking this tea every night for 10 years !  It is the best thing to keep me on the straight n narrow!
0,"though i did not purchase this through amazon, i did get this recently from thw grocery store, and have to admit im really disappointed.  i followed the instructions the first evening EXACTLY as instructed with the included paper, and no results.  the second day, i brewed just a little longer, still no luck, (basing this off some other comments from other users here on amazon) then today i only did 6oz, not 12 as the paper instructs, and even brewed this for 6 minutes.  still nothing.<br /><br />i really wanted this to work for me like it has for others, i had heard good things and was so excited, but still no luck.  i guess im one of those people this doesnt affect. ill keep trying it daily till i run out, but looks like ill have to try something else.<br /><br />as for taste, its not bad. just tastes like tea leaves, not deliciously fantastic, but not nose-pinchingly undrinkable. good luck to anyone else. hope you have more success with this than i did"
0,I have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about. I followed the directions nothing happened. Brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.Even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea. On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else. Strange.
0,"I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed. As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me."
1,I was very happy with my order.  It arrived on time and as described.  Thank you!!
1,Yummy spices. It's nice that it comes in 3 smaller containers. The moisture in the air makes it stick together a bit.
1,This is a great spicy rub. I made a bbq brisket with it and combined it with a smokier rub and it turned out incredible. highly recommend. Also used for chicken with equally fantastic results
1,"I love this stuff ! contains no gluten for us who are sensitive! i use this for homemade chicken wings, either on the grill or in the oven. also great on ribs.great mixture of spice and sweet, not to hot.also have used it for making a dip for chips etc.mix with sour cream and/or cream cheese.YUMMMMMMM!"
1,"This stuff is great to have around.  I won't eat Pizza without it.  It's great for adding some flavor to bland, starchy foods (rice, potatoes, cous-cous).  Also try it on green beans and brocolli.  I brought a can of this to work and now everyone uses it on their food."
1,"This rub has lots of flavor and is not to sweet.<br />I have used it on roasted whole chicken, broiled and grilled breasts of chicken.<br />Rubbed only 20 minutes before use.<br />The color is wonderful.<br />Also rubbed on pork chops and let them sit in the refrigerator overnight. Moist and delicious.<br />As an interesting twist sprinkle some on mashed potatoes and popcorn."
1,This is a terific sauce for faijitas!  Highly recommended.
1,"This is a divine chocolate, rich and full-flavored as many of the Cote D'Or products tend to be. It is a blend of roasted cocoa beans from West Africa and beans from South America as well. This is amazing alone but even better when paired up with a creamy espresso."
1,"These bars are very tasty.  And I got a low sales price so they were much less overpriced than such bars usually are.  But I consider them to be more like slightly-less-sweet cookies than like health bars -- not that there's anything wrong with that.  They come two thin ones per pouch, so though you get 72 total, there are only 36 pouches.  And most people would consider one pouch to be one serving, so you're getting 36 servings here, not 72.  Also, the bars are extremely crumbly so I suggest having something underneath when you eat them to catch all those crumbs (or have a cordless vacuum handy if you eat these in the car)."
1,"Like most of us I bought these for a snack. Great for emergency snack to at 160 calories for 2 bars(2bars in one envelope).<br /><br />These bars taste great as most of the reviews agree.<br /><br />The APPLE CRISP is my favorite flavor!<br /><br />GREAT VALUE: 6 Boxes for $16.5 with subscribe and save. Each box has 6 packets with 2 bars. So, 6 boxes of 6 packets per box = 36 packets = 46 cents per pack of 2 bars. Delivered to your door!<br /><br />Basic Nutrition (1 packet of 2 bars): Total fat 6 of 42 grams. Zero cholesterol. 11 of 42grams are sugar. 140mg sodium. Protein 3 of 42grams. Dietary fiber 2 of 42grams. Protein 4 of 42grams. These won't hurt you and they do not replace a good well balanced meal.<br /><br />Crunchy: These can be messy to eat. When you take a bar out of the packets, crumbs fall out. I solved this by pulling both bars out of the packet over a sink or trash can. Shake loose all the crumbs then put them back in the packet. Problem solved.<br /><br />For those that think these are too crunchy. Try: break off a piece and leave it in your mouth less than one minute then chew. I do this and it works great!<br /><br />I also have the chocolate and they are very good, but this is my favorite<br /><br />Enjoy, I do."
1,"I've long since been a Nature Valley fan and regularly buy a variety pack at one of my local 'big box' stores but, the price I could get by utilizing the 'subscribe and save' feature was, by far, superior to that of the big box.  They arrived fresh, in date, and 'in tact'.  I must say, I was a bit worried that they'd be granular granola by the time they were shipped/handled but, that simply didn't occur.  Two thumbs up!"
1,"I can't find these in the grocery store! My family loves these, so I will continue to buy them on Amazon."
1,"I love these bars, tasty, quick and easy.  I have one of these everyday for my breakfast on the go.  They're not the sweet, sticky, candy bar type granola bars you may have tried.  It's more like a freeze dried type bar.  Mild flavor with enough substance to get me through till lunch.  I've tried them all, but apple is my favorite."
1,"Has a nice apple & cinnamon flavor!!<br /><br />Previous reviewer did not read the description, as it states the bars are in two-packs, and the bars are crunchy.  I break the bars into three pieces before opening the pack, makes it easier to eat.<br /><br />This is one of the harder to find flavors of Nature Valley Granola Bars.  Most of the time you'll see the Oats N Honey, Peanut Butter, and Maple as the only flavors stocked in stores.  I was lucky to find a local grocery which sells these, in addition to the Pecan flavor."
1,"When I went looking for the Nut Roasted crunchy bars, I ran across this flavor ""Apply Crisp"". They do not disappoint. Tastes great. In order to get a discount, I had to order 6 boxes. I gave it my best to finish all 60 bars but ran out of steam, so I've been putting them to good use. I hand them out to the homeless. A small token of assistance from me to them."
1,"As a college kid(in a masters program) I appreciate these little bars. They go for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Really awesome taste with milk. I wish they were sold without the plastic packaging(that would be cheaper), or as granola cereal."
1,My kids really like this one. Just wish Amazon would sell assortments so you don't have to buy so many of each flavor.
1,"Good Buy for the price. Great with the morning coffee. This is the brittle kind, but this is perfect as a breakfast substitute. I always have a box or two in my office desk. Good buy...and healthy !"
1,"Ever since I had my first Nature Valley Granola Bar I have never purchased any other brand. I love the fact that they are so crunchy. (My husband likes chewy ones, and he buys his and I buy mine). I always have some in my car in case I get hungry. That way there is no temptation to go to a drive thru for fast food! I have never seen this APPLE flavor before, and I could hardly wait to get the box from AMAZON open. There is NO flavor of NV granola bars I don't like, but this flavor became my instant second ""favorite"" (after Peanut Butter). When I eat these in the car I break the package in thirds cross wise (breaking BOTH of the bars), then I go back and break each to those sections in half lengthwise of the package. Then I split the package open the length of its seam and put it where I can reach it. By doing this I generally get 12 fairly uniform pieces and very few crumbs (which I eat later when the car is not moving). This method works well anywhere you want to eat them and definitely seems to generate far fewer crumbs.<br />I ORDERED THESE AS A SUBSCRIPTION JUST BASED ON HOW GOOD ALL THE OTHER FLAVORS OF NATURE VALLEY ARE.<br />NOTE: Another flavor I have never heard of: Vanilla Nut is listed on Amazon as ""out of stock"" with a place you can sign up to be notified when they are again in stock. They've been rated very well by past Amazon Purchasers so I am waiting with a dripping tongue (my dogs taught me that)."
1,"Excellent taste and value.  Quick easy order and mailed to my daughter. This flavor of bar is hard to find in grocery stores in the USA.  She loved them, too.  Thanks.  Ardie in AZ"
1,Not too sugary and the apple flavor is a plus. I leave a bar or two in my backpack as an emergency snack during school. It doesn't crumble too easily as long as it's not tossed around or crushed.
1,"I absolutely love these. Great to know I'm getting whole grains, and the taste is lovely. Not quite like biting into an actual apple crisp, but darn good just the same! I only wish they had less calories; but then again, I wish that on every food."
1,"Very handy food suplement for hiking or just whatever. The flavor of these is excellent. Just the right amount of sweet, with a slight buttery apple taste."
1,We love apple crisp and are most distressed that Nature Valley quit making them. Please keep them in your stock as long as possible. Thanks
1,My husband likes the crunchy granola bars to dunk in coffee and these fit the bill. The only drawback is that we had to order what amounts to 72 packages of bars! It's a good thing he likes them! I wish it had been a little easier to customize for a variety pack.
1,I have only recently tried cooking Chinese at home.  I have served Kung Pao Chicken made with this sauce to rave reviews.  There are fights over the leftovers!
1,"Good prices at JVS, considering the fact that if you order from one of the other Asian sites, you will pay on average about 12 dollars for shipping. So, JVS is a dollar or two cheaper. This is good authentic sauce."
1,I bought this as a gift for my rich bitchy grandma. And she loved it. She said the cheese and crackers were great the thing was to damn cute I wished i would have gotten myself one. I bought a bunch of hickory farms stuff for my other family this was the only thing that everyone thanked me on. It's good for one or two people.
1,My wife and I has been drinking folger half and half for some time now. We enjoy the great taste. I shop between amazon and walmart for out coffee.
1,This is a great tasting product that also came in a very appreciated packagin. I do thank you guys. I will order more when I am running out. No biggie. You all hae a good day. Later.<br /><br />G.
1,This is a delicious sauce that my entire family loves.  We can't get enough of it.
1,This is a delicious product.I have made roasted barley tea from scratch.This is much easier and same delicious taste.I will buy this product again.Nice packaging and large quantity.
1,"I absolutely adore this tea, especially in the summer.  It is very refreshing and caffine free.  This is a nice large package to get you through the season since 1 bag makes about a gallon of ice tea.  The service and shipping was fast...but I didn't get a free pack of Meiji Mini Candy with my order of 2 bags."
1,I love mugicha and am disappointed that it's so hard to find.  It's great for our kids too -- a healthful alternative to sugary drinks.  My  former Japanese teacher said children and pregnant women in Japan drink it all the time.
1,"The idea of boiling grain to make a tea never occurred to me.  Surprisingly in Seoul, many restaurants serve barley tea, called bori-cha as their standard free beverage.  Most of my Korean colleagues love it.  It is a kind of cultural icon.  Growing up with Honey nut Cheerios, I assumed that barley needs honey, so I added honey to my barley tea and it is to die for.  My Korean colleagues consider this sacrilege, but I still recommend it.<br /><br />Barley tea is also popular in Japan and Ecuador.  Apparently, we are behind in the discovery of this wonderful tea.<br /><br />The taste of barley tea is a bit like regular tea, say Lipton, but softer.  Most importantly for me, this tea is healthy and natural.  I don't drink coffee, black or green tea for health and personal reasons.  Tea made from barley is healthy, refreshing and enjoyable.  You must try some."
0,This tea was a disappointment. The tea had a weak barley flavor no matter how many tea bags were used. I do not believe this tea was very fresh. I will try another variety.
1,"I spent last summer in Japan, and recently found myself missing the refreshing taste of barley tea.  The tea tastes exactly as I remembered. I dropped a single bag in a liter of water and left it in the fridge for two hours, and there was my tea.<br /><br />The smell of the tea bags pre-tea is a bit offputting, but it's well worth putting up with for the tea.<br /><br />Also, the bags are not for individual cups, but for pots or pitchers. This is what I wanted, but make sure you aren't expecting smaller tea-bags made for individual cups.<br /><br />Also, good deal for the price in my opinion."
1,"Mugicha is so delicious, especially when ice cold.  It really quenches thirst and has a nice, slightly astringent flavor.  It was the first thing I consumed when I first went to Asia, specifically Korea.  I drank it a lot in Japan too.  The Japanese drink it mostly in the summer but I like it year round.  Enjoy a glass today.  Oh, and it is so simple to make, just put a bag in a big jug and add cold water and put in the fridge, it is ready in 2 hours.  So easy!"
0,"I really enjoy the natural decaf property of barley tea. I normally use whole barley at home but needed bags for the office. I had brought some back from China on my last trip that I could not find in the US, so I tried this brand. These large bags are actually for a teapot, not a cup as I expected. As mentioned, the flavor was not full-bodied and so I will keep searching."
0,"I first began using the roasted barley to make a beverage almost thirty years ago while learning Hapkido. It is good for the heart, stabilizes the pancreas, and works as a fat emulsifier. It goes well with roasted corn to make an even more healthful drink. I would suggest buying it from a local Korean, Chinese or Japanese market. I just got 4  bags of roasted corn and the roasted barley for less than $9. Then you can either brew it whole on the stove, or grind it and brew it in a French Press. Both ways work well. Adding sugar or honey diminishes some of the health benefits. In spring and summer I have it at room temperature. If it is cold outside I drink it warm. Either way is great. Try 4 tablespoons to a quart of water."
1,"I had a craving for this while I was pregnant, and ate it almost every day. Th flavor is excellent, and true to the directions, it only takes 12 minutes to make. Use a nonstick pan, and keep it on a full boil just like it says. Worth every penny! You won't be dissapointed!"
1,"The label says that you can make this risotto in 12 minutes. It took me about 35, and there was still a bit more liquid than I would like; I finally decided to just let it sit on the cooling burner to absorb the last bit of liquid.<br /><br />The flavor, however, is excellent. Cheesy, but not overpoweringly so. I'd definitely order it again."
1,"I love this product, and everyone must too, because the prices are going up. I now use it sparingly. More for a treat. That is what I ask for Christmas every year. I hope I get it this yr. 8)"
0,"If you want to pay a lot for sugar, then buy this box of sugar. No Kiwi was hurt in the production of this so called Kiwi Smoothie, because it does have any Kiwi in it."
1,I LOVE THIS CHUNKY VEGETABLE BEEF SOUP BECAUSE IT IS GREAT TASTE. I LIKE THIS SOUP. I ENJOY EAT IT.
1,"My 3 dogs love this food. I mix it with a small amount of dry dog food that is also very healthy (no grains). All three push their bowls around the kitchen floor licking up every small bit they have left and then lick the other dogs bowls just to make sure they haven't missed anything. A very healthy food and if it looks that good to you, you could eat some too. It's made in a facility that also makes ""human"" food so it wouldn't hurt you if you were very hungry and had nothing else to eat."
1,"I just used my new wok to make a stir fry, and took a gamble on this Hoisin. I usually use one from an Asian foods store. WOW, What have I been missing all this time!!?! Dynasty brand is so much better, deeper, and well...less weird than the type I was using. I didn't even know what I was using was that bad, I enjoyed it until I tried Dynasty. Now I'll never go back.<br /><br />It has that earthy, rich flavor that you can never quite identify when you go to a Chinese restaurant. I used to think I just needed to add more soy sauce to make my stir fry or beef and broccoli taste like it does when I get takeout. No. It's the hoisin!! You don't need much, but this will bring out that depth and richness you want in a sauce, thick or thin, to really taste wonderful.<br /><br />Personally, I used a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies (I know, life is short, frozen is okay sometimes!) and a handful of shrimp and a block of tofu cut up. I added about 1/3 c soy sauce (kikkoman, of course!!) and a dash, probably a 1/4 teaspoon or so of Dynasty Hoisin, mixed well and DANG! That was so good!!! If you like a lot of sauce you could totally double or triple it, adding hoisin to taste. I also added about 1/8th teaspoon oyster sauce, another one of those ""Why is this beef and broccoli so good??"" items, but you could leave that out.  Also, you could add cashews and sub chicken for shrimp and make cashew chicken! Yum! Enjoy!"
0,"Ok.  I've been making a lot of Vietnamese spring rolls at home with peanut sauce; they're surprisingly really easy, but I need a lot of Hoisin to make the peanut sauce.  Ran out of real Hoisin Sauce, and because I didn't have the time to go to the local Asian market, I took a chance with Dynasty (got it at Wal-mart).  The best thing I can say about the Dynasty Hoisin Sauce is that it's a small bottle, so I didn't feel too bad throwing it in the trash.  IT IS REALLY BAD!  There's no way anyone who likes to eat yummy food could possibly rate this sauce over 1 star.  I would give it negative stars if I could because I find it offensive to eat food that tastes so wrong.  I'm completely baffled by the 5 star reviews.  TIA?  Stroke?  Alzheimer's?  Tumor?  There's got to be a reason beyond just not knowing any better.  In my humble opinion, Koon Chun hoisin is the gold standard."
1,Hard to find Hoisin Sauce at my local supermarkets here in this small town. This is a good product at a good price. Hard to believe that Amazon can sell and ship these for just over $10...but they did!  Packaged really well.  Use this for creating that authentic Chinese BBQ food taste for ribs and pork.
1,"Our 3 English Setters prefer these dog treats to anything else (except meat). I read the ingredients and researched it a bit and then took a bite of one myself. Yum!!! Frankly, I could eat the whole box myself. These are a winner. Not as sweet as human cookies and full of wonderful flavor, tender crunchy. I approve!"
1,"Every morning she has to have one. If I gave her one all day, I'd be buying these every week. She plays with it. It's so cute. I throw it down the hall, she goes running after it, then jumps all around it. I used to chase her like to try and get it from her, but she got too impatient for that. Soon as I throw it now, she eats it. Also a good hiding spot for liquid medicine or pills you can crush."
0,"i received a different brand: brown color Anateon something like that. that brand is not great, all stuck together. i dont know if the picture showed is different brand. it's worth it!"
1,"Don't get me wrong, these pistachios are fantastic.  Though, it's something that I've never thought of... but these nuts are not salted.  Antep pistachios are great, but when you take away the salt, they're just not as addictive.  I'm still going to eat them, I just won't horde them all to myself like I used to.  From now on, make sure you order your turkish pistachios with salt.  It makes all the difference in the world."
1,I purchased these pistachios as a present for my husband.  he loves Turkish pistachios and we can't get them here in rural Maine. These nuts are fresh and exactly what he wanted. The price per pound works out the best I could find.
1,"I like this cereal over all the other ones out there, so I gave it 5 stars.  You pick up the box and can just tell it has more substance to it.  A lot of cereals show plenty of fruit and nuts on the picture on the outside of the box, but then the actual cereal has very litte.  This Quaker cereal is different and I hope they don't cheapen it over time like the others are doing.<br />But $21 for a 56 ounce box????  Are they out of their mind??!!  One 28 oz box cost $4.50 in the grocery store, so 56 oz would cost $9.  Where do they get off charging $12 more is a mystery to me.  Unless I'm reading this incorrectly, and they are selling several 56 oz boxes for $21.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/1/2012: I see they have reduced the price from $21 to $11.24.  But it's still not $9 like it would be at the store, and what would shipping add to it?"
1,excellent salame - it is a luxury product that will make you throw rocks at ordinary dry salami.  I will order it for my next special occaision.
0,"This salami is not what I am used to when I buy Genoa salami.  Too much fat, great lumps of fat in the meat which I took out one at a time before eating what was left.  Very greasy.  Threw it all away in disgust.  Would not recommend to my friends."
1,"Finn Crisp Multigrain are very tasty very thin ""crackers"" each 1 5/8 x 4 3/4.  Finn Crisp are wonderful with melted cheese (about 20 seconds in a microwave).  They can be used anyway you'd use crackers, with the benefit that they are less fragile, less likely to spontaneous disintegrate with the first bite---so Finn Crisp are actually better than crackers for dips and spreads and such.  In fact, a very tasty, very healthy snack (if you aren't counting every calorie) is simply a thin layer of mayo on a Finn Crisp.<br /><br />I suppose Finn Crisp are healthy, a good source of fiber, with minimal processing, no preservatives, and such.  However, Finn Crisp are simply my favorite crackers.<br /><br />OTHER VARIETIES<br />Multigrain Finn Crisp have a mild neutral flavor, excellent with very delicate cheese.  Finn Crips original has a slightly sour flavor, like (unseeded) rye, pumpernickle or sour dough bread.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JJK0B6"">Finn Crisp Original, Delicately Thin Rye Crispbread, 7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 9)</a> If you like the flavor of seeded rye bread (i.e., with caraway seeds) try the Caraway version (my favorate).  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JJHSPW"">Finn Crisp Caraway Thin Rye Crispbread with Caraway, 6.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 9)</a><br /><br />PRICE<br />$26 for a pack of 9 (or $21 if you sign up for a periodic shipment subscription) direct from Amazon is a fair price.  However, when Amazon is out-of-stock, I've seen the price as high as $42, which is excessive.<br /><br />Recommendation:  After major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your reciept, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon.  When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid.  Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it."
1,"After having gastric bypass, I find that I really miss the ""crunch"" of crackers. After looking for a good whole grain cracker with low or no sugar, and low in carbs, I stumbled across this cracker and decided to try it. I AM SOLD!! This cracker is just what the right cracker. Its made of all healthy ingredients, all good grains. Yes it has carbs, but they are healthy carbs and only 10 grams for 2 crackers, which are good size cracker. I will eat 2 or 3 crackers with cheese or tuna, or sometimes peanut butter (for the protein) and I am full.<br /><br />I took the package to my doctor, and he said it was a good healthy cracker. Its great for anyone with diabetes too!!I now order them by the case from amazon. I am glad to find this cracker and its now the only one I will eat."
1,"I always loved the Finn Crisp Rye w/o Caraway Seeds, but I had to order the Multigrain b/c they were out of the rye ones. Now I've got some of the rye again and I realize--I love the Multigrain! Maybe they changed the recipe for the rye ones--they're almost like sawdust when you chew them. The Multigrain ones are so yummy--you can just grab a couple and munch on them for a snack. They have a very slightly sweet taste, like whole grain products often do, but they go well with everything. My favorite thing to top them with is plain cream cheese with salt and pepper. If you like healthy foods and want an easy way to be good to your diet, buy these!"
1,A healthy snack option.Such as great taste!You should definitely have the courage to try it.I'm eating one while writing this...
1,"I have known and enjoyed Finn Cisp for almost three decades, because I was able to buy it in Germany. I now live in AZ and was not able to buy it here.<br />I was so glad to learn that I could order through Amazon.com. I love the product because of its taste and it's low calory and fat content. My whole family and many of our friends love it too. I now order it through Amazon's subscription thereby taking advantage of lower prices  and free shipping.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JJHSQG"">Finn Crisp Multigrain Thin Crisp, 6.2 Oz Boxes (Pack of 9)</a>"
1,"The wholegrain rye with caraway taste great. These were served at the Finn Embassy in D.C. at recent open house and they are great eaten plain or with a bit of topping. Also try with quark, sardines or salmon."
1,"I first had this bouillon in Switzerland and LOVED it and brought some home with me.  It is hands down the best vegetable bouillon - adds so much flavor to soups, vegetables and dips etc.  It is organic  too- Yea! I was thrilled to see that Amazon carries it!  I am about to order a case now.  Thank you Amazon!"
1,"When visiting a friend in London last month, she strongly encouraged me to try this broth. Wow, it was delicious. I bought a can and wish I would have bought more! I've been sipping cups of it and just can't get enough of it. It is very flavorful, easy to dissolve, and has a pure, natural taste. It is fantastic - I highly recommend it!"
1,"Hey, this stuff is great!  Just a teaspoon in a cup of hot water is marvelous.  This is not your Mom's much-too-salty old foil wrapped bouillon cube.  Every kitchen needs some Marigold Bouillon Powder.  I chose the reduced-salt product and I was a bit skeptical that I would be able to use 6 containers, but that's how they were packaged.  Now that I've tried it, there's no question I'll use them all and be reordering very soon."
1,This bouillon is great and VHTF. I love the low sodium version. Please add it to your inventory. Thank  you.
0,"but it isn't very flavorful.  a friend suggested it and i jumped on it when amazon got it back in stock.  i do like that it is made with vegetable products but i won't buy it again.  shoot, i have enough for the next ten years!"
1,I use this exclusively to make spaghetti sauce.  It's also excellent when i want an Italian theme for pork or chicken dishes.
1,My husband is English and drinks a LOT of tea. PG Tips is his and my favorite. so happy to find it on Amazon at such a good price.
1,I believe this is one of the best deals to buy PG Tips in bulk.  My package arrived on time in good condition.  I'm pleased with the product and service.
0,"I was expecting a lot form England's No 1 tea. If you like the Black tea Lipton tea bags then you may like this product. I find this one very bland, mild, no taste, no color. The tea in the bags is like powder."
1,Syrup of Cassis is hard to find.  Most people settle for Creme de Cassis which is alcohol based.  But the non- alcoholic syrup doesn't overwhelm the wine.
1,I lived in France for over a year and used this to make kir and kir royal.  I was very excited to see that it was for sale and the same product you can get overseas.
1,"This is legitimate cassis, just like in France.  It is definitely worth buying, except for the price.  The price Amazon is selling this for is a bit high."
1,"Great tasting coffee - goes well with entrees as well as dessert.  I easily tasted nutmeg, cloves, allspice, and just a hint of cinnamon.  I will definitely purchase this again.<br /><br />My only regret is that it apparently does not come in whole bean; however, the ground was very fresh."
0,"This was not as strongly flavored as I was hoping, If you want something with only a HINT of spice than this is for you. I had to end up adding a tbls of pumpkin pie spice to the coffee filter when I brewed a cup. The was a total wast of money & time"
1,I am enjoying this coffee. It's a well balanced and yet subtle blend. Trader Joe's ran out of their pumpkin spice coffee - this isn't as strongly spiced but is a pleasant substitute.
1,Good pumpkin spice flavor. Just pay attention to the size 10oz bag. So its not cheap. But its an affordable way to refill your own kcups.  Kcups prices are ridiculous.
1,My cat is on this special diet. Works great...she has been UTI free for over a year. But I can purchase this from my vet for about $47 for a 17.6 pound bag. So before purchasing here shop around...I have also found other websites that sale for $60 or less.
0,This basket was absolutely not worth the $40.00 that it cost. I was humiliated when my boss opened it. There were also items missing from the basket. It was quite tacky.
0,"The items in this basket collectively are worth about $10. Not quite sure what I was expecting when I bought this. The gloves are something out of the 70's, gummi worms (50 cents?), stale cookies ($1?), seeds ($3 on Amazon!), and some tea (~$5?). This is way overpriced for what was delivered."
1,This is a great gift. I was looking for something different for my wife for Mother's Day. This was perfect. Shipment was very fast. I've never been disappointed with anything I've purchased from Amazon.
1,"Not going to say much since I never got to see the actual product, but I had it delivered to my mom for mother's day while I was outside America.<br /><br />She seems to like it!"
1,My family and I thoroughly enjoyed the quinoa. The shipment arrived as described and in a nice sturdy container. There will be many future orders.
1,We have 2 labradors and these are the best chew toys.  Box of 90 bones last 4-5 months.  This is great.  It takes them 1-2 hours to finish.  Can keep them busy if they chew a few minutes at a time.
1,"I have two medium size dogs that love to chew and these rawhides are awesome!  The 6"" bones last a few hours which is a few hours of serenity for us!"
1,"My dog loves these rawhide bones. He's a black lab mix and it takes him a an hour and a half of pure chewing to get through one. You can tell that the bones are quality rawhide and thoroughly pressed (always a plus!)<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was that each bone had a tag. A small issue, but only takes two seconds to take all of them off. (Just silly to waste paper I guess.)<br /><br />In total, these bones are worth it and will not break into little pieces on the floor. I will certainly buy these again in the future!"
1,Great price on these pressed bones.<br />My dogs love em! The bones arrived<br />within a couple of days and were in<br />great shape. Will be ordering more!
1,"My dogs love these, i been buying these at my local pet store. Buying these in bulk is saving me a ton of money. Shipping was super fast."
1,"I have a friend with two Bull Mastifs and they love a good rawhide chew!  Finding these chews in bulk, at a reasonable price is difficult at times. A quick search on Amazon, revealed exactly what I was looking for. Good value for the money. Shipping was fast and as stated."
0,"Don't feed Rawhides, they are unhealthy.<br />Sadly, rawhide bones are very dangerous to dogs. While some dogs go their entire lives scarfing down the fun-to-chew treats, they can be deadly. Rawhides can be full of bacteria and poisons. Aside from what is in rawhide, dogs can choke on them or sustain intestinal blockage from ingesting them.<br /><br />Rawhides often come from less developed countries. This means that the hides are transported over poor roads and without refrigeration, before they cleaned and dried. Under these conditions, they can grow salmonella which can kill your dog. It is also unsafe for humans, especially small children, to handle. The problem has been so serious that in 1999 the FDA to issued a warning on the subject stating ""These products may pose a risk of bacterial infection such as Salmonella...FDA is urging pet owners who have these products to handle them carefully. Anyone who comes in contact with these treats should wash their hands with hot water and soap. Elderly people, young children, and people with weakened immune systems are particularly at risk from exposure and should avoid any contact with these chews.""<br /><br />Read up."
1,"I bought this to make a cornbread recipe. Coconut flour and cornmeal makes a cornbread where you don't know if it is a cake or a bread, you only know you want more of it. It is a recommended item for those wanting less wheat in their diet.  Trying coconut flour recipes is a total delight."
1,"I like the natural sweetness and high fiber content of this flour. I am using it in gluten free recipes in place of sweet brown rice flour, until I can purchase that.  So far the cookies made with it have come out well. It's also great to use in pancakes.  The key is only to use a little of the flour. Too much c. flour in any recipe probably won't have the results you would prefer."
1,"This is a wonderful flour to use. low carbs, and full of nutrients. I dont use it though because it has a very strong sweet coconuty flavor and I am not a coconut kind of person. If I DO add it, it is a minute amount. But defintiely number one flour to buy and use..even for baking for your doggie cookies. I only gave it 4 stars cause of the taste."
0,How does $ 8.99 for 16 oz....calculate out to 12 cents an ounce? this marketing doesn't make a bit of sense. My math says this is 57 cents an ounce. What gives?
1,Needed some flour to make muffins for a friend who has celiac disease.  This fit the bill!  Bob's can always be trusted to have a good product at a good price.
1,"This Kenyan tea is very smooth and malty. A four minute steep gives a rich,satisfying cup of tea. Excellent with sweetener (Stevia)and a shot of half and half. One of my top 3 breakfast teas."
1,This is the only stuff I can count on when ever I'm out playing sports it nevers slow me down. I can drink as much as I can and not even go to the bathroom for a while.
1,"Easily the best cereal on the market, Kashi: Good Friends Cereal is the perfect blend of crunchiness, flavor, fiber, and protein, without a cloying sweetness. Pretty much everything you'd want in a cereal. I'm also a big fan of Good Friends: Cinna-Raisin Crunch. My only question: Who's friends with whom? Is it the cereal barrels that are good friends with the cereal twigs? Or is it me, am I good friends with the cereal itself?"
1,"Fat Cat makes the most imaginative toys for cats. They entertain me as well! The cat nip in the toy is an attraction to the cats as well as the feathered tickle ones, making my indoor cats feel like they are hunters. They even make my floor look cute when it is cluttered with cat toys!"
1,"My cat loves these lures, especially the one with the red fuzzy hair.  I only wish the fishing pole itself lasted as long.  Oh well."
1,Both of my cats like these and they are cute too.  I stick them in catnip.
0,I bought these extra lures for the broken cat toy that I purchased with these. My cat likes the fluffy hair on the one butterfly character but once he ripped it all out the fun was over. ...meh.
1,"I discovered this product at Whole Foods when I was looking for a supplement for my kids. The 10 year old has Asperger's Syndrome and can be very picky about his fruits and veggies, and the toddler has pretty typical capricious tastes so it's sometimes a challenge to find foods they both will eat.  I've been fixing this in smoothies for them (bannanas, pineapple, strawberries, 2% milk, and crushed ice) and they LOVE it!! 2 scoops of the supplement works well for both. Great product!"
1,My 2 year old sons loves this powder.  He actually takes it with water vs. juice.  I am happy to know my picky eater is able to get his vitamins for the day.
1,"This works well as a smoothie supplement for my kids, or mixed with orange juice. They weren't ""sippin' the Kool-Aid"" though, when I mixed it with water."
1,"I had all kind of trouble with my enlarged prostate. Even Mayo clinic Docs advised for surgery. I tried pumpkin seeds and then went to this oil taking one table spoon in the AM, another in the PM. I tangibly improved and have decided not to do the surgery. I do not need it. This oil is like a magic food for the prostate. I was told it is very good for libido, but I am content just to be able to urinate normally :-)<br /><br />The taste is absolutely genius. This is the best discovery for me on Amazon thus far as it changed my health and helped cope."
1,"I had tried this product at a friends for a lunch salad. It was so delicious I couldn't wait to get home and see if I could find it on line. I really appreciated the no shipping charge. It arrived last night and it was just as good as I remember, so happy I found it. I will buy it again. Try it for a change."
1,"I used this oil as the fat for homemade pie crust, as well as adding 2-4 tablespoons to pumpkin pie batter for additional richness, and a deeper pumpkin flavor!  Its awesome, and adds a unique color to the crust."
1,"My sister-in-law introduced me to this oil, which is sold at our local farmer's market. It adds a nutty deliciousness to salads, soups (like carrot or squash soup) and green vegetable smoothies. Highly recommend this product"
1,"I only learned about toasted pumpkin seed oil recently, but it has already become a favorite food. I have tried other brands, but this is the best so far. It has a complex aroma of toasted nuts, and goes as well with oatmeal or vanilla ice cream as with a salad. A word of caution: this oil is fragile, and needs to be stored in the refrigerator after opening to preserve its flavors and aromas."
1,"This arrived yesterday and so far I've only tried it once, which made a great dressing for watercress and cabbage.  When you bite into the dressed salad, there is a brief moment when you can taste the pumpkin flavor.<br /><br />The bottles are very tiny, and the plastic seal which you pull to open seems secure.  There was no leakage.<br /><br />The oil is a very dark greenish/reddish color.  I know it sounds like an implausible combination of colors, but that's what it looked like to me.<br /><br />Looking forward to trying the suggestion of drizzling it on ice cream.  Look forward to using this oil with other foods and in other ways.<br /><br />It's nice we can order these from amazon as the local Whole Foods only has the walnut oil and pecan oil from this brand, but does not carry the pumpkin seed oil.<br /><br />I might try this brand's walnut oil next, as it is significantly cheaper than the pumpkin seed oil."
1,"The oil is quite tasty, though not quite as strong as some of the pumpkin seed oil that I ate when I lived in Austria. The price is much better than some of the others, especially when using subscribe and save. I love this on salads with balsamic vinegar."
1,"The product is fresh  and well packed. Very good for use as a oil for  salads. While making them tasty, it is very good for health too!"
1,I like dried papaya and this brand is some of the best I've tried.  Good price too.
1,I bought this for my three parrots and my consumption.  It has a very good taste and a good price.  Papaya has a lot of Vitamin A which is good for birds and humans.
1,"These are good, nice cheese flavor. If your out of croutons break up afew for your salad, or float them in onion soup. Pretty Good!"
0,"I found these cheese snacks just terrible.... they smell like dog treats and taste like, what i would imagine... dog treats to taste like.. I whole-heartedly implore you to avoid these snacks."
0,"I like white cheddar.  I can eat half a pound of it at one sitting.  I like soy.  I can chug plain varieties of it by the quart.<br /><br />But 'Just the Cheese Rounds, Cheddar Plus Soy' as a snack?  It's hard to get down one of these calcified nuggets, let alone a portion.<br /><br />As an added bonus, an aftertaste will naturally curb your appetite for hours."
1,Peanut oil is good for baking and frying. It does not have an odor in baking and it does not easily burn at high temperatures when frying. I am just a regular house wife who likes to cook. Peanut oil does not make my house stink. I used to be afraid of frying because of the smell but that has changed. I am more willing to fry now. I tried to find peanut oil in regular grocery stores but couln't. Costco used to carry it but not any more. I ordered through Amazon.com and I am very happy with the purchase.
0,"This is a GREAT product.  Use it all the time, but don't buy it here for $168!!!!  You can get it elsewhere, including Sam's Club, for less than $35.  Same size, same company, same everything for way less than half the price!!!!"
0,"Like a lot of people, I guess, I got scared of chicken jerky made in China. Even though I used a very respectable brand that's sold broadly in every major chain (Dogswell), I still felt a little queasy. So I bought this stuff, which is made in Colorado. Colorado! What better state for dogs than Colorado? Great terrain changes, fresh air, active residents--boy, was this jerky gonna be great. Only it wasn't. It was rock-hard. My Havanese are 15 and 18 pounds, so there's no way they're getting a whole strip; i break off pieces. I cannot do so with this product, except to break a strip in half. The only reason this product didn't get one star is that my dogs seem to like whatever bite-sized pieces I'm able to create by using a hammer."
1,"Another Cristmas present for the lady of the house. She just told me that it's some of the most excellent tea she's had. Too bad we can't buy this in the stores around here. Ah well, we will keep purchasing it from AMAZON until it comes this way."
1,"We are from the UK and we cannot but these peas here in USA, Thank God this seller has them. We but 8 at a time and will continue to do so as long as they sell them. Bigger than your average pea, the water inside is slightly flavoured with mint. A real treat."
1,"When I saw this soup on the shelf at the store, I was immediately interested. I love Thai food. The flavor is nice without being overwhelming. I find no need to add any additional spices or seasoning. A nice soup for a rainy day like today. Warm and comforting."
0,"I've NEVER seen such small cans of Chunky Soup. You know, Campbell's Chunky soup has been sold since the 1970s and in that time I've seen only one size of can. This is not the usual double but a SINGLE SERVING CAN! If you think you're getting a good deal, THINK AGAIN and compare the can size."
0,I've been noticing recently that this and all their chunky soups are becoming more and more watered down.<br /><br />That and the incremental downsizing of their products(as with just about everything else in the grocery store) means I'll be passing their section of the soup aisle. Time to make my own I guess.
0,"Every single can of soup in my order was dented. Not just slightly, but as if someone had taken each can and personally threw it on the cement before they shipped it to me."
0,It is my own fault that I didn't realize I always buy the 18.8 ounce and this is only 10.75 ounce cans. (I've never even seen them in this small of a size). I only buy them on sale so the price per can for the 10.75 ounce is more than I normally buy the 18.8 ounce for.  Amazon will not allow you to return food even though this is cans and was still in the plastic wrap.
1,"Price is too high compared to the 18.6 oz cans.  At 18.6 oz can price a case of 12 of the smaller 10.75 oz cans should only cost $12.11 if the 18.6 oz cost $20.96 for a case of 12.  That is .02 cents per ounce more, buying it by the smaller cans.<br />I purchased a few cases of the smaller cans when they were on sale, then seen the 18.6 oz cans were cheaper by the ounce and bought four cases of them to try.<br /><br />WOW, was I SURPRISED. I have gone back to eating the smaller cans of the soup. The flavor in the bigger cans does NOT even come close to tasting the same as the soup in the smaller cans.  Why that is I have no idea. But I find the flavor of the smaller cans MUCH more flavorful and tasty vs the larger cans.  If the larger cans contained soup that tasted the same, I would purchase the larger cans every time.  But all 48 cans in the four cases tasted the same.  Something just not quite right with the flavor.<br /><br />Personal preference I am sure, but that is part of life.  I grabbed the salt and pepper mills and added a little of each to the big cans of soup.  Nope, I couldn't make it taste as good as the soup in the smaller cans, no matter how I dressed it up.  The smaller cans needed no salt or pepper, and the flavor was/is perfect, thus I bought seven cases of the smaller cans in the past three months.<br /><br />I would give it five stars, but doc it one star because of the high price.  And, yes, sometimes some of the cans are dented, but I think most of these cans, which they sell for about half of what you pay in a grocery store for them, are distressed goods. e.g. Picked up from grocery stores because they ARE dented.  A dent doesn't bother me since I am only paying about half price per can and getting it delivered for free.  Campbell's large cans of rib roast are great flavor, but that is another story/review.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V6FTZO"">Campbells Chunky Soup, Classic Chicken Noodle, 10.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>"
1,"For ""canned"" soup, this actually tastes pretty good and I am VERY particular. So for me to say that, it's saying a lot. If I had to rate this out of all the canned soups I've eaten in my life, 10 being best, I'd give this a 7.<br /><br />I add hot sauce and salt to mine, plus I eat it with Lay's Spicy Cayenne & Cheese chips. It gives the meal a crunch to it, which makes me feel like I'm really eating. Otherwise, it's just mush.<br /><br />I actually LIKE the smaller size because I can't finish the larger cans. It's perfect for how much I want to eat. Most portions are too big and too much food for one sitting."
0,These cans wound up being about $1.83 a can. And they're not even a full can of soup. I should have read the size closer- but this is almost like scamming. Not right to do to customers!!!!
1,"It was a bit of a surprise to see how poor the reviews of this soup are. In terms of taste and texture, this chicken noodle soup is very close to the 18-ounce Healthy Choice Chunky chicken soup that Amazon also sells. And that gets five-star ratings from reviewers.<br /><br />This soup has a fairly rich and tangy chicken broth. The noodles are substantial and just about as good as canned noodles can possibly be. There are chunks of white chicken meat in the soup. There is also a hint of other vegetables (carrots, I think) in the broth. The Healthy Choice version of this soup is actually a bit more bland than this soup because the use of salt is minimized. The 10-ounce size of the can makes this an ideal choice for a quick snack, whereas the 18-ounce Chunky soups are a bit too large as a snack for one person.<br /><br />So what's not to like? The negative reviews seem to focus on three things: the soup is watery, the cans are too small, and the price is too high. Let me take these in turn:<br /><br />1. The Chunky soup line is not condensed soup. I know from other reviews that some people think it is, add water, and then complain that the soup tastes watery. This soup actually has an appropriate amount of broth as it is. That broth is fragrant and has a distinctive chicken-y taste. If you add water, though, it will taste watery.<br /><br />2. The cans are exactly as big as Amazon claims. I know some people buy this expecting the big Chunky soup cans sold in supermarkets, and these people understandably feel disappointed. I had to learn myself to be careful and check the quantity or volume with any online grocery purchases.  But as I said above, the 20-ounce cans are ideal for quick snacks. I knew I was buying something in smaller cans, and I personally found this size preferable.<br /><br />3. The soup right now is in fact overpriced at $22. The Healthy Choice 12-pack of 18-ounce chicken noodle soup costs less, around the $18-19 range. That's a much better deal. When I got this particular item from Amazon, I paid about $13. The soup is a good deal at that price. Any higher, and it's a poor deal.<br /><br />By the way, I add Parmesan cheese and baco-bits to this soup. It makes for a more entertaining treat. I hope some of this proves helpful."
1,"Ten Ren has different grades of oolong tea, but for me since I drink oolong tea a lot, I purchased this since this was very affordable.<br />The grade is of course not high, but for everyday use, this is great."
1,"This is an excellent price for high-quality, organic, Grade B, Kosher maple syrup. It is 100% maple syrup, with no other additives. It is certified Kosher by KOF-K and is organically grown in New England. Grade B maple syrup is excellent for pouring on waffles or pancakes and is also tasty added to baked goods. It has a deeper, richer flavor than dark, medium or light grade A syrup.<br /><br />I highly recommend the seller, Swanson, whom I've had frequent dealings with. They have a large website and sell a wide variety of health products, both supplements and health foods like this syrup. They have always processed my orders on their website quickly, and the orders have arrived promptly, with no delivery problems."
1,I have so far ordered three of this syrup .tastes yummy. delivery is very prompt and its the cheapest i could find anywhere. will recommend to go for it.
1,I purchased the syrup in order to fulfill the requirements of the Master Cleanse.  The cleanse is done at a minimum of 10 days which is how long I chose to do it.  The determining factor in my purchase of Now 640z Grade B maple syrup was the price!  $28.00 for a 640z bottle of Pure (Grade B) Maple Syrup is awesome!  It was shipped & received very quickly which made me even more satisfied!  Thanks Amazon for being on top of your business!<br />B.  Dague
1,I was happy with this product.  It had a nice flavor and had a great price!
1,While many believe that A id better than B grade I find the B grade maple syrup very rich.  It has more flavor than the A and is excellent to use in both baking and with roasted fowl and pork.
1,"I bought this 1/2 gallon because I am a big fan of Grade B maple syrup.  Grade B has a more pronounced maple flavor than Grade A syrup.  The price on this syrup is good, and the jug has a flip top, so that you do not have to unscrew the cap to pour a serving."
1,"Arrived soon enough, last for a pretty long time, tastes good and it is good for you. Will buy again."
1,Great price for a very good quality syrup. It really has a deep and full maple syrup flavor. Not dull or wishy washy.
1,"This maple syrup is excellent in taste and economy. We do not use any of the processed syrups on the market and to find a great real maple syrup at an affordable price is really tough.  This Organic Maple Syrup from NOW has it all...price, ease of ordering and best of all wonderful flavor with nothing added.  I'm buying another jug soon."
1,"I bought this maple syrup for the master cleanse diet but then ended up eating it for some healthy pancakes and boy o boy is this syrup super yummy!!!!  My 2 and 4 year olds love it.  Also, the price is great!"
1,"This maple syrup is delicious and is strictly maple syrup -- nothing added.  Plus, you receive wonderful minerals and vitamins.  I used for the Master Cleanse and it really made the ""lemonade"" drink tasty.  If I were to eat pancakes, I would only use this syrup, rich in minerals and vitamins.  Enjoy!"
0,"If I could put zero stars I would!<br /><br />I purchased two 64-fl oz containers of pure maple syrup from Nutricity through Amazon. The product was fine. Then without ever using it, I decided I wanted to return it for a refund. I printed the return authorization and the shipping label from the Amazon website, paid an extra $15 for shipping, and sent the items back. About two weeks later I got an email from Nutricity stating that their policy is no refunds on grocery items, and if I wanted the product back I would have to pay for shipping back to me. That's fine if that's their policy, but it was not clearly stated, and if that is their policy, I should not have been able to print a return authorization from the Amazon website. I feel like I have been ripped off. VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!<br /><br />Save yourself the headache, and just buy this from someone else!"
1,"This is good syrup and my 2nd favorite.  It has a medium sweetness when compared with the other 2 that I've tried.  I typically don't like things very sweet.  I used 3 syrups listed below for my Master Cleanse.  They are all good quality and I'd recommend any of them.  You probably will want 1 jug for every 5 days of a cleanse.  It is possible that you'll need more.  I'm not an expert to comment on darkness or many other factors.  Here's my brief breakdown:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00271OPVU"">Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug</a> - The sweetest of the 3 for sure.  It is also probably the thickest but still runny.  200 calories per serving of 4 tbsp.  When I put this in my lemonade for the Master Cleanse, it makes the lemonade sweeter than how I like it.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ENHSC8"">NOW Foods Maple Syrup Grade B Organic, 32 ounce</a> - Is less sweet when compared to Coombs but a little sweeter than Family Heritage.  Runnier than Coombs but these syrups are all a little runnier than grocery syrups.  200 calories per serving of 4 tbsp.  It provided the right amount of sweetness for the Master Cleanse specifications for a drink.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00248E980"">Family Heritage Organic Vermont Maple Syrup, Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug</a> - Good quality and tastes sweet but definitely not as sweet as the other 2.  Didn't get the calorie info before throwing the bottle away but I'm figuring it's the same as the other 2.  I usually put an extra 1/2 a tbsp in my master cleanse lemonade to get it a little sweeter and curb the hunger."
1,"This is really good maple syrup, packed with flavor, dense, and dark. Naturally it takes homemade waffles and pancakes to the next level, but it can also add a dash of magic to other breakfast staples, such as oatmeal or muffins. It is hard to imagine how commercial syrups laden with artificial flavors, colors, and other content can even be marketed as syrup---this is the real deal."
1,"I'm from Maine and I have to tell you that I would never buy grade A maple syrup. If I'm going to use maple syrup, I want that rich, distinctive taste, not something that's barely different than white sugar. That's actually a good comparison - grade A is to grade B as white is to brown sugar. I know we're all used to thinking of ""grade A"" as meaning of superior quality, but that's not how it works with this. It is referring to the level of filtering/processing the sap goes through. If you want generic sweetness, go grade A. For everything else, grade B. This is a trusted brand of organic syrup with a great flavor. By the way, for baking and real maple syrup afficionados, there is also a grade C (even darker)!"
1,"This is my favorite syrup. I was happy with the price, the shipping and the flavor of this syrup.  The 64 oz lasted a very long time."
1,just what i was looking for and at a WAY better price than my local health food store!<br /><br />thanks!
1,Excellent syrup!  If you haven't tried REAL maple syrup then you are missing out.  Try this delicious treat on your next waffle/pancake/ect...
1,This has a nice full flavor. i thought that since this isn't made in Vermont it wouldn't be very good but it's just fine.
1,"If you are thinking of doing the Master Cleanse, this is the product you are looking for.  It is reasonably priced, high quality and exactly fits all the specifications they recommend.  One note, if you are going to do the full 10 days you will either need 2 or an additional 32 oz. I personally liked it as a table syrup as well.  It's the ""stout"" of maple syrups."
1,The maple syrup is delicious!  The product was shipped very quickly.  I needed to talk with the shipper about a minor problem and they were very accommodating.  I would definitely buy from them again.
1,"I use maple syrup for almost all of my sweetening - in baking, granola,whatever; and Now Grade B organic syrup is wonderful! We also received it within a few days of ordering."
1,I started using this product for the Master Cleanse (lemonade diet). I have tried other brands but found this one to be the best.  I highley recommend it.  The only problem I have found is in the shipping sometimes the plastic cap gets broken even though they pack it well the delivery people most likely have dropped it at some point.  Thats the way it goes sometimes.  Since the jug is sealed it's still usable.
1,"I have all three in my frige, so I did taste test""s""?-<br /><br />1. Just pouring straight into a spoon/tasting?-<br /><br />Coombs<br />Highland<br />NOW<br /><br />2. Heated 1/8cup (all 3), mixed in 1tsp of LandO'Lakes butter (Canola), and poured onto 3 Eggo Blueberry waffles?-<br /><br />NOW Shines ""On Food""!- I can Really taste the yummy maple, and not too sweet!  :o)<br />Coombs was just OK- The maple was Very mild, but the sugary sweetness was overpowering (ALA Mrs. Butterworth's (HFCS!)).<br />Highland- Virtually tasteless, and I tossed it."
1,"Awesome product looks good and tastes great!  Good price, too.  Bought this one from Supplement Warehouse.  Makes a great sweatener and tastes good by itself as well."
1,"It took me almost 2 weeks to get the product only because it was out of stock, but I have no complaints really. I think I will have to put another order, for the master cleanse I dont think this will be enough for 10 days, I could be wrong."
1,"Due to dietary restrictions, I cannot use this myself. However I sent this to my sister in Germany as part of her Christmas present. She absolutely RAVED about it!"
1,"Due to it's economy price, I was concerned about the quality before the order arrived. But when I received the order, I found the maple syrup has great taste with excellent flavor. The order arrived in time as expected. Good customer service. Highly recommended !"
1,"Based on the other 2 reviews I chose to give this brand of syrup a try.  WOW, it has a deep, rich, buttery flavor and aroma.  My husband has been wanting pancakes just so he can eat the syrup! I've used it for a Master Cleanse and don't know if it's the quality of the syrup or what, but have had better success with detoxing using this than a Grade A or other brand of Grade B (this is my 3rd MC).  I look forward to using this for breakfast and baking, I will reorder again and recommend to friends and family! It would make a great gift in a gourmet gift basket!"
1,"I have used real maple syrup for years.  When my kids were small I used the standard stuff until I started becoming a label reader, then I could not in good conscience continue to serve a product that amounted to a liquid chemical concoction.  I recently discovered grade B syrup, which has a stronger, more molassas kind of flavor.  Besides the obvious pancakes and french toast, I also use it on oatmeal and in baked goods.  Will continue to purchase."
1,"This syrup is delicious! My husband and I had some this morning on our pancakes and we both loved it. However, my 8 year old son, whose taste buds have been conditioned to the tune of high fructose corn syrup type syrups, thought the taste was too strong. Hopefully his taste buds will develop and he will learn to like this as it is SO much healthier than the typical grocery store offerings. Will definitely purchase again!"
0,"This looks like a better deal than it REALLY is, and I wonder how many people who actually did the math for themselves would truly be pleased.<br /><br />This product is listed as 64 ounces, for a cost of $39.75, and they break it down as $0.41 per ounce. This would be a fantastic deal.<br /><br />HOWEVER, $39.75 for 64 ounces means this costs over $0.62 per ounce! This is not cool. I'm not sure if this was done intentionally, but it's bad business."
1,"This is a nice way to go if you need maple syrup in bulk, like in order to do the Master Cleanse, like I did. It will last you nearly a week.  It is not too sweet, so you don't get a headache if you put a little too much on your pancakes, either.... wait - Is there such a thing as too much syrup on pancakes? No."
1,I have done the master cleanse several times and the last time I used Now's grade B syrup instead of buying it at our local health food store to save money.  It tastes great but I have health problems and the last few times I've done the cleanse I have felt really bad and I assume that is why and not because of the quality of the syrup. I only mention it in order to give an honest review...But as I said it tastes great so I assume if it were inferior it wouldn't..
1,The Maple Syrup was shipped very quickly.  We are very pleased with this seller and would purchsae from again and again!
1,"I've ordered this syrup 4 times now and I use it for the Master Cleanse.  Tastes great and can be used for ""regular"" syrup as well."
1,"Non-GE - ""GE"" stands for genetic engineering and is also referred to as GMO (genetically modified organism). Genetic engineering of food products uses gene splicing to overcome natural boundaries that would otherwise prohibit the creation of a product. Genes from different species can be combined to create a hardier product resistant to certain exogenous factors. As an example, you might be able to add fish genes to corn to make it resistant to pesticides. Although there may be ""instant gratification"" from such benefits as better taste, longer shelf life, and greater yield, serious concerns exist about the long-term ramifications of using these types of products and ingredients. Until more research backing the safety of GE products is available, we'll continue to make every effort to use only non-GE ingredients and products"
1,I am very satisfied with this product.  I would purchase this item again. I did not give it 5 stars because I am not so knowledgeable on Maple Syrups to know if it is the best out there.
1,I can tell you it arrived in good shape and in good timing.  We have not opened it yet though.
0,"THIS PRODUCT IS NOT AS IT APPEARS! THE BOTTLE IS TINY, BUT LOOKS LIKE A STANDARD 32oz BOTTLE, IN THE PICTURE! If you fall for the picture, as I did, without paying attention to the fluid oz. size, then you end up paying 30 dollars for a 32oz. bottle, which normally sells for under 20 dollars. Legal but very deceptive....BOYCOTT these Charlatans!"
0,"What does Non-GE mean?<br />One of the most annoying things about Amazon, whether the product be sold by them or through them, are the incomplete descriptions.<br />  The information would be helpful to potential buyers and therefore to the seller.  Incomplete descriptions only lead me to ask: what are they hiding, or, are they trying to dump something on the unsuspecting?"
1,"Product is listed as flaxseeds and that's what I received however, I was interested in flaxseed meal, as indicated in the product description."
1,"I recently discovered ordering Bob's Red Mill products through Amazon for baking ingredients that may be difficult to find in local stores.  I grind the whole flaxseeds to a meal using a coffee grinder and primarily use the flaxseed meal to replace all or some of the butter and oil in baked goods recipes.  Sounds sketchy but it really does work - in my experience, even in yeast bread recipes!  It has a very subtle, almost undetectable flavor and you'll see little flecks of the meal in your baked product, particularly if all white flour is used.  Store ground flaxseed in fridge or freezer.  Flaxseed meal has multiple health benefits including Omega-3's, lignans, fiber.  Here's how to add the meal to your baked goods (copied from Livestrong.com):<br /><br />-Add flaxseed meal to breads, muffins, pastries, cookies and other baked goods for extra nutrition and to produce a nutty flavor. According to the Barleans website, flaxseed meal should compose a minimum of 6 to 8 percent of the dry ingredients in any recipe.<br /><br />-Replace the oil, shortening, butter or margarine with flaxseed meal in any baked goods recipe at a ratio of 3:1. If a recipe calls for 1/3 cup of oil, for example, replace with 1 cup flaxseed meal. Flaxseed meal has a high oil content, but contains less fat than most oils, shortening, butter and margarine.<br /><br />-Reduce the flour in any baked goods recipe by 25 percent and replace with flaxseed meal. If a recipe requires 1 cup flour, for example, use 3/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup flaxseed meal instead. Using flaxseed meal this way adds a slight nutty flavor and a golden brown color to your baked goods.<br /><br />-Use flaxseed meal as replacement for eggs in baked goods. Combine 1 tbsp. flaxseed meal with 3 tbsp. water for each egg and let the mixture stand for about five minutes before using in batters and doughs.<br /><br />Read more:[...]"
1,"Much better than the crushed seeds I get a local store. I eat them every day in my oatmeal. When cooked, they swell a bit and are crunchy."
1,"It's hard to find good sushi ginger when you live in a small midwestern city, so I am glad that I can get this product through Amazon.  I used it as an accompaniment for grilled tuna, sushi, and other Asian dishes.  It's also great as a little snack just by itself!"
1,"This ginger is very tasty on its own, with sushi, and with any seafood. I signed up for the Subscribe and Save program for this item, which gives 15% off the price and allows you to choose how often you want to receive the product (no obligation, no shipping charges.) Initially, I indicated 6 months, but my daughter and I ran out of it in a little more than a month, so I changed the order to be delivered every month. In addition, there is a promotion until March 31, 2010, which allows you to save an additional 10% (bringing it to 25% off) if you use the promo code ROLAND77"
1,I love pickled ginger. This has a little more bite than I'm used to but it still has a wonderful sweet taste. I eat it with sushi or even with a sandwich like olives or pickles. It's good anytime.
0,"I purchased 8 jars based on reviews I read.  I was very disappointed in the quality of the ginger compared to what I get in restaurants and what I buy at the store.  The ginger was much thicker that what I considered normal and not the ""pink"" color I was expecting.  The taste also was not what I consider to be ""premium"".  Maybe I just got a sub standard batch, but I definitely would not reorder this product."
0,"When most reviews are so  good, I tend to be suspect of the  rare poor one. Unfortunately, after trusting the good reviews (and figuring the negative one was an outlyer of sorts), I purchased this ginger.  Extremely disappointed!  It is very thick - which to me is not a problem. But, it is unusually hot...I've never had HOT ginger before (spicy -yes,fire HOT- no).  Moreover, the balance of the spices/ingredients is just weird, leading to a very nasty bitter... almost chemical, lingering aftertaste, which I'm attributing to possibly (??) the type of or an overuse of preservative, since the nasty aftertaste isn't consistent with any of the common ingredients. If you must, try it for yourself (as did I), but be forewarned. Hopefully, I'll be able to send it back and get my return shipping reimbursed. This is NOTHING like the wonderful ginger served in a restaurant with sushi."
1,"This Roland Sushi Ginger is my husband's favorite by far. I also think it tastes the best. It has just the right balance of ginger flavor and sweet and sour. We have tried two other brands and have found them wanting. One was waaay too salty. The other just didn't have enough of a ginger taste. We are patiently waiting for Amazon to return this brand to stock. I hope we don't have to wait too much longer. PLEASE, PLEASE bring it back."
1,"For the most part, I really like this ginger. I would, however, encourage the company to use glass jars rather than plastic. I just don't trust plastic jars. In fact, I went ahead and emptied out all eight jars into one large, glass Mason jar. We go through ginger pretty quickly, so I'm not worried about it spoiling."
1,This is great to have for finishing up at your sushi party table. The ginger is so good even though you only need a little to complete ending a wonderful meal of sushi. So Good.
0,"For those who like ginger, this product is fine on its own merits. However, for sushi, the product is not appropriate. For one thing, the slices are really thick and large which completely overwhelms the sushi flavour. Ginger is a supposed to be a complement to the sushi meal. The ginger should be thinly sliced, almost translucent. This is something else which is fine for other meals. For instance, I dice the slices for my other dishes."
1,"I loved this product!!  I made sushi using the Sushezi and it came out great!!  For me, the ginger is the essential ingredient to finish the sushi. It can be a little thickly cut, but for me, this is not bothersome.  I will definitely order this again."
1,"I used to spoon big gobbets of this stuff onto my plastic plate at salad bars, here in New York city, and was thrilled to find it was available as part of Amazon's Subscribe and Save program.  By signing up for delivery at a specified interval, I saved 15% off the price, with every shipment coming free of shipping charges.<br /><br />My elderly father, who favors rather sweet mango chutneys, was similarly enthralled, and we may have to invoke one of Amazon's Subscribe and Save options.  You can order an additional shipment, or cancel a given shipment, at any time.<br /><br />Great stuff, hard to find, sold in bulk, delivered free - that's Amazon."
0,"I have been eating Sushi and Ginger for over 25 years and this is the worst Sushi Ginger I have ever tasted. Unfortunately, my entire family feels the same way and we're stuck with 8 jars of this stuff..."
0,"Received this ginger in the mail and at least two of the bottles were leaking.  The 'liner' used beneath the lids does not appear to be sealed well at all, on any of the bottles.  We were actually a little nervous about even eating any of the bottles.  After going through and tossing several, we decided to keep the remainder and re-package them in canning jars to help preserve them.  The ginger is sliced fairly thick and we have to cut it down to make it managable for eating on our sushi.  All in all, the flavor is decent, but a lot of tedious work to get to that point.  In the future, we will either can our own or try and find a local carrier to buy our sushi ginger."
0,"The seller states in the product description that the quantity of Kefir grains will be enough to make one cup of milk. The amount I received was just over a teaspoon and the seller's directions which came with it said to put it in a quarter of a cup of milk. The grains seemed rather delicate and I've been ""babying"" them for about a week now and still haven't been able to make a cup of Kefir. Their fragile state was probably in part due to the way they were shipped. They were put without any liquid in a tiny, sealed, thin plastic envelope which was placed in an un-padded, business sized letter envelope. The $5.49 shipping seems rather steep for two stamps and a remarkable lack of special packaging. If I had it to do over again I would probably order from somewhere else. That being said, I have been able to make Kefir--albeit in doll portions---and the flavor is good."
0,"Seller talks about growing kefir is like art, but the kefir that i got from him was flat. After readind on ""DOM'S KEFIR"" site i believe the grain was squeezed by the ""Seller"" ouch !"
1,The grains were fresh and plump and produced Kefir well...re-produced more grains well also.  They grew very quickly and we ended up eating many because they have re-produced so much.<br />I liked the recipes and instructions that came with them also.<br />I also appreciated the list of the numerous bacteria contained in kefir he/she included.<br /><br />Good seller - good product.  Sorry to see others had problems.
1,"I bought grains from the Amazon seller ""Drybyma Treasures"" about a month and a half ago. I received them in 3 days, and they took about 3 days to recover from their ordeal in the mail, producing some very nasty sour-milk-tasting stuff the first day and some very yeasty-tasting stuff the second two days. But their fourth attempt was delicious and by now they've fully recovered and are reproducing like mad. Drybyma sent about 2 tablespoons of grains in the original package, but in a couple of weeks I had half a cup and a week after that I had almost a full cup of grains. I've had to give some grains away and eat some in order to keep the population down.<br /><br />The grains looked like cottage cheese curds when they first arrived. But then they started producing noodle-like shapes and recently began producing tiny cauliflower shapes. It's interesting how they develop.<br /><br />The kefir they produce tastes similar to the kefir I used to buy at my neighborhood Whole Foods store. Sometimes it's more tart than other times, and thickness also varies. I've used both Jersey milk and goat's milk. The thickest, mildest kefir I've made was with raw light cream.<br /><br />Unfortunately Drybyma doesn't seem to be selling kefir grains at the moment. Perhaps they sold out and need to rebuild their stock. Hopefully they'll return so other shoppers can enjoy their product. I can't really rate any other seller's kefir grains because quality can vary."
0,"I don't think the seller, greenyoung, could have possibly sent a smaller amount of kefir.  will buy from another supplier."
1,Real-man-of-genius provides excellent and timely support for his kefir grains. I just received mine and had a question which I posted late last night.  This morning to my suprise the answer arrived.  I look forward to making my kefir.
1,"Not only did the product arrive in a super speedy manner, but the grains are of the highest quality. We've been making kefir that is out of this world!!!"
1,these things grow so fast I have way too much now.  They are real easy to care for and produce great kefir.
0,"The grains I got didn't look like the one you see on the pic. The one I got had to come from Antarctida bec they were yellow (probably they were frozen before)they also not growing...the amount I got was invisible to my eyes, I complain to the seller so they send me a little more grains but they were still yellow and kind of dead bec they didnt grow. If you want to waste $10 and some time go for it!!! I would really recommend to order it somewere else."
1,I can't say enough how happy I am. I got my grains on November 5th and just yesterday I gave I tbls to a friend. I am Making delicious kefir everyday.
0,"I used organic whole milk** to try to grow the grains from the scant teaspoon I received from the seller. The milk didn't develop a sourish smell, so I guess it stayed fresh, even after 30 days, but I had few and very small--size of uncooked rice--grains. I will stay with the packaged Kefir Starter that I've used for years and which I purchase from Amazon.com.<br /><br />Though I received a couple of pages of instructions from the seller, whose product is shown here at Amazon, those instructions didn't really help me, a novice at growing my own grains. I haven't bothered to contact the seller for help and/or more grains, because it seems a waste of time. I would guess from reading his enclosed instructions that while he tried to be helpful he doesn't really know how to instruct a novice in using the small amount of grains he sent.<br /><br />I am guessing that the pics showing huge grains on websites could just be marketing examples wherein the grower has been using raw milk or something like it. That's just a guess on my part, and if that is the case, it is an example of good marketing, but the sites need to give more-helpful information to the novice.<br /><br />**Perhaps that was my problem? At any rate, I love, love, love kefir as do my kittykats."
1,"The grains arrived in less than one week from date of order.  There were a few yellowish curds with a milky coating in a plastic baggy, inside a small brown envelope.  I placed them in milk and a day later the milk had curdled.  I strained and got a very watery whey that I drank.  It had a curious taste, not unpleasant, but not yogurt-like, as I had expected.  I put all the curds back in the jar and covered them with a cup of milk.  The next day the whey was more white, but very watery.  It took about ten days of this routine before I was getting a good creamy kefir through the strainer and a good separtion of the grains for re-culturation.  I'm seeing an increase in the number of grains each week, but not overwhelming.  I think my strainer allows some of the very small ones through.  It's an interesting process and I love the results.  My wife's heartburn has disappeared in the past month and I attribute it to the kefir."
0,"This is my first experience ordering kefir grains and growing them.  It seemed to me that<br />the shipping and handling charge were rather high for such a small amount (size of a<br />walnut or less.)  Also the directions should have come with the grains - not 6 days later<br />via email. Why so much later?  By then I had already handled them following directions<br />from my son who had recommended a source for them.  So, I was not pleased.<br />Carolyn Hocker, Newville, PA."
0,The Kefir grains arrive in good shape and packaged very well.  I used them in raw goat milk but did not have great success.  I did send an e-mail to the seller but never had a reply.  I eventually discarded the grains.
1,"Grains came very quickly. Produce great tasting kefir and multiply like rabbits. My girlfriend and I have been selling our new grains to locals and giving them away to family and friends. In about 1 months, we had 8x as many grains as we started with."
1,"The kefir granules arrived in excellent condition.  I followed the instructions but found that my granules ""worked"" very fast and required a quart of milk very soon after I got them.  The first 2 weeks the kefir was very watery, as the granules were ""settling in.""  I had to leave for a short trip, so I put a batch in the fridge for 2-3 days.  Ever since then the kefir (I make 4-day-old kefir cheese rather than 1-day-old kefir) has been beautiful and creamy and very tangy.  I'm getting used to the flavor, introducing it to lots of friends, and enjoy making it!  It's so easy.  I love that you just throw it in a clean jar with milk and put it in the cupboard for 1-4 days.  No cooking.  The straining is easy and the whey is super sour.  I use it in smoothies and use it to ferment/pickle veggies.  Best of all, the kefir cheese is high in vitamins as well as being a fantastic probiotic.  I don't think I'll ever stop drinking/eating it.  I do a lot of traveling, but I can easily take it with me in a 3 oz. or smaller glass bottle that I keep in my hand-checked bag when I go on trips.  I use fresh (or powdered if fresh is unavailable) goat milk and it's really good and healthy."
1,"First batch was lost in the mail so a second batch was promptly sent.  The amount of grains was small but you do not need a lot!  After several months, the grains are about two tablespoons in size.  I have already given some away to other kefir drinkers here in Brazil."
1,I got the Kefir from BIGGIRL22 and received it in 2 days from the order.  The grains were plump and practically ready to go!
1,"The first time I received the grains, they didn't grow at all. The second time I received them for free, they grew wonderfully.Thanks!"
1,"I made the mistake of putting too much milk in the jar the first time I made kefir with these grains (old habit) but thought, what the heck, it won't hurt the grains. In 24 hours I strained the milk out of the grains and added just less than a pint (about 12 ounces) of milk to them the second time (I drank the slightly soured milk from the first batch--not bad) Within 24 hours that short pint had turned into the thickest, smoothest, yummiest kefir ever! I've made 2 more batches since and the last one was with 3 cups of milk. Absolutely perfect. I'm convinced that my next batch will do a full quart. Highly recommend this product.<br /><br />PS: I use a low heat pasteurized milk. I would not recommend using regular pasteurized milk and absolutely DO NOT use ultra-pasteurized milk. Raw milk will work but only for the first and maybe second batch as the wild bacteria in the raw milk compete with the kefir grains. If you use raw milk then always let your kefir grains renew themselves in some pasteurized milk."
1,"These work exactly as described. It took about a week before the Kefir tasted the way I like it, but now it's great. I experimented a little with the timing, but prefer approximately 24 hours per batch. The instructions were fine and they offered a phone number for questions."
1,"**NOTE** When I bought this item, it was sold by ""Lifetime Kefir.""  That no longer appears to be the case.<br /><br />I received about a teaspoon of live milk kefir grains with my purchase and I was not expecting very much out of them, but after a week of following the enclosed directions I had kefir.  At first I only got about a cup of kefir every 24-48 hours, but the grains grew very quickly.  After less than a month, I am now getting a pint or more of kefir every 24 hours and I now have several tablespoons worth of grains.<br /><br />I was rather wary about buying this product after seeing some of the reviews, but it was well worth the money."
1,"I received about a teaspoon of kefir grains in the mail a little more than a week ago. They have since multiplied into well over a tablespoon. I've bought several kefir cultures before and none ever grew nearly that quickly. These grains make a good potent kefir too! This can also be used to make a very flavorful, yummy cheese. Be sure to follow the seller's instructions closely, as these little buggers are potent!<br /><br />The flavor of this is much stronger than store-bought kefir. If you aren't used to the taste you can try mixing it with fruit juice.<br /><br />If you end up with too many grains, and can't give them away, you can eat the extras. They're good with honey. (If you're not used to eating kefir grains you should start with a small amount.)<br /><br />If you have any problems, the seller is very nice and extremely helpful. Probably the nicest person I've dealt with on Amazon."
1,"I purchased these grains a few weeks back. There weren't very many in the small plastic envelope and I wasn't sure how this would turn out. Well, They are finally multiplying and I was able to get a first decent batch yesterday. They still have a long ways to go to produce a pint or two a day but at least they were alive and are doing well. I expected more for the money, but in the end, I got what I wanted."
1,"When the grains arrived, they we're in the form of a liquid. I was concerned that they looked nothing like actual grains. The seller sent along instructions which addressed this. Having been my first experience with grains, I didn't know what to expect. Her instructions, which also contained a source where I could learn more, we're invaluable. The seller was communicative and helpful; standing behind her product if I wasn't satisfied. My grains continue to grow and I am delighted by the service and product. Thank you."
1,When the tiny bit of kefir came I immediately ordered a more expensive product thinking I'd never get anything out of this.  I was wrong--This product is doing everything I wanted and more.
1,"The live kefir grains are amazing! I received them quickly and they were packed in a sanitary and tightly sealed manner. I am extremely satisfied with this product. They are performing better than my expectations, thank you amazon.com<br />I was very leary about buying online. Amazon.com has shone me otherwise."
1,I've made a new batch of kefir via these seeds every day for 2 1/2 years or so and have shared the extra seeds with many. So far so good!
1,I was so impressed with how quickly the grains grew and really love having the healthy milk drink.  We milk so the grains go into fresh milk right from the cow.  I am using keifer cheese too.
1,"These arrived as described. I got them into milk as soon as I could and they have responded very nicely. After about 3 days, as I have replaced the milk about every 12 hours, they've grown and seem to be doing very well."
1,I recieved the grains within a couple of days of placing my order. They arrived in great condition. I followed the directions included in the package and was amazed at how quickly they multiplied. It has been a little over 2 weeks and I have more grains than I need (that's a good thing). The product was everything I'd hoped for. Thank you.
1,"Kefir grains purchased on Amazon.com.After 4 weeks I am just begining to get a consistent yield, during this time I have had everything from dirty water to soft cheese and the flavors are all over the place. It takes some trial and error, timing and temperature are critical and cause tremdous variations. However for 3days I have been yielding good consistent product and the nuts are increasing in size."
1,"The kefir grains were delivered properly packaged and protected. I was pleased with the result after only one try. I had heard that the first two attempts may be a little bitter, but the second attempt was great. I need this for a medical condition and I am glad to finally find a good product."
1,"These Kefir grains were very much alive when they arrived, about 1/2 tsp, still moist...after 3 feedings...they grew, and grew!!  I have had other grains that have died off.<br />Highly recommend!!"
1,Arrived very fresh and ready to go. I had kefir within 48 hours. Tasty and healthy it is now a regular part of our diet.
1,"Arrived 04-13-2010.  By noontime<br />bath on 15th. Already separating and<br />lovely large kernels on top.<br />Using room temp whole organic milk<br />( Organic Valley) and pouring just about<br />one cup into kefir.  Stir about, not even close,<br />to 12 hours and bathing in another cup<br />of milk next 12 hours.  Already too thick<br />to strain thru bouquet garni bag ( just clear<br />whey came thru) and almost too thick to<br />strain thru one layer of cheesecloth.<br />Yellowish-clear layer of separation just<br />halfway down glass about 1/4"" band and<br />fat kernels crusting up on top of milk when<br />time for bath.  Just let it sit on table with<br />papertowel tied over top.  Next time I shall drink some!"
0,"ive had kefir grains in the past and these were never solid.  there was not a clump that I could strain out to save for the next batch.  I tried working with it to make it work hoping they would ""grow"" so I could have a  grain to strain out.  this never happened.  when i wrote them about it they said i was past 90 days.  well i guess i shouldn't have spent so long trying to make it work."
0,"My grains are dead. Where the heck do I contact these people to send me a knew one? Poor packaging. 2 teaspoons worth of Kefir. No instructions. Please send me some new kefir, thanks."
0,I am really dissapointed with the product. I received less than half a teaspoon. I has been really hard to make then to work. I've had kefir pearls before. I know how to take care of them. I would not reccomend this seller. Try a different one.
1,I started making my own Kefir with this product and had great results from the very beginning.  The grains grew fast and are very healthy.
1,"This is not for the weak! It requires work and I mean DAILY maintenance to grow your grains and maintain them. I can buy a few people getting ""bad grains"" but most are probably irritated by how much work it is. You have to keep them fed and alive and you have to care. It's ok if you give up and decide it's just not for you, but don't blame the seller for your own issues. My sister in law got me interested but her milk grains were suffering because she was using Raw milk. SHE researched (not me) that using low pasturized milk helped to grow the grains so when i bought my own (from this seller) I took her advice and used low pasturized milk only as a start. HOLY COW! I uploaded a picture of my grain and it is HUGE. That is just ONE grain mind you, I have either gifted the others, used them for making cheese or (sniff, sniff) tossed them in the disposal because I don't need that much kefir. Most of my grains I have gifted have been murdered because the folks who took them didn't like the maintenance they require. It is hard work people, but it's all about what you are willing to put yourself through for good health. It's ok if you can't handle it, life is hard enough but like I said, don't blame the seller just because you couldn't hack it! Just FYI (more sis in law research here) for a casein and lactose free diet you must let the grains sit for at least 25 - 28 hours. I screwed up and only did 24 hrs and my son is supposed to be on a casein free diet so be careful... It's a science after all. My grain is now large enough that I can use raw milk but I have noticed I still have to rock back and forth between low pasturized and raw in order to keep the grain healthy. I'm sure some folks would disagree with me but I'm just going on my own experience here and the proof is in the pudding so to speak. Have fun!"
1,"Excellent! The  ""grains"" arrived quickly. I read the easy to follow directions and then got to work. My friends, these""grains"", moved fast. I quickly had two then four cups of kefir. For two people, we are getting plenty of kefir. In fact, I regularly put the starter jar in the refrigerator to slow the growth down. My ""grains"" have grown, so I now have a dehydrated  batch of grains, in case something goes wrong. The kefir is delicious! The kefir ""grains"" are happy and we are happy. Very pleased with the product and the supplier!"
1,"I just received our kefir grains in the mail.  There was about a tsp of healthy looking grains.  After 12 hours of doing what the instructions said, the grains already doubled in size.  Very, very happy with this seller!"
0,I don't know if I'm doing it wrong or if the kefir grains I have are not any good. I've had the milk grains for about 3 weeks and I'm following the directions exactly. The grains are actually growing but every batch that I've made has that rotten sour milk taste.  Any tips that anybody might have that could save this batch or do I just chuck these and start a new?  The water grains I got you are doing great.
1,"Purchased live kefir grains. was afraid that they would suffer in shipping, but they are strong and healthy and producing good kefir. Very pleased. Thank you."
1,I bought these to avoid paying high prices for kefir in the store when I could culture it myself. I've been culturing my own kefir for over 3 months now and have been able to share grains with family and friends. I have no reservations recommending this product!
1,"I received my kefir grains well within the time allotted.  As I'm new to kefir making, I was happy to see the excellent instructions included with my order.  Believe it or not, I still found a way to screw things up (by using milk kefir grains to make water kefir!) and sent off an email to Seller. Actually I sent three emails, and all three were promptly answered, with all the help I could ever ask for.  As I had perhaps ruined my kefir grains (too early to tell), Seller offered to replace them!  I can't imagine anyone being unhappy with this Seller's service, and I'm betting I'll have some very good kefir before too long!"
1,"These great grains! I kept them in my refrigerator for over a month before starting to grow them. In only a little over a week, I'm making 2 cups of kefir a day,it tastes great, and the grains are growing very well. My first Kefir making experience has been a success! Thanks!"
1,I ordered this kefir to be sent as a birthday gift to a friend.  The seller was very quick to send the kefir and it arrived safely.  There was a small problem which the seller promptly corrected and now my friend is delighted to have success with kefir fermenting. Thank you!
1,I was happy with the product but i paid extra to get it here fast (a lot extra) and i think it took 5 days:(. whats the point of 2 day shipping it if you don't get it in 2?
0,The amount of kefir grains was tiny. I ended up pitching them. They might be fine for those with the patience to grow them -- I wanted more than a few teaspoons of kefir.
1,"Okay, so you get this little plastic envelope with these ""grains"" of stuff that is good for your guts.  The envelope barely looks like something legal.  Then you ""grow"" them in milk.  It takes time and patience, something my wife actually has (except where I am concerned, of course), and we are in the process of being self-supplying in this yogurt-like product.  We had a bit of a false start -- it did not show up for weeks after we ordered it -- but the company has been very solicitous and customer-service oriented since then.  So we are hoping for the best..."
1,"I am really happy about this KEFIR GRAINS because they are very strong and potent, Just after 3 weeks their population will reach to double and after 4 weeks I could make 1 liter Kefir every 24 hours."
0,"The picture of the K-cup shows ""Extra Bold"" but received ""Light Roast"" !Very disappointed !Maybe that's why the price was lower than others. Be careful ordering."
1,"This is a very flavorful decaf, and we are very happy with this choice. This was a reasonably priced product."
1,"K-cup decaf was as described, and it came with surprising promptness.  We've ordered from this company before and always found it satisfactory."
0,"My mom didn't like these the one year I bought them for her for mother's day. She really likes tea too. Wouldn't get this again. Admoittedly, they look somewhat off-putting."
1,"The first time I gave my cats this cat nip, I put a little on their toys, scratching post and left to go to work, (my usual routine if I leave for more than a few hours). When I cam home,late that day, my most lazy and independent cat, Luna would not stop following me around. He cried and purred and wanted to be on my lap and in general, acted super weird. I phoned my husband in a panic - I was so sure he was ill! We retraced Luna's day together - I had forgotten about the new 'nip- My husband started laughing..""He's stoned!"" What? ""It's the new Catnip!"" Oh. That was the only new thing and Luna was just super happy.<br />Well, I started giving waaaaay less catit nip in the morning before leaving or whenever, and now they are more normal, but even the other guy, Besos, actually climbs into the csbinet to try to find the catit 'nip if I don't give them some! They are acting younger again! they have never loved 'nip before, just kind of played with it, ate it and acted like, hey this stuff is pretty good, thanks.... Now they ask for it. Cute! Get some, but don't give too much the first time!"
1,This coffee is a good buy for someone who likes cream in their cup.  Its more of a mellow flavor than a medium roast.  Cheep enuff to at least give it a try.
1,Everyone around here chews gum but I wanted to get something that had some flavor (this has great flavor if you love sour apple) and that I could pop bubbles with. I have fond memories carrying and enjoying big league bubble gum as a kid and 20 something years later it's just as much fun.<br />The boss came out of his office to see who kept popping bubbles and we all stopped chewing and went back to our normal routines.<br />It was like our parent getting on to us but we fooled him....this time.
1,"I ordered this gum for my husband who absolutely LOVES anything sour. He was definitely not disappointed! I even like it myself! It has the perfect sourness in the beginning, but as you're chewing it, it slowly changes into this mostly sweet flavor with a mild sour aftertaste. We can't get enough of it! =) Will probably order again once our box runs out."
1,Torani's regular syrups are made with pure cane sugar. I use the root beer syrup with SodaStream carbonated water to make great root beer soda and floats.
0,I am no bimbo but I don't want my teeth to fall out? I got visit Dentist almost twice a year and its not exactly enriching to see item without sugar content and fat content and calories per serving? Is this a fake product?
1,"Great Taste, No Corn Syrup and No Refrigeration after opening. This is the best syrup to flavor your coffee because it is naturally sweet with sugar and not corn syrup."
1,This is the only chocolate syrup product I can find on the shelf at my local grocery store that contains NO SOY and NO HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP. I like how it tastes and how it mixes easily with milk.
1,"These were given to me as a gift this year. I have a well-developed sweet tooth, and these truffles are so rich and smooth that I could only eat one or two at a time. They are the perfect little indulgence."
0,Not that great. I was really looking foward to receiveing these when they came in I try a few and there just nothing to write home about. I can think of several company that make better chocolate.
1,"This onion sauce is great, and go's great with corn silver side so get your self some Colman's Onion sauce, you will love it.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051C0DN6"">Colmans Onion Sauce Sachet 35g</a>"
1,"This review is for the 1.7 ounce bottle.  I bought some, because I do not like the fact that over 95% of Equal is dextrose, sugar (only 1.7% is aspartame).  White sugar is a mix of dextrose and fructose.<br /><br />First off the white powder you get is sweet and tastes just like Equal to me.  For one gallon of tea I use 0.5 grams of the aspartame powder.  If you use too much you will get the bitter taste.  This is true also with Equal, if you put too many packets in it tastes bad.<br /><br />I fixed this problem long ago, I never use just Equal.  In the early days of my usage I added white sugar.  Then later I found I could drop the sugar and replace it with Sweet'N Low.  So to my tea I used 10 packets of Equal to 4 packets of Sweet'N Low.  You can drink as much as you like all day long without an after taste.  So with the aspartame powder, to my 0.5 grams of the aspartame I add the 4 packets of Sweet'N Low.<br /><br />The real problem with powdered Aspartame is it does not dissolve in water well.  It is a very fine powder and can't break the water's surface tension.  It tries to clump and even when not clumped it forms a cloudy water.  You solve this by the same method of making gravy from starch.  You put your powder in a small bowl and add water drop by drop and make a paste.  Then dissolve the paste in the water of your tea or whatever you are sweetening.<br /><br />But this is why the powdered Aspartame is packaged with dextrose in the Equal packets.  So the particles of Aspartame are separated by the dextrose particles.  Thus it dissolves."
1,"This shimmering preserve is indescribable -- the rich, mellow, almost caramel-like sweetness of fresh figs with a bright lemony spark. just delectable as is or as a recipe ingredient or as a garnish for a dish. Scrumptious. It was all I could do not to eat the whole container at one sitting. Five stars all the way. DELISH! Try it sliced thinly over a rice cake"
1,I have been purchasing these at Walmart for 3.68 per package.  They have the texture of home-style noodles and taste great.
1,"""Tender but firm""! Cooked in just 3 minutes to al dente- perfecto!!! recipe on the back was awesome- so glad I received this as a gift- I turned right around & order some different flavors."
1,"i look all over for a pasta that taste fresh and was easy to cook,well this is what i been looking for it taste great was easy to cook it say 7 minute i did my noodle 8 and it was just 2 good added some chopped meat or vegs or eat alone with ov or butter"
1,"We have always purchased this pasta at the local grocery store, as we enjoy the many different flavors. Sometimes we toss it with alfredo sauce, but mostly we enjoy it with a little bit of olive oil and parmesan cheese.<br /><br />The price for a case of this via Amazon was much less expensive than buying it at the grocery store (I live in Alaska, and everything is up-priced).<br /><br />I bought a case of the Garlic and a case of the Spinach. A nice staple to have on hand."
1,"If your dog loves peanut butter, it will love SmartBones Peanut Butter Dog Chew. I purchased the 8-pack Mini and is my dog JJ's favorite treat. Product should be offered in larger quantities, maybe 12 to 24 in a package as they don't last long in our house!"
1,My dogs love these and so much easier on them than rawhide bones.  I buy these all the time!  And they love peanut butter flavor!
1,"Seller had the product out and to us very fast, TY.  The only thing wrong with the product was there wasn't enough to last!!  My Goldens ate them up in a couple of bites:0) Better buy a bunch!!!"
0,"The price is good, size is perfect...but my dog doesn't like them at all. Would not buy again sorry. Not the products fault"
1,"What a great product for dogs. My mini doxie just loves these chew and to top it of, she loves the peanut butter favor. The day is  complete when she is given one. If she doen't eat it at once, she will hide it for later or carry it around with her. This flavor is the only one that she eats. I purchase the mini size because it is not too big for her and she can handle it for eating or carrying it around."
1,My dog loves the taste of these...they're a nice change from rawhides..I feel like I can give him treats more often
1,"My dogs recognize the package & the sound of the tear-off top. As soon as they get a whiff of that peanut-butter flavor, they start dancing & prancing around me!  I''ve gotten these before - the only negative part is the dogs snarf these up too fast!"
1,"My dog loves the flavor and texture of these bones! Since they are dried, they allow that stiff resistance for bigger dogs mouths without the rawhide. Great product."
1,Great product! My pup is spoiled but these treats are his favorite.  He loves the peanut butter flavored ones the best.
1,SmartBones are a wonderful treat for your dogss.  My two Dachushunds love the peanut butter flavor.  Not only do they love them they are wonderful for them.
1,"My dogs LOVE these Smartbones!  So much so that they sometimes turn their noses at other treats I try to give them.  These bones are a great alternative to rawhide, and Amazon & Co. have some of the lowest prices on them.  I have seen them sold for as high as $15.99 in some local stores.  The only downside is that they do not last very long, as they are so easy to chew through.  My dogs (Lab mix and Boxer mix) power through the medium and large sized bones in just a few minutes.  Still, all in all, worth the money!"
1,These are the best bones for your dogs.  No rawhide and my labs love them.  Well work the money.  I have been ordering these for about 3months now and always a great transaction.  Delievery has arrived either on time or early. A++++++++++++++++++
1,My dogs love them.  They don't last very long with the larger dog. Will order more some time. Good price.
1,"Our Cocker Spaniel Tinker Bell got this from Santa, and she picked it over all the other treats. It was gone in no time."
1,My dog loves Smart Bones Peanut Butter Dog Chew Minis...your dog will love them too! Good for digestion and affordable.
0,"I was ready to buy it, but passed it up. Why? Because it has corn syrup in it. Corn syrup has been linked to obesity and diabetes. For all the benefits of pomegranate juice, you lose it with the corn syrup."
1,Langers 100% Pomegranate Juice has no added sugar or corn syrup. It has three times the amount of antioxidant activity of wine.  Some in the health care field are recommending it as a possible preventative of prostate cancer.  You should do some research on this if this is your reason to drink this juice.
1,"Have been using Venizelos coffee since 1976 and it simply is the best canned Greek coffee this side of the Mediterranean.<br />Just not certain why the shipping charge costs more than the coffee. This is less than a pound and shipping should reflect that weight, No special handling is required."
1,"Just to be clear- this is not authentic French onion soup.<br /><br />I've made the real thing- versions that require a few days and a lot of beef to make the stock, and those are delightful if one has the time and money and dedication.<br /><br />This kit is for when one does NOT have that time, money, and dedication. It also has some rather odd- as French onion soups go- but flavorful additions such as carrots and tiny lentils.<br /><br />However, when made up it is easy and very good; it does not taste like it was made from a mix; it does have a lot of onion flavor- rather the point of FOS; and the added ingredient list is not excessive (to my recollection, it calls for a sauteed sweet onion in butter, 6 cups low-sodium beef broth, apple juice, and Worcestershire sauce).<br /><br />I served it with gruyere toasts: pieces of italian bread, toasted, with gruyere melted onto them, as a nod to the classic ""croutons"",and my family liked it very much.<br /><br />Sauteed browned mushrooms would be an excellent addition, which I will do if I make this again!"
0,I made the French Onion soup and Didn't care much for it. Maybe I put to much onion in it.
1,"I'm a big spice mix fan and have to give a strong thumbs-up for Chef Tom's Bengal Masala Rub. Surprisingly, this is neither a 'burn your mouth hot' rub, nor is it even heavy on the cumin and curry flavors.  (Though why *wouldn't* you be surprised, given the exceedingly generic Product Description that Amazon lists for this mix!)<br /><br />There really isn't a single dominant note in this rub, it's a balance of cardamom, smoked paprika, garlic, and even (I suspect) cinnamon. I'd advise people who want to kick things up a notch to add a dash of cayenne or black pepper.<br /><br />This works very well on lamb, chicken, and (surprisingly!) fish such as catfish or snapper.  Tends to be lackluster on red meats and fish like tuna and salmon.<br /><br />Only the two standout mixes that Chef Tom sells: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTHI"">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Salmon Rub</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTL4"">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Chicken Rub</a> are better than this one, mostly due to their extra versatility."
1,"I was first introduced to the Rub with Love products through the Salmon rub, which is one of my favorites.  When my local store stopped carrying it, I looked it up on Amazon, I was pleased to find the whole line of rubs.<br /><br />My favorite use of the Bengal Masala Rub is when roasting root vegetables in the oven.  It's also great on baked chicken."
1,"This is the tastiest spice!  I mix it with olive oil, rub it on boneless chicken breasts and cook for about 30 -45 minutes, then serve with hot or sweet mango chutney, everyone raves about it!  Has a little bite to it, also good on mild fish.  Don't pass this one up!"
1,"We have used Tom Douglas' rubs for years now.  I first found them at a winery on the east side of Washington state.  Nice to see them available on Amazon with the free shipping.  I love the masala, I cook with chicken breast, with ginger and cilantro, remove chicken, then add either coconut milk or 1/2n1/2 with chicken broth (also some cashews sauted in sesame oil on the side).  I agree with the other reviewer not too spicy but lots of flavor.<br /><br />For more spicy hot, I use the Tokoyo rub in my steak fajitas and use the Peri Peri on chicken cooked on the grill for spicy chicken sandwiches."
1,"You get a ton of pretzels in this bag, and it is allergy friendly! Perfect for my son with allergies, and all his non-allergy friends love them, too! Great for a snack at school or on the way to practice. I'd highly recommend these pretzels in any form, but I love the mini bags for convenience now that my son is older."
1,"My 1 and 3 yr old boys brought these home from day care.  My husband and I tried them and ate them all up!  I'm not really a pretzel fan but these don't taste so ""yeasty"" and actually have a slight sweet flavor.  The 1oz bag is a perfect size; you get a lot in this one bag!  Really good and am looking to buy these to take to work for a healthy snack."
1,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019Z6ES2"">Redbarn Bully Stick 35 Count 7 inch</a><br /><br />Malcolm, our rescue Cairn Terrier (the HAIRIER terrier) loves to chew. I mean REALLY REALLY REALLY loves to chew. He doesn't go after ""hard targets"" like wood furniture, but he did destroy the ""mattress"" in his dog bed. He is trying to figure out how to chew our cats without hurting them. They do not like his experimentation.<br />Found Bully Bones at a Petco, he was on the first one, dashed off to a defensible corner, and chewed his silly head off!! (Not literally.) But when he starts trying to chew the cats, we know his stick is gone, and he needs another one. So I buy them in bulk.<br />Did I mention he has BEAUTIFUL teeth - vet said keep letting him chew them. There is nothing here to clean."
1,"Aegean olive oil from Kalamata olives has a wonderful nutty flavor. There is no bitterness, even when the oil is not used quickly. My family loves it in salad dressing, pasta dishes and especially as a dipping oil with cracked pepper and wonderful Greek bread. Great price..well worth the money. Enjoy!"
0,"The actual product is fine.  It's recommended by my vet and I gobble it up daily.  I prefer my owner's food but she's stingy with it so I have no choice.  I even enjoy it at times.  My human was thrilled to order it in Feb 2009 and have it show up on our doorstep (no hauling of heavy bag in and out of car) and it was actually slightly cheaper than if she'd bought it from our local pet megalomart chain store.  I don't like the megalomart all that much.  The floors are slippery and they make my nervous.  But then again, I do like to watch the ferrets.  Oh, little ferret, squeeze your squirmy body of of that glass case. I want to play with you soooooo badly......<br />Anyway... my human went to re-order and the price has jumped by $3 and the shipping and handling went from $6.49 to $19.01.  Her yelp of horror scared me out of sound sleep.  I was dreaming of open fields and frisky ferrets.  ""Seriously?"" she screeched? ""The total price jumped from $41.62 to $57.50 in two months time?""  She's on a rant.  She's going back to the pet megalomart because she can haul her own bag of food for that price.  Oh, all you fine wee ferrets, get ready, I'm coming to seeeeee yooooouuuuuuu!!"
1,"I've been using barley and wheat grass juice for about 20 years. I use to grow a lot of it myself, juice it, and drink it. In recent years I have travelled extensively and don't have the circumstances for growing and juicing barley/wheat grass. (from this point on I'll simply refer to barley grass, although all statements also apply to wheat grass).<br /><br />In recent years I have watched a multitude of cheap barley/wheat grass powders make their way onto the market. Please note that most of these products are, in my opinion, next to useless. They are made from whole dried barley/wheat grass--cellulose and all. The primary concept of having barley/wheat grass is to have the juice, free of the almost indigestible cellulose fibre of the leaf. All the early research on the many benefits of barley grass was from ingesting the pure, fresh juice. Then a process was developed (in Japan, as far as I am aware) to spray dry the juice whilst keeping most of the enzymes and nutrients intact. That processed involved using using simple sugars as a medium to help the juice turn to powder. The result is a high quality product, but one that is not pure juice powder.<br /><br />Fast forward many years, and I come across the grass juice products from Pure Planet. As you will see from my review on <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011DRYF4"">Just Barley - Organic Barley Juice - 80 gram - Powder</a> I give it five stars.<br /><br />Having used 5 or so jars of this product from Now Foods I have to say the product seems identical enough that I can't tell the difference. However, Now Foods gives you 118 grams for (currently) around $20 on Amazon. The Pure Planet product on Amazon is (currently) around $14 to $15. When you do the math, the Now Foods product is almost half the price.<br /><br />Obviously the many barley grass powders (not JUICE powder) as going to be a lot cheaper, but I really don't think it's worth it. Much of the nutrients in those powders are still going to be bound up in hard-to-digest cellulose, and they are far less concentrated. I've tried a few and they taste pretty poor and don't give me the lift I get from JUICE powder."
1,"Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile.  I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice."
1,I sometimes make my own horseradish mayo. But this is ready anytime and adds a zest I love to sandwiches. Very happy with this product.
1,"Not only is this great on sandwiches and roast beef, this is hands-down the best ready prepared dipping sauce for sweet potato fries!  I have not seen any attempt by Kraft to mass market these specialty mayos and I wish they would.  I would hate to see a great product disappear from the shelves because of a poor marketing strategy."
0,"I had purchased the product before from local supermarket but have had a hard time locating - was glad to find it on amazon - but when received - all 6 jars show a ""best used by May 2011"" - a 2 month period.  Much shorter than I would have expected for a ""lot"".  Will try and find a local supplier to avoid this problem in the future."
1,"I would give it a 4.5 if the grading system would allow. Taste bud friendly: I love a dark and oily bean and this one satisfies the foodie in me. Pocket book friendly: Buying bulk beans and using super saver helps save money. Environmentally friendly: This last Earth Day I learned about the importance of shade grown coffee; buying it is one small thing I can do to have a positive effect on the environment. Although these are not listed as shade grown beans, after contacting the company I've learned that they are. I like that I can save money, satisfy my foodie nature, and help the environment."
1,"The beans are large and evenly roasted, with no ""quakers"" --the runty, wizened bits that Cook's Illustrated determined are the cause of that truck-stop coffee flavor. It's organic, and has a nice rich smooth dark taste that isn't burned at all."
1,We spent several months trying various organic coffees that amazon.com sells. There were two that were our favorites. This is one of them. It is not acid and it has a wonderful flavor.
1,"Buying direct from Amazon via a monthly subscription has ensured that this coffee arrives quickly and in the freshest condition possible. Oh, and did I mention that it is $5.00 cheaper than anywhere else?  And free shipping to boot!  Wonderful bistro flavor is now possible in my own home with this fabulous, rich, organic coffee. I am a die hard coffee snob and this is simply the best brew out there in my humble opinion!"
0,"My taste runs to a bold Dark Roast, with lots of flavor- i.e. Cafe Altura Dark Roast Peruvian/Sumatran.<br /><br />This is a bland/tasteless Breakfast type blend, with no distinctive flavor (2 rounded tbs per 6oz)- i.e. Folgers Classic.<br /><br />I like to switch around to different Organic beans (no burn-out), and was hoping to add this to the list?- NOT!<br /><br />Now I'm stuck using these beans up."
1,A great value on subscribe and save and great flavor! This is a superb organic coffee.
1,This is a very fine coffee indeed.  The roast is not too dark not too light.  I believe the beans are from Chiapas Mexico and have a very clean effect.  I don't get all jittery and sweaty like some other coffee beans do to me.  Highly recommended.
1,"I like dark roasts.  I like a strong cup of coffee - as strong as it can be without tasting burnt or bitter.  I like this better than comparable roasts I have bought from Starbuck's, Tully's and Millstone.  It's really, really good."
1,"EXCELLENT dark roast coffee.  It compares with the expensive brands - and you can't beat the price.  We are a bit on the ""coffee snob"" side, so I am happy to have found coffee that we love that is affordable."
1,"I bought a pod coffee maker because I was wasting whole pots of coffee just to have one cup.  I never thought I'd be dissatisfied with the pods.  Heres's what I think - if you can see through the coffee, it's not coffee - it's tea.  These Buzzworthy pods are great, and I think they're comparable to Starbucks - which is, in my opinion, a good thing."
1,"I'm from Greece and there's no such thing as ""instant greek coffee"". There seems to be a confusion among reviewers between ""frappe"" and ""greek aka turkish coffee"", we are talking about two completely different kinds of coffee. To make frappe,which is cold coffee, you can use ANY KIND of instant coffee, add cold water, milk (if you want), and ice cubes,shake and serve in a tall glass. To make traditional greek aka turkish coffee (the one served in a small cup like espresso) you need a DIFFERENT TYPE OF COFFEE (eg Loumidis papagalos greek coffee). This kind of coffee is made by adding coffee, sugar (if you want) and water in a tiny boiling pan (called ibrik) and slowly bring it to a boil until the coffee rises. Nescafe classico is a very nice coffee, but it's totally different than the traditional greek/turkish coffee.It can only be used for cold frappe or hot instant, NOT traditional greek coffee."
1,"Perfect for a classic Frappe! Enjoy. Make sure you purchase the coffee packed in Greece, as others are different and will alter the taste of a classic Greek iced Frappe or hot Ness."
1,"I've been looking for a decent instant coffee, and since I like Greek coffee, decided to give this a try.  Long story short, it's not bad stuff -- but since I don't read Greek, it's taken a lot of experimentation with amounts to get the amounts right.  I find that if I don't use enough of the instant granules, I get a thin acidic cup, so I personally use about two tablespoons per cup of hot water.<br /><br />Remember that this is intended to taste like strong Greek coffee, not drip-brew, and is best taken with sugar, no cream.  I normally take my coffee black, but this doesn't taste quite right to me without a little sugar."
1,Great item. Tastes fantastic and smooth. Perfect for the tea enthusiast! I will buy again. The package also reseals easily.
1,"This is a strong, quality mate.  The mint flavor is faint, perhaps due to the use of spearmint instead of stronger peppermint (a personal preference).  Yet it's just enough to add a pleasant, cooling effect to the mate bitterness and earthiness."
0,"Was not worth buying. Prepared according to directions and ended up in the trash. Batter was extremely thick, the bread did not rise and had no taste to it.  Now I'm stuck with the remaining three which I'll need to figure out how to doctor the recipe in order to have better luck next time.  I can make much better pumpkin bread from scratch using my own recipe."
0,"If you need a brick that tastes like flour, is heavy enough to keep the car from rolling, and has no taste, color, or smell of pumpkin or spice, buy this mix. It was quite a disappointment. I made two loaves, just in case the first was a fluke and the second was worse than the first."
0,I tried 2 of 4 in the bread machine and both came out like uncooked dough.  I couldn't find an expiration date on the packages.  Could have been old or just a bad product.
1,"The package suggests adding nuts, raisins, grated carrots and coconut.  I added only pecans and raisins.  The next time I will try the other suggestions.  The bread is very good, just sweet and spicy enough.  I ordered more."
0,"I considered buying these in bulk here on Amazon, then realized that i would be over paying! The very same bars are $3 for a box of 8... to get 48 bars, would would be spending $18, instead of $22+ (shipping, tax, etc). Plus, then i can choose the variety of flavors we want, not what is pre-boxed. While some of the bulk items here are a deal, many are not!"
1,"Having 3 athletic teens, we're always feeding them and their friends.  Better than chips and candy bars to ward off their munchies and cravings, we subscribe to a frequent delivery of a case of these from Amazon to get an even better price, and keep our closet stocked with bars like this instead of junk foods.  Our kids grab these in the morning on the way too school, keep them tucked in their backbacks for quick nibble-fixes during the day, and if their friends come over after school or if they have team events to go to and have a quick hunger attack.  These are handy and filling, and a great Amazon Prime value."
1,"My son is not a breakfast eater at ALL. He hates to<br />eat anything in the morning. I tried everything<br />and he finally will eat these. It is nice because<br />then he can eat them in the car or on the way to the<br />bus. And if he doesn't finish it, no big deal, like it<br />was when I would get up half an hour early to make him<br />a breakfast sandwich. ;) These are a great price for the<br />amount of bars, and taste wonderful, too!"
1,"These Nutri-Grain Kellogg's Cereal Bars aren't as horrible as you'd expect.  In fact they actually taste pretty good.  No, nothing will ever be able to replicate an actual bowl of cereal on a hungry Monday morning, but when you're late for work and having trouble getting the kids out the door and to the bus stop in time, you can count on a nice healthy cereal bar as a worthwhile alternative.  These are significantly more delicious than pop tarts too.  I never understood the appeal of pop tarts- whether in a toaster or eating cold, they still taste horrendous.  Cereal bars -especially these ones- are much better.  Your tastebuds will thank you... and thank me for the recommendation, haha."
1,"48 pack is nice, and the variety is great! A good healthy choice for snacks. Since I don't have a Sam's club membership, buying off of amazon was an excellent idea."
1,I like the taste. It is not that nutritious as one would think as it has high fructose corn syrup but it is still better than eating lots of candy or chips for snack. I keep it in my office and eat it on the days when I forgot to carry a snack.
1,"Nothing surprising here. The product arrived on time and is what I had expected. Also, it was a good deal."
1,I love these soft delicious fruit bars in the morning with my tea--this was more economical to buy in bulk--being a prime member I also had no shipping cost...
1,Brought these for my grandson and he loved them. They received them fast and were freash and not outdated or ready to expire.
1,"The products came in timely manner, fresh and packaging was in good condition. Which is important to me."
1,"These are great, my kids love them and so do I! I got them on sale here for about $ 13 with free prime shipping! Great Deal! Also they were fresh and within expiration"
1,I love these things. And I love getting a big box so that I don't have to spend $1 for each one in the vending machine at work. Good stuff.
0,I hope that Kelloggs stops trying to save $.01 cent by using High Fructose instead of sugar and gets out of bed with the US Corn Industry.
0,"Do not bother buying this product. It is processed food. The definition of unhealthiness, it does not fill you up at all. It makes you feel sick after wards. America does not need to be any fatter than it already is, so please go to the grocery store and buy something healthy for your kids."
1,Freeze the concentrate in ice cube trays.  Put 4 cubes in a blender with 1 TBS powdered plain yogurt.  Add milk to cover cubes and blend.  OUTSTANDING!!
1,This is the best flavor that Dr. Smoothie makes. All of the flavors are good and natural but this one is the best. Great taste of pineapple and a hint of coconut!
1,"Zoe is made from big fat olives that are meaty and buttery tasting. When my husband and I went to the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company in Pittsburgh, PA, the olive oil buyer guided us through our first olive oil purchase. She had us eat the olives that went into different kinds of olive oil and then pick the olives we liked best. Our first purchase of Zoe was the result. It is an olive oil with a distinctly buttery taste. I use it in baking cakes whenever oil or melted butter is called for. It tastes great! Absolutely great! Plus, it's heart healthy, which butter is not. Sigh. Other olives, particularly Italian olives that are made into olive oil are very peppery. Hence, their oil is peppery. This might be what other people are talking about when they say they don't like Zoe. Zoe is not a bit peppery. So please, you must try for yourself in this case. It is not a good idea to take anyone else's product review for olive oil to heart. (a pun!) You must decide what you like in an olive oil and buy according. Also, I want to mention that the buttery taste stays there even through a saute. We bought different types of Italian olive oil in smaller bottles that same first time at the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company, and then we came home and made fried eggs with all of them. In that venue the taste of the olive oils really came through and Zoe kept that buttery taste. Good eating!"
1,"I have tried a lot of olive oils in the past, and being on a tight budget, I try to stay in the lower price range category. As you can imagine, I've ended up with some really lacking oils. Not so with Zoe Organic! This olive oil is light and mild with an excellent clean taste that doesn't overpower the flavor of what you're cooking (I like that in an olive oil!). Perfect for salad dressings, sauteing, baking, etc. There's nothing I wont use this oil in. Another plus is the size, no more trying to find a cabinet space tall enough for a tall bottle of oil. I've finally found an affordable winner!"
1,The EVOO is as tasty as described in other reviews. I thought I'd comment on the container. It is hard to open at best. The green pouring spout is accessed by pulling a ring pull which is very hard to pry up. Then it takes considerable pulling to expand the pour spout. The cap then unscrews however it is very hard to pour without a large amount of residue accumulating on the top of the container.<br />I recommend the oil but also recomment decanting it into another container or pouring bottle.
0,"I bought this olive oil since it was organic, and went through 6 (750 mL) cans on a subscription, but in the end I decided to stop buying it. I bought this oil to be my basic mid-priced olive oil primarily for sauteing. I like all sorts of olive oil -- from soft and buttery to peppery and green. This oil has a heavy woody scent, not as fragrant as other good EVOO in this price range. Sampled uncooked, the oil has mild initial taste, not much olive flavor at all, but not unpleasant, but what I didn't like is its harsh after-taste. It was not good in salad dressings. With other flavorings, the harshness is muted but still remains. In cooked dishes any olive oil flavor mostly disappears. In the same price range, I've had better luck with obscure Spanish or Greek 1 L cans of EVOO from the supermarket."
1,"I usually use Bariani of California, and that stuff is like GOLD.  You could sip it from a spoon, no kidding.  But there is no way would I ruin the delicate flavor by heating it or cooking with it.  So I tried Zoe Organic EVOO, really not expecting much, hoping it would be ""good enough"" for baking and stir-frying.  I was really pleasantly surprised!  It is stronger than I'm used to, but still mild enough to not overpower things like pie crusts and cookies.  I am back to renew my subscription for this great, all purpose EVOO!"
1,"The price and quality of this product are both fantastic. I love that the dark, tin container greatly protects the taste and integrity of the oil (versus the typical glass bottle). However, there is an inherent problem with the pouring spout. It is plastic and very short. This leads to oil dripping on the top during usage, which is both wasteful and messy. If the manufacturer would alter that one component, this would be the perfect organic olive oil."
1,Good stuff -- but make sure you have a bottle to decant into. You will just make a mess if you try to pour from this container.
1,"I like that the Zoe olive oil comes in the metal containers, as opposed to plastic.  The packaging was good; there was not the slightest dent in either can.<br /><br />But there's the BPA thing.  Buying organic, you'd like to know there's not any bpa in the lining of the can, lurking there for months, canceling out part of the benefit of organic.  If Zoe does not tell us, we have to assume the bpa is there, as in other canned foods.  I did a casual search but wasn't able to find out anything specific for Zoe on this. The same casual search turned up many questions about bpa, no definitive answers.<br /><br />I did find a 2003 government sponsored scientific study --- [...] that found BPA was taken up by (absorbed into) olive oil in greater amounts than either water or 3% acetic acid!  Apparently, BPA links with lipid molecules very easily.<br /><br />Why can't we be sure, 8 years later, that BPA isn't leaching into food?  Unfortunately, I found that study link AFTER I'd bought these two tins, so the only thing to do is tranfer contents into glass and refrigerate.  I always keep olive oil refrigerated after opening anyway, in spite of the inconvenience when it solidifies and you have to pour warm water over the container to get it to pour.<br /><br />There's the pouring problem...  I'd read reviews beforehand, so I knew that you had to pull on the green tab to raise the plastic spout.  However, I usually don't pour much at one time, so am still getting a bit of dribble onto the top of the can.  So the plastic spout isn't working for me.  I'm considering glass containers such as the Global Amici drizzlers, just for pouring; this must be a common problem with olive oil.<br /><br />I can't detect anything buttery about Zoe Organic's taste.  And it's not as olive-like a taste as Colavita, for example.<br /><br />Next time, organic or not, I'll try something else for more flavor and to use as a dipping oil.  I'd consider the Zoe special varieties, but apparently they come in plastic containers, with no BPA disavowal in the descriptions.  With so many plastic items being imported from places with little manufacturing controls, it's not sure that any disavowal could be trusted, anyway."
1,"Was looking for a real good olive oil,just happened upon Zoe.Has to be the best oil I have tasted.So rich and beautiful as a good oil should be. Also like that it is from Spain .Have read how good their oils are ,have to say its true.Love it.Cant beat the price on AMAZON."
0,"Amazon just cancelled the 1L 2-pack of this good oil via subscribe & save @ 18.71 for my last shipment. That is 67 oz's of oil. Now it's 51 oz's for 22$ in subscribe & save, that is an increase from 0.28$ per OZ to 0.43$ per oz -- about 30% increase in price. Not anywhere as good a deal as it was before. This is good middle of the road, organic olive oil, been using it for last 2-3 years. But it's getting way to pricey for what it is.<br /><br />Maybe it's not Amazon - maybe it's the supplier price increase -- but it is a sad turn of events.<br /><br />Just read a bunch of articles about how low olive oil prices are hurting europe -- sounds like gouging to me."
1,"The only other olive oil I can compare this to is ""Filippo Berio"" from the supermarket. I did a smell and taste test comparing these two oils. The supermarket stuff smelled awful and nothing like olives, while the Zoe had a nice olive scent to it. The supermarket stuff tasted nothing like olives while the Zoe did.<br /><br />Not a great comparison, but definitely a good buy if you can get it on sale or with coupons."
1,"I have been using olive oil for many years, even in sweet baked goods.  A couple of years ago the New Yorker magazine contained an article exposing all of the problems with Italian olive oils in recent years.  So I decided to switch to a Spanish olive oil, preferably organic.  Zoe ended up being my choice, mostly based on price and its fairly middle of the road flavor.  I have now been using it for about five years and remain satisfied.  It is not the best olive oil around, but it is consistently good and not priced so high as to cause pain.  I have not had problems with it going rancid.  I like the tin, but am still careful to keep it in a cool area rather than near the stove.  Once I have used half of the can's contents I prefer to decant the rest into a smaller, dark glass container.  I can't say that I love the spigot, but once I figured out how to pull it out I have had no problems.  The product stays in the tin or pours nicely into the dish or pot I am using when cooking.  I have not had any counter messes nor do I find a lot of oil around the spigot.  Finally, I like being able to buy through Amazon's subscribe and save program, which makes this oil a bit more economical to use."
1,"This was a pretty good olive oil.  I tried just dipping my bread in it to see the full flavor and this is my conclusion, even thought I freely admit I am no expert or anything.  First thing I noticed was the viscosity of it, pretty thin.  I don't know if that is good or bad, just an observation.  I figure this is good for salads, and didn't have too much effect on me dipping bread, but would rather have it a bit thick.  The flavor was good, not great.  It didn't have the rich fruity, nutty flavor I was hoping for, but was OK.  I had been using Pompeian and think I prefer its flavor better, at least in dipping.  After I use this up I will go back to Pompeian, its cheap at wmart and to me has the best flavor of any I have tried.  Conclusion is if you want a thin, light oil then this is a good choice, for a more robust flavor, there are better options."
1,Very buttery and rich. A wonderful oil for the price. Especially like the fact that it's organic. Wish there were an expiration date on the can.
1,"I lived in sicily for over a year and I have had the best olive oil known to man.  Once back stateside trying to find something even remotely comparable is near impossible.  Then I found this.....So far it is the best I have been able to find over here.  Light, perfect, great flavor.  I will continue to use this for all my olive oil needs."
1,"I am getting this regularly via subscribe and save option and I must say this is a pretty good deal given the quality of the product. Although the taste difference in organic vs regular Zoe oils is subtle, I like to believe going organic is good for me. If you know much about or have used olive oils regularly, you'd love the taste of this particular extra virgin olive oil. Apart from being healthy this is full flavored - real extra virgin and not diluted like many store brands- and comes in a can to protect the oil from exposure to direct sun light. Go for it, with free shipping, you can't go wrong."
1,"We use this olive for everything; marinades, saut&eacute;' and dressings.  Very solid flavour and texture."
1,"I HAVE STARTED TO USE OLIVE OIL FOR HEALTH PROBLEMS, TRIED MANY OTHERS, ZOE IS THE ONLY OLIVE OIL I HAVE FOUND THAT IS MELLOW AND SMOOTH TO ME. FOR THE VALUE YOU CANT FIND BETTER,  JUST GIVE IT A TRY. I HAVE USED OIL FOR ABOUT A YEAR , I USE ABOUT 6 TABLE SPOONS EACH DAY. SKIN IS SMOOTH , HAIR LOOKS BETTER , FEEL BETTER. I AM 83 YRS YOUNG  AND I NEED ALL THE HELP I CAN GET."
1,Zoe is an excellent cooking oil and the metal container promotes its integrity for long shelf life.<br />It is also useful for other processes calling for olive oil.
1,"works well for cooking, but prefer a better tasting not so bitter one for salads, etc...still a good value especially on subscribe and save."
1,"would have given 5 stars, but the tin spout is poorly designed and the precious oil spills all over the place!"
1,"It's of high quality, but the usage of the lid needs more instruction for the new customer.<br />I messed it up and it will leaks a little bit every time after use. A small card of instruction on how to open the lid is helpful."
1,"Love this stuff. I use it for everything from cooking, to salad dressings, to dipping my (gluten-free) bread in. It has a rich texture. I love that it is full-bodies, yet not overpowering. For the price, it is an excellent oil for being organic. I buy it through subscribe and save. I will continue to buy it. Not only is it good flavored, and a good value, but I can easily fit it on my shelf."
0,"I am pretty upset about the recent pricing change on this product. I have been buying this for years and have had this on S&S for sometime.  My S&S was recently cancelled by Amazon at the same time it was suppose to ship (hence i ran out of Olive Oil).  I went on to re-order the product and thought at the time it was cancelled due to Amazon Frustration Free Packaging (yes I should have paid closer attention to the ounces when re-bought)however to my dismay when opening the package today the tins were HALF the size than the old ones.  So basically I am thinking ok - I wont be buying this brand again, I'll have to find a new one. Now I am even more upset as I just came on here to write a review and when I search Zoe Olive Oil - the 1 Liter tins came up - but are no longer on S&S <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0060JNAE8"">Zoe Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 1 Liter Tins (Pack of 2)</a> and they are 50 cents more than the 25.5 ounce 2 Pack on S&S.  These are basically a rip off now.  I hate to leave a negative product review about something that I like, but this one bothered me so much I felt completed to inform other consumers about the recent changes."
1,"This is the only olive oil I buy anymore!  Good price, quick shipping, great taste, and the tin keeps it fresh for a long time.  Will continue to buy this product."
1,"I have used the Zoe Olive Oil for some time, and cannot or will not do without it..I have even shared with family and friends to get them to use it also..Keep up the great job.."
1,"We only use olive oil, peanut oil, and grass fed butter for our fats. I have been using Zoe organic olive oil for several years now. When I first started buying it from Amazon the packing was not so great and cans were frequently dented. New packing works wonderful and no more dented cans. Zoe olive oil works wonderful for baking and general purpose needs. It makes great homemade mayo. For the quantity we use the price is right. I use it in salad dressings also and it tastes just fine."
1,"This is great for cooking and gift giving.  I like that it's in cans, takes less space, and is organic.  Not the best I've had, but for daily use and cooking it's great.<br />I have it on subscribe and save every 4-6 months or so.  I live alone, so they last a long time.  I use olive oil, coconut oil, almond oil, for everything . . . I don't use butter or other oils anymore.<br /><br />Great product, well packaged for shipping, since Amazon likes to just toss things in a box without protecting anything.  This company thinks ahead, and the cans are very well protected for shipping.<br /><br />They are much smaller than they seem on the computer,  because of the shape, I guess.  Still a great value, even though they raise the price every order by about $2.00, so I probably will be shopping for another brand by next order.."
1,"This is a terrific olive oil. I am pretty picky with EVOO, and often buy higher priced stuff. I admit to pouring it into a class olive oil container for easier use, but it's well worth the small effort. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes quality olive oil at a terrific price!"
1,I have used lots of brand for the olive oil. I love the salad and cook with olive oil.<br />This one is very reach and good quality for all kinds of food.<br />I have seen reviews and I didn't regret buying this brand oil.<br />I strongly recommend this product and the price also is very reasonable.
1,"This olive oil has a nice, subtle flavor. No acidic ""bite"" like you may taste from some cheap Italian or Greek olive oils. Great for salads and mixing with herbs for dipping bread. Not a bad price for an organic, either."
1,"Very good quality olive oil. Not to heavy, gives fried food a great taste. I also use in my brownies works great"
1,"I have read that olives are a heavily pesticided crop, so switched to organic evoo. This Brand, on subscribe and save, is the best priced organic evoo I have found. My one complaint is the spout, which tends to spill. I transfer it into a bottle, to minimize the waste."
1,I am very pleased with this product. It's taste good. The little sit back is the tin itself. You have to pour the oil in an other bottle or will have a mess every time.
1,I first purchased this brand of olive oil after tasting it at a wine and cheese shop. It has a great flavor and I paid three times as much for it. It's beautiful tin also makes it a great gift.
1,The taste is great. I like it. But the cover is not good. It is easy to spread some oil on the top of the cover when open it.
1,I order this oil via subscribe and save - I chose it because of the convenient size and because it is organic. It has a slightly bitter/sharp flavor that makes it too strong for some applications but I use it for all my salad dressings and cooking and have not looked around for any other for many months.
1,"Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil is a lighter, less intense extra virgin olive oil - the fact that it is organic is an added plus.  This oil is perfect for multiple uses such as dipping, baking, and incorporating into dressings and sauces which require oil.  It is also the perfect introduction for those individuals who are new to using olive oil since the olive (fruity) taste is less pronounced than it is in other EVOO's (Extra Virgin Olive Oils).  My spouse is one of those individuals who was encouraged by the cardiologist to switch to olive oil, but who did not like its taste.  That is until, after reading the reviews on Amazon, I purchased Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  It is the first in a long line of EVOO's that has met with his approval.<br /><br />Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil is light and has a buttery taste.  One can add herbs to the oil for extra flavor; it does not overpower their taste.  Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil is excellent for adding to baked goods which call for oil.  Its mild flavor does not compete with the taste of other ingredients; there is no fruity aftertaste.  Personally, I did notice a peppery bite in my throat after using this oil as a dip, without the addition of either herbs or pepper.  The aftertaste was not particularly strong and was not evident when the oil was combined with balsamic vinegar or herbs.  Amazon's price for Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil is excellent; it is far better than the cost of better EVOO's at the warehouse stores.<br /><br />This is a five-star product packaged in a three-star container.  The spout is difficult to pull out completely; pouring the oil can be a challenge.  The spout on the first can I opened was defective and split at the base when it was pulled out.  I did not notice this until I began to pour the oil and ended up with a puddle on the countertop.  Amazon's customer service was excellent with respect to resolving that issue.  I do like the size of the can which is easy to handle.  Unlike other EVOO's, Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil does not specify in which region of its country of origin the olives are grown, nor does it specify the year of harvest.  Further, unless the date is coded, the can does not indicate a best-used-by date.<br /><br />Despite these minor issues, this is a fine EVOO and I recommend it to anyone looking for a lighter, less intensely flavored EVOO.  You can't go wrong purchasing Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil from Amazon."
0,"I bought this because it was such a good deal, but it went rancid so quickly I will not buy it again."
1,"I'm sure I'll reorder this product.  I cook quite a bit with Olive Oil...everything from Veggies, to Pancakes, to Burgers, and Steaks.  For cooking, it's tasty without any suprises.  Raw out of the bottle it has a bit of taste/zing to the back of the throat... a bit of burn.  That is entirely natural, and due to a naturally occuring penolic chemical in Olive Oil called Oleocanthal.  If your olive oil doesn't zing or burn the back of your throat, then it probably is a washed out, watered down version of the real deal.  Zoe has done a superb job here with Organic Oil at reasonable price.  Choose Zoe Organic, and be happy.  I recently read an article about a vinyard in Italy that had some 500 Olive trees.  Due to weather conditions, roughly half produced annually.  Many of the trees were over 250 years old.  Olive trees live 500-900 years, and some in Syria are as old as 1,500 years.  Anyways, the point is this.  With a crop of 500 trees, rough weather can produce 300 liters of pure organic olive oil.  The average tree in normal conditions will produce about 4 lieters of oil.  The current price you see for something like this Zoe Organic product is a steal."
1,"I grabbed this on a special because it was such a good price for a quality olive oil. When I first tasted it, I was somewhat disappointed, because it had a strong ""green"" flavor, like the olives hadn't fully ripened. I relegated it to cooking and foods that it would be mixed in with, like hummus. Over time, I have grown to like it more, and now occasionally even use it for drizzling on salads and other foods where the olive oil's flavor is a stand-out part of the dish.<br /><br />I usually drizzle a little EVOO on top of hummus when I serve it along with kalamata olives, feta cheese, tzatziki and tabbouleh. Mmm, one of my favorite meals! I use the Zoe when I make the hummus, then use my favorite <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BFG56A"">'Nunez del Prado' Flor de Aceite Olive Oil Glass by La Tienda</a>, for the drizzle. I have bought it in a 1 Liter tin at my local upscale grocery store, but it is more expensive than the Zoe. I discovered Nunez de Prado when I asked them to let me have an olive oil tasting (like a wine tasting), and this one was by far my personal favorite.<br /><br />The special addition you get by drizzling the oil over many different foods really adds a lot of dimension and flavor, so you really want to get one that you love.<br /><br />The spout is messy no matter how I hold the can, so I decant it in into a glass bottle (store it in a dark cabinet).<br /><br />Bottom line: I would definitely recommend this oil for the price, it is very good quality, though it's not my favorite."
1,"If Amazon does not smash it with their lame packing ideas, this is good stuff.  If you would rather support some good American olive growers, look up BARI in California. I alternate between them both."
1,I love the size of these cans because one can easily decants into my glass bottle for daily use.  The remaining can stores the oil better than if it were in a bottle so it works out nicely.  I recommend it!
1,"I bought this on ""Special"" and am so glad I did.  It has a wonderful strng Olive taste.  Exactly what I was looking for."
1,"This is my second pack this year. We all love the taste and texture. Mainly we use this oil for salad dressings and cooking in cast iron, which brings out the aroma as well. Great product for the price and quality."
1,"This olive oil is so good. It's light and buttery. I will never buy another kind of evoe again. The price at amazon is good, too."
1,"We have used several olive oils, this one is very nice. I stopped my automatic delivery when the price was automatically increased. Anyone that I have given this to as a gift, also enjoyed it."
1,"Seriously,  I like this product a lot, and think it better than those recommended in the Cook's Classic Best Recipe series cookbooks:  Davinci; Pompeian, and Colavita!<br /><br />The smaller cans are a bit of a pain, but I do get to lick my (compulsively washed) fingers.<br /><br />My favorite artesanal EVOO is Il Borro from Tuscany - I'll be there for the last 7 nights in March and plan to return with as much as I can carry.  It is very floral/fruity with a hint of rich spicy herbs, and a bit of a bite on the finish - great stuff!<br /><br />Provecho."
1,I subscribe to this product and really like it.  It has a good flavor and food cooks well in it.
1,"its olive oil...not much to say<br />trans fats free! high in antioxidants<br />great on pasta, bread, meat,<br />or even just as a dip with some spices<br />the fact that there were 2 made up for the small size<br />it was some real quality olive oil"
1,"We are very pleased with this product.  I like the packaging, they fit nicely into our pantry vs. the clumsy bottles we used to get at the supermarket.  The oil is flavorful and not bitter, a quality product for sure.  We will buy these from now on."
1,There must be hundreds of different Olive Oil brands out there.  Zoe has the best taste.  Cod fish fried in this oil taste better than any other oil.
1,"I am very happy with this purchase (and subscription).<br /><br />I usually make a salad every night to get my green leafies in and make a fresh evoo dressing.  The dressings are awesome with this brand.  I also use this oil for light saut&eacute;ing and have not noticed any unpleasant taste as described by one of the other reviewers.<br /><br />The subscription for this evoo is super because I use so much!  Good thing it is good for us.  :)<br /><br />Oh, my husband always fills my Rachael Ray evoo bottle from this tin and one tin fills it perfectly.  So I don't use it directly from the tin."
1,I am at a point in my life that due to health concerns I am going away from processed foods and trying to buy organic whenever I can. Amazon is making that very easy on me with this olive oil. When you purchase this item through subscribe and save it becomes the same price as non organic from the grocery store. I will definately purchase this again and again.
1,"This is a good tasting light olive oil, unlike others that are very heavy it is great on salads or for cooking. Would buy again."
0,"I could not belive the size of these tins for the price, so I ventured to measure the quantity since it didn't seem possible that the tins could possible hold 25.5 ounces in oil. Surely, the weight includes the weight of the tins which feels heavy enough to raise suspisions The quality was average and thus overpriced. Perhaps the fact that the oil is organic may due some justice. I will continue to do what I have been doing in the past and shop around.<br /><br />Update<br /><br />This oil is dangerous for frying in a pan, it splashes as if water was added to make this oil which would explain the lightness in texture. Disapointed that the container does not disclose that this is not pure oil and that water is being added."
1,"Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil brings out the best in food, whether you cook with it or use it in salads. When I first bought it, my wife complained that it was too expensive. But after a while she said that it was better tasting than any oil she had ever used and insisted that we reorder it.<br /><br />We use olive oil because we are concerned about our cholesterol. Just a little bit of Zoe is all that is needed to cook foods in an Orka steamer for delicious and healthy meals, microwaved in just minutes. We use it almost daily to make wonderful tasting, fish and vegetables that way. Chinese leftovers and rice tastes like it was freshly cooked when you reheat it this way with teaspoon of this oil.<br /><br />We recommend it highly!"
1,"For the price this olive oil is very good.  We use it all summer on our fresh salads (especially caprese!) and in addition to having a crisp flavor, it is very smooth with a slight sweetness.  Excellent with a good balsamic.  It is wonderful for cooking as well."
1,I bought the Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil because it was at a great price.  I like the fact that it is organic.  The style of the container does a wonderful job of avoiding spills.
1,"This is a great olive oil.  It is really low in price for its organic certification and the fact that it is first cold-pressed (first cold pressing yields a much more nutritious, flavorful oil).  Other olive oils that can make those claims often cost twice what Zoe does, or more.  As to flavor, it is soft, buttery, and a little bit sweet; it tastes like olive oil (sounds dumb, but many olive oils sacrifice their fundamental ""olive-ness"" to achieve a wider appeal).  On the other hand, it is not so strong as to overpower other flavors when you cook with it.  Great for roasting garlic, as a base for sauces, and for sauteeing vegetables.  The two small tins are a nice touch, too, as you get a decent amount of oil, but can keep it half of it sealed up for freshness."
1,"This olive oil so far is great. I love that it is in a tin so that I can leave it on the counter rather than having to place it in the cabinet.<br />However, it is best to put it into a carafe or olive oil dispenser because it can be quite difficult to pour and not spill.<br />As for the taste, it is very light and a bit nutty. Levels above many of the other oils at the same price level.<br />For the price, one should certainly try it out."
1,This olive oil is great.  I buy the organic and the regular Zoe olive oil on a regular basis.  I use it for all sorts of foods.  Another 'hard to find' product that's right here on Amazon.  Thanks!
1,For some reason I like this oil much more for cooking then straight on salads.  This Olive Oil is very good and a much better priced than at my supermarket. I like the idea that it is from Spain but originally thought it was from Italy. This gives you a different variety of nutrients and omegas that are healthy and nutritious.
1,"the quality of oil is great. I give it four stars because of the tin design. It is difficult to pour out the oil without it dripping leftovers on top.<br /><br />For those who haven't had real evoo, it might taste bitter at first- as a fresh oil will. I was initially surprised by the bitterness, but over time have appreciated it because it cuts down on the unctousness; works great with the acidity in vinegars for dressings or dipping bread. EVOO is very healthy and should be used raw if possible, only apply light heat to it. this isn't an oil for frying."
1,"This is my over all FAV olive oil!  its just strong enough and pure enough to go into everything without over powering, but at the same time is awesome alone as the ""flavor ingredient"" I never find it bitter or week in anything I cook."
1,"High quality, organic extra virgin olive oil with a great rich taste at a great price, nothing more nothing less.  I recommend the product to all who enjoy olive oil with the added benefit of organics."
1,I found this on DealNews and applied for the subscription to get a discount. Well I forgot about it and it was auto-shipped but that's okay. The oil is really tasty and I feel better knowing it's organic.
1,This seems like a good product. We buy a lot of organic food and the price was reasonable for the olive oil.
1,"No question as to the integrity and quality of the olive oil. Dip, sautee, Momma Mia !!<br />And... a wonderful bonus:<br />These tins are adorable, and sized for decor.<br />They add a touch of color to your kitchen -and stay within easy reach.<br />Good stuff and adorable too!<br />I subscribed for an irresistable price."
1,The opening on this container is perfect for keeping the container clean and free from drips and spills. There is a plastic spout that pops up when the tin is opened and this allows the oil to flow free away from a neck.<br /><br />The amount that comes out at once is slower compared to most oil bottles and tins and this is another feature I enjoy about this tin. The size is compact and easy to handle.
1,"I was that guy who always just bought a massive jug of extra virgin olive oil at whatever price I thought was decent. I had been getting the massive Bertolli jug at Sam's and thought that was pretty much the be all end all of olive oil. Man, I was wrong. I just accepted the fact that olive oil had a funky and unpleasant after taste.<br /><br />On a lark, I picked a few tins of the Zoe Organic when it was selling for $13.65 per two. This stuff is awesome. Great soft, mild taste that doesn't have the slimey and chemical flavor that most other olive oils have tried. I'm not an exceptional taster by any means, so I can't say it tasted like roses, or buttermilk or pepper or anything else. It's just good.<br /><br />I was a bit surprised at the small size of the tins. It isn't as big or as much oil as I pictured, but the sealed and dark tins should help it keep fresh for much longer. I don't think the price or quality can be beat."
1,"I just got this today and haven't had the chance to use it, but I love the packaging. This is super cute and perfect to keep on the counter. From all the reviews I'm going to like the product as well. I'm having this delievered every six months, but I think I may need to make it more frequent.<br /><br />I have since used this oil and I like it. I bought it mostly because it was organic. The light green color is lovely and the taste isn't overpowering. Excellent oil for the price. Buy it for your next extra virgin olive oil. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />All the other reviews mention pouring. I pour mine into another container and I haven't had that problem.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5UTM"">Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 25.5-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a>"
1,We use this Zoe Organic EVOO all the time and it doesn't disappoint. Amazon.com sells it at a great price and I get a few tins each year.
1,After returning from Italy I wanted to find a better one than I had been using.  This one is it!
1,This Olive Oil is very good and a much better price than my local source.<br />I like the idea that it is from Spain. This gives you a different  variety of nutrients.
0,"I love this oil, good flavor, love that it's organic, BUT the pour spout makes such a mess on the top of the tin that you have to wipe up & waste (1/2 teaspoon with every single pour) and sometimes even runs down the side of the tin that I won't be buying it again unless the tin is designed better.  I've tried pouring fast, slow, etc. and it just doesn't pour well at all."
1,"This is very oily. And Olive-y. I think I'm going to like it, because I love olive oil, but I won't know until Christmas, when my wife will give it to me, and ask me to cook something for her with it."
0,"I miss read before I ordered, got 2 very small tins of oil.  Later realized that there is a 2 LITER pack for nearly the same price.  So I'm going to say this particular version of the product is overpriced.  Especially for a tin can, I have used this packaging for olive oil before and you tend to lose that last serving or so in the lip of the tin.  Drives me crazy!  For this reason, I'm 2 starring it, and am going to make sure to check my ounces before I send in a future order."
0,I bought this olive oil because I thought it was a good deal for a large quantity of olive oil and it wasn't nearly as much as I thought it would be.
1,"I am addicted to potato chips.  I love these Ruffles in the individual bags, because I can limit myself to 1 oz. a day.  That's a good thing, right?"
0,"My dog did well with this food for about a year, but the latest bag we purchased caused recurring bouts of profusely bloody diarrhea, resulting in an expensive trip to the emergency vet. I later found that there has been a recall of this pet food for possible salmonella contamination. We've switched to another brand, and she's doing great. I think I'll avoid this one in the future."
1,"This dog food is saving my wife and I over $90 a month! Before putting our Kerry Blue Terrier on this dog food we were giving him anti-itch pills daily; the itching and licking was so bad he was itching himself raw (and no they weren't ""hotspots""). The groom recommended a diet change, we had tried a diet change years ago (recommended by the vet before trying the pills) but it did not help. The groomer recommended Duck and Potato which seemed to help a little. When we ran out of Duck and Potato, I did not want to go to the groomer to get more so I went to the locally owned pet store and picked up a bag of Chick Soup. In the time since he has been on this food we have not had a need to give him any more anti-itch pills. Also, his eyes are weeping less; by that I mean the black gooey/crusty stuff has pretty diminished greatly (we used to have to clean his eyes multiple times a day and now it's down to maybe once every few days). This dog food if the best. I will buy it from Amazon (our locally owned pet store stopped selling it) when it gets a prime status. Buy it, don't let the ""recall review"" wacko scare you. Give it a try!"
1,"I did a lot of research looking for the best value vs. quality balance, and this is what I found.  It truly does compare ingredient-wise to much pricier brands, and my Cairn Terrier loves it."
1,We have used Chicken Soup Dog food for years. It has the right ingredients and is reasonably priced. We have fed our German Short hair the senior food and our Jack Russell on the adult. Both seem to agree with the dogs.
1,"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT BUT LIKE ALWAYS THE DOG EATS IT WHEN REALLY IS HUNGRY. THEY LOVE WHAT I EAT BUT NOW I DON'T GIVE NO MORE PEOPLE'S FOOD. I KNOW THAT THIS PRODUCT IS EXCELLENT FOR THEIR HEALTH, BOUGHT FOR CATS TOO AND THEY LOVE IT. THANKS FOR HAVING VERY HEALTHY ANIMAL FOODS."
1,"We have two picky Lhasa-poo dogs that have turned up their noses at lots of dry dog food.  We thought we would try one more time, and were greatly surprised at how much the dogs loved this food.<br /><br />Packaging is like all dry dog food, delivered in a box to protect the bag. We and our dogs highly recommend this Chicken Soup for the DOg Lover's Soul Dry dog food.  (a real mouthful to say!)"
0,This food worked great for my two dogs up until about a year ago. Something changed in this food which caused both dogs severe diarrhea. Trialing them off and then on this food again caused the problems to return. We switched to a different brand.
1,"best dog food in the world, use this and  your dog will be happy more lively and look great  ,, just great"
1,"We have been feeding Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul dog food to both of our dogs for about three months now (since Julyt 2012) and they love it.  By necessity, we have to be very budget conscious, but did not like the budget-friendly dog foods out there that are all made mostly of bone meal and corn by-products.  The ingredients on the bag of this dog food speak for themselves...it's real nutrient-rich ingredients that humans would eat (duck, beef, chicken, broccoli, barley, etc).  Both of our dogs are rescue dogs - one is a 4-year-old  Aussie Blue Heeler who is extremely picky with her food and the other is a 10-year-old Pug/Welsh Corgi/Staffordshire Terrier mix who has extremely severe food and pollen allergies.  This is the ONLY dog food out of many that we have tried that meets both of their needs very well and fits our budget very nicely.  I've read about the recalls only through other Amazon reviewers and am yet to experience any negative side effects (only good ones, like empty food bowls, full bellies, and less pooping!).  We love this food and highly recommend it."
0,I have two dogs that eat this food.  Both got very sick off of it.  The company offers a coupon or a refund for the bag of food.  What about the $500 worth of vet bills I had to pay because my dogs ate this food????  I will never ever buy this brand again and would not recommend it.
0,"Let me preface this by saying I LOVE AMAZON. They are an amazing company and I will always shop online with them.<br /><br />I had been feeding my older dogs Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul (Senior) for about a year. And about two weeks before the ""voluntary"" recall came out in April of 2012, my dogs were both extremely violently ill (vomiting, diarreah and no appetite that lasted a week - until I got them help). Both had to be seen by the vet and both were perscribed antibiotics. Shortly after these bouts of illness I learned about the salmonella tainted food in the South Carolina plant. Diamond Dog Food (the manufacturer of many foods including Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul) had denied that any dogs were sickened by this food but I am 2000% positive that they were. They said they would not accept responsibility unless I could prove it. But I couldn't because I didn't save any of their poop to have it tested (my vet's assessment was not enough for them to accept responsibility.) Also be aware that they were also involved in a recall back in 2005 (I think that's the year) that killed several dogs due to their neglegence. So this isn't the first time Diamond has harmed dogs. I personally will not forgive what they did to my dogs and to me. I also know that my dogs were not the only dogs sickened. They currently have a class action lawsuit against them for sickening HUMANS, but sadly there are no attorneys willing to represent animals in this matter.<br /><br />What I find even sneakier on the part of Diamond was the timing of their recall. I actually purchased the tainted food in February 2012 and didn't begin feeding it to my dogs until April because I had a previous bag of the same food that was already open. So they knew the timing of this dog food recall was well beyond anybody being able to prove their dogs were poisoned. (They also told me that once the bag was opened, I couldn't prove it was poisoned because the bag could become poisoned/contaminated through ""other"" means...meaning they would accuse me of poisining my food and my own dogs. I had a 35 lb bag of that tainted food of which maybe only 5 lbs. was eaten.) This company is SCUM. People, if it's made by Diamond...RUN don't walk in the opposite direction!!!!<br /><br />If I could give them a ZERO rating - I would...In fact I would WARN anyone who loves their animals to avoid this manufacturer once and for all."
0,"Though I don't know if this particular one is recalled.<br />But I just thought I'd try to give a heads up.<br />So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free. no dye or by product food.<br />I found that Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free food made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named ""Taste Of The Wild"" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for ""SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION""<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these ""better than store"" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the ""better"" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying"
1,"We have usually always been a little disappointed in how the tea k-cups turn out, but not this one! Surprisingly dark and really flavorful! Very pleasant surprise and delicious with some honey mixed in! Tastes like black tea and not just hot water. Give this a try as an alternative to coffee."
1,"'Nothing bad to say about anything Keurig w-h-a-t-s-o-e-v-e-r. Hands down one of the greatest modern day conveniences and something to put a smile on my face each and every morning. This tea is a nice, strong brew, much like all of their tea varieties, and surprisingly so. I'm your average loose tea, fresh from the source type, and I still love these for their ease and speed while on the go, while not sacrificing a good cup of tea or joe."
1,"I bought this product, along with coffee and the Keurig coffee maker for my son and his wife.  The tea was for her and she loves it; a fast and easy way to make tea for one without microwaved water or a kettle on the stove.  It is a real hit and ""mom"" scored, at least this time!"
1,"This very enjoyable ""English Breakfast"" tea was included in the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0032D8IOC"">Celestial Seasonings K-Cups Tea Sampler 44 Cups (Pack of 2)</a> we bought for use in our <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA"">Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System</a>.<br /><br />It is a very rich, traditional tasting tea that works well in both small and large cup brew sizes.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH"
1,I think this is the greatest thing. I got a Keurig as a gift and found a whole new world for coffee and tea. It is so nice and convenient to have hot beverages without wasting so much coffee or tea when there is only one person to fix for. I will reorder this product again.
1,"Needed Kcups for my daugher at collge.  Thought it was a coffee/tea variety pack, but she didn't mind since she loves tea as well.  Service was quick."
1,Most people buy the Keurig drink maker for coffee.  I am not a coffee drinker.  This machine does a great job on the English Breakfast tea variant.  Wish they had more selections (Irish Breakfast tea etc.)
1,"Great tea.  My son loved it.  K cups are really handy, maybe a little expensive, but if you want easy, I guess you have to pay the price."
1,The tea flavor was just as I remembered  at home in the UK. Strong full flavor.
1,This was the perfect product for the application I needed. I need to make white chocolate or candy melts taste more like cream cheese frosting. This did the trick! I am excited to use it in other recipes.
1,I use this stuff to flavor yogurt.  It makes it a treat to eat. I like to make sure I have plenty on hand so I can have my good-to-eat and good-for-me treat whenever I want!
1,I just love this tea.  It's the only tea I drink.  It has that nice smooth flavor--not like black tea.  I would recommend this product to anyone.
1,"I love White Tea and Bentley's is the best.  All the flavors are good.  I especially like the Ginger Peach and the Mango.  I was buying this at TJ Maxx, but their supply is limited.  I've got the subscription service from Amazon and they deliver a new shipment every month.  It's convenient and easy."
1,This is GREAT TEA!  I would highly recommend this tea.  The flavor is great hot or cold.  I wish it were organic :O)
1,"Bentley's Ginger Peach White Tea, 25-Count Boxes (Pack of 4)<br /><br />What can I say?  Since we discovered this tea some two years ago, it is the only tea that we use.  Bentley is known for it's high quality and this white tea is just that.  The light hint of ginger with the pleasant blending of peach makes this a very smooth delight.  While it is not caffeine free it certainly is lower in caffeine than other green or black teas therefore also making it a fine evening dinner tea.  TO YOUR HEALTH!"
1,"I have to say this is one of my most favorite flavors of white tea so far next to blueberry white tea. Also, Bentley's is the highest quality and best tasting brand for Ceylon white tea that I've tried so far. I highly recommend this brand and flavor of tea."
1,"This risotto is excellent, creamy and delicious!  You must follow the directions for preparation for optimal success.  I prepared it with chicken broth, mushrooms, and parmesan cheese.  It was a hit!"
1,"I love all kinds of rice, and this is my new favorite one. Cooking rice is not rocket science...and this one is no different. Very easy to make, as long as you have the other required ingredients (onion, chicken broth, etc.) I used chicken stock instead of broth, and I don't know if that's what makes it so yummy, but you will NOT be disappointed with this one!"
1,"I have a new Keurig machine and I don't really like coffee, so this selection was perfect for my needs.  As promised, it is all tea, and there were only 5 duplicates (Celestial Seasonings Lemon Zinger, Bigelow's Cozy Chamomile and English Breakfast, Cafe Escapes Chai Latte, Twinings Decaffeinated Early Grey Tea) and there was only one extra of each of those.  There were 6 different Celestial Seasonings Perfect Iced Tea, and I was pleased to see 4 of the Timothy's cups.  I even liked the sampler box the cups came in.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to trying out this array, and seeing which ones I want to buy more of."
1,This was a nice selection of K-cups that our staff enjoyed.  They arrived in a timely manner and in very good condition.  We would purchase them again.  Thank you
1,I am so very impressed with the excellent quality of the Beef Wellington.  Extremely tender lean meat like filet mignon and the flaky crust is just fabulous.  The quality is that of a very fine restaurant.  Absolutely delicious!!  I will definitely stock up on these when I want a gourmet meal!!
1,These are my very favorite K cups of all I have tried...and I have tried a lot.  It is also a good value
1,"The Van Houtte French Vanilla is a substantial, creamy, somewhat nutty cup.  I much prefer it to Gloria Jeans (though I like some of their other flavored coffees.  GJ's FV is also weaker.  Timothy's is a bit stronger than GJ's, but lacks the complexity of the VH cup."
1,"We purchased a Keurig for our daughter to use at college.  She LOVES these coffee flavors which we got thru amazon.com.  Good quality, good taste and shipped quickly.  Hightly recommend."
0,I could certainly go on for more than 20 words about how much I hated this coffee.  Fortunately I didn't pay for it because it came with my machine as a sampler.  Yuck!  It doesn't taste like good coffee and it doesn't taste like French Vanilla.  Point blank I couldn't even finish the cup and had to pour it down the drain.  The aftertaste is even worse.  I don't understand how anyone could give this a positive review but I guess it's all a matter of individual preference.
1,I had some of the Green Mountain coffee and it was very acidic and way too strong so I wanted something with more flavor and I bought this one. I think it is a great coffee flavor. Those who say it has no flavor obviously are expecting something like a powdery flavored coffee. This isn't too sweet but sweet enough and has a great after taste unlike most coffee which is too acidic. If you are looking for a light roast coffee with a sweet hint of vanilla then get this for sure! can't wait to try other van houtte flavors!
1,"I really enjoy flavored coffees so when we opened the 12 pod sample pack that came with our new Keurig machine, I was excited to find a sample k cup of Van Houtte's French Vanilla.  It ended up being one of the best flavors we had an opportunity to try!<br /><br />Van Houtte's French Vanilla is not quite as good as some of the french vanilla coffees I've had fresh brewed at local coffee shops, but it isn't too far off either.  It's a very mild, but flavorful coffee with a smooth finish and no bitter aftertaste.  I don't like extra dark coffees with lots of acidity, so of that's more your cup of tea, so to speak, this blend isn't for you.<br /><br />I will definitely be picking up more of this blend and if you're in the market for a french vanilla flavored coffee k up for your Keurig brewer, this one is an excellent choice."
0,"I bought these k-cups at the store to try out in my Keurig single cup coffee maker, they are horrible.  Absolutely no french vanilla taste at all, it's not just a weak taste, there is NO TASTE!  And to make sure it wasn't just my taste buds, I made several more cups (using 1 k-cup per mug of coffee of course) for family members to see if they could guess what flavor it was, none of them knew and when I told them it was french vanilla, they were of course surprised since you can't taste anything at all.<br /><br />I will never buy Van Houtte again, what a waste of money."
1,"Excellent coffee, but on the expensive side.  I like medium blends.  If you like medium coffee, this could be the coffee for you!"
1,"I don't always like flavored coffees, but this had a good vanilla flavor, with or without milk.  I like the k-cup system, does a nice job when you want just a single cup."
1,Love this coffee!!!  Will buy over and over again.  You can't beat Amazon's price with free shipping!
0,"I do love my Keurig coffee machine, and have sampled a wide variety of coffee flavors they offer. This one is NOT one of my favorites. It's acidic, and that overpowers the vanilla and coffee flavors. You can do much better. The two best I've tried so far are Green Mountain Wild Mountain Blueberry and Gloria Jean's Mudslide (chocolatey). If vanilla is your favorite flavor, I would try the Green Mountain or Gloria Jean version, or one of the others."
0,"I love French vanilla coffee and was looking forward to this. It turned out to be a huge disappointment because all I could taste was the milk I put in the coffee.<br /><br />When you read reviews of the Keurig coffee makers, people recommend using bolder, darker roasts. The Van Houtte French Vanilla is a light roast so I obviously knew it wasn't going to be strong. But to be devoid of any flavor is not acceptable. When I made the coffee this morning, I even paused the Keurig during the brew cycle to wet the grounds better in order to produce a more flavorful cup. I also used the 8 oz setting rather than the 10 oz setting on my machine. None of this had any effect. The coffee pouring into my cup was a nice, rich color but there was no coffee or vanilla aroma emanating from it.<br /><br />In this case, I honestly don't understand the positive reviews on this product. I actually like light roasts but this is the first time I've had one that left me wondering where the coffee and the vanilla flavor was."
0,"Lurid...weak, chemical tasting all describes this K-Cup. French Vanilla is not the best flavor but Van Houttes makes it seem like the worst. If you like weak, chem-tasting coffee then you will love this!"
1,I love this French Vanilla coffee. It's not over powering but still has a great vanilla flavor. My husband and teenage kids love it also. It's a household favorite!!
0,Not as impressed with brand of coffee.  It was very weak with the flavor. I would recommend the Green Mountain French Vanilla.
1,"The French Vanilla is wonderful.  This is our first time and it is wonderful.  My wife loves flavored coffees, so, this was just a natural way to go.<br />We both enjoy a coffee in the morning and one when entertaining some evenings.<br />These k-cups are perfect for entertaining and fast perks. Enjoy!!!"
1,"Personally, I prefer the decaffeinated brands by this manufacturer but it was good for the price!"
0,"I received two of these in a sampler package I had ordered through Keurig.com I made one cup, added my Coffeemate and Splenda...and...EWW! It was so bad I poured the rest down the sink and threw away the other K-Cup. I will not be ordering this variety EVER."
1,"I love this French Vanilla.  For those of us who don't want our coffee stripping the paint off the walls this is perfect. I always add water to my coffee, just my preference as most are way too strong. The vanilla is not over powering and the blend produces a great light roasted cup of coffee.  My favorite.  If you like ""BOLD, DARK ROAST"" then this one isn't for you."
1,"The item I purchased was delivered in a timely manner and was available at a good price.  The shipping cost seemed a bit high, but the product was fresh and received in good condition."
1,THE half turkey we served for thanksgiving was fantastic very tender and moist would buy again and again
1,"I've been on a quest for the perfect homemade wings sauce and couldn't come up with it using different recipes.  Then I bought this sauce and bingo, great! Use it with the Hooters wing coating.  It gives the outside of the wings the same kind of texture you get at the real Hooters."
1,Good wing sauce had a bbq and everyone one ate the drum sticks right up. Best of all the sauce says its Medium and tastes even milder to me. More of a buttery flavor base. I get heart burn really bad and am not a big fan of super spicy sauces. So this was right up my alley and made everyone happy. Try it out good quality product.
1,I love this product! It works! I have been using it for about a month now and I have lost 10 lbs I just need 5 more pounds to reach my goal (size 5 jeans)! It does exactly what it says it's supposed to do. I received it when they said I would :)
1,"This is a great tea and the Ultra Chai is my favorite flavor!  I have a cup every morning and take it on trips--I am never without it.  The tea is incidental to my weight loss, I am sure, but just for full disclosure, I adopted a low-fat plant-based diet at the same time I started drinking this daily and I have lost 100 pounds.  I just love the flavor and love this tea!"
1,This is a great tasting tea.  I use one bag for my 16oz commuter cup each morning.  I started ordering it online when the supermarket price went up rapidly and now...the cost has doubled since the first time I ordered it in 2009. I am assessing whether it is that good.
1,I just LOVE the BONKERS SUPER SKINNY CHAI TEA. It tastes so good. I have been drinking it for about a year now. I have not seen a big weight loss but have stayed the same weight. I don't know if tit really works I just love how good it tastes
1,"I am Italian and have a son with gluten issues. I've tried all types of pasta and this is my favorite. The all-rice brands seem gloppy and bland. This, to me, had the best flavor and consistency. I even eat it - al dente, of course."
1,"My son used to only eat the Penne by Bi-Aglut, but once they stopped importing it, we were screwed.  We tried numerous brands and he didn't like any of them until we switched to Orgran.  We buy a box about every month or so.  I only wish they allowed you to put this on the subscribe program so we could get a break on the price."
0,"My cat normally loves and reacts strongly to catnip.  I've used a spray catnip before and he rolled and played.  However, when I spray this on his toys or his rug there is no reaction at alll.  I finally threw the bottle away."
1,"Big League Chew.<br /><br />True Story: I was addicted to Big League Chew. Almost destroyed my life until I checked myself into the clinic. What a reality-check. The therapist slapped me in the face for even thinking of kicking my Big League Chew habit.<br /><br />The product description reads, ""Target consumer: Boys 6-12 with an active interest in baseball"" but declines to mention the rock-star status one receives upon bringing a box of Big League chew to work. Since I brought the box to work this morning, I've since been promoted nine times, from mail-room drone to Executive Director of Awesome."
1,"So I buy this item on amazon in every flavor probably once a month for my husband cause he loves this gum and it is super hard to find and it is usually expensive. Why I go throught the trouble of buying gum online you might ask?! well, it is way cheaper - I always buy two packs at a time and get the free shipping! - and I get a great selection of all the flavors! I am sure I have reviewed all the flavors by now hehehe love it!"
1,This stuff was pretty good.  I like the flavor and it came fairly quickly.  Gum was very fresh.
0,I like the original flavored Big league chew gum and decided to buy this but this flavor is just gross.  I still have 8 packs left after giving away a few to my friends who did not enjoy it either.  Amazon did great on their part but this gum is just disgusting... stay away and don't buy this!
1,This cooks and tastes like regular wheat pasta.  It is a bit firmer so no worries about ending up with mushy pasta.  The kids didn't even notice it was Quinoa.  They eat it with just a bit of butter and pepper.  So far we have used it with marinara but I am sure it will work great with lighter sauces.
1,I have been using Olive Oil for cooking for several years and this was my first Crisco product in a long time.  The price is for 3 bottles that are a great size for the cabinet.
0,Compared to other sugar free candies this candy has little taste of the fruit or of the sweet.<br />It is not worth the value.
1,The zylitol hard candies are delicious and have a nice variety of flavors. They were recommended to me by my dentist to help promote saliva production in my dry mouth which will help prevent cavities. I would recommend this product and the amazon web site to others.
1,"Quite simply one of the best teas I've ever had. I've tried a few other varieties of chai, including Twinnings Apple-Chai, Dunkin Donuts bad rendition of chai, etc. This tea has so much depth, and so much spice in it that the bag is a little greasy. The smell that wafts from this Chai is absolutely heavenly.<br /><br />I love making Bangalore/Bombay Fogs with this tea. (That is: make a chai concentrate using the tea and one shot/two tbsp of hot water, and then adding 16 oz of hot milk. I finish my fogs with vanilla creamer, for an extra rich taste that vanilla syrup just doesn't have.)<br /><br />Have fun~!"
1,"As a lover of pickled eggs, these were satisfying. The large quantity was great for the camping trip I took, and the eggs kept well, even in high heat. My only minor complaint is that the pickled taste itself is a little mild and could use a little more kick. Perhaps some hot red peppers!"
1,"I bought the mint chocolate and banana coconut to use in shakes.  They both were very delicious.  Shipping was quick, ordered on the 23rd and received on the 26th."
1,"Use all flavors to flavor food without calories and sugar.  Tastes great, but you MUST be careful on pricing.  I only paid $2.99 per bottle and at the time of writing this, the price is now $6.95.  Consumer beware!"
1,I bought this to flavor margaritas.  I didn't need much of the flavoring to have the effect (taste) that I wanted.
1,"This flavoring smells amazing; I bought it to make homemade Bubblegum Ice Cream just like I used to get from Dipper Dan's Ice Cream Parlor when I was a child.  Ordered this but didn't get to make any icecream during the holidays.  Hope to make some soon.  It smells just like bubblegum & I am sure it tastes like bubblegum in recipes.  Thank you so much.  Sincerely, RL"
1,"Perhaps it's because I live in northern Canada (although that shouldn't be an excuse), but it took a few days for the product to be shipped.  Once, however, it was, it arrive on the last day of the projected delivery day.<br /><br />No complaints."
1,Bought it for the ice cream maker which did not make ice cream since then sitting in the fridge.
1,"I am very sensitive to MSG and all its derivatives (yeast extract, etc).  This is the only Cream of Mushroom soup I have ever found that does not have yeast extract in it or MSG.  Even other ""organic"" cream of mushroom soups contain yeast extract.  I had to give up some of my favorite recipes because I couldn't find a cream of mushroom soup that didn't cause me to have my ""MSG headaches.""  Well not any more.  I can enjoy all my favorite recipes again!  This soup is great tasting and adds wonderful flavor to my recipes.  I even love how it comes in a carton rather than a can.  The quality of the soup is great and the ingredients are all natrual.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who has MSG sensitivities or who is just looking to add more great tasting natural ingredients to their recipes."
1,"The Pacific Brand ""Cream of"" soups are a great replacement for those to have to go gluten free.  The taste is as good or better than the traditional condensed soups.  The only reason it's four stars is that most often, you must add some GF flour or other GF thickener as it can be a tish on the thin side (compared to traditional soups).  Will buy this again and again and so thankful to have found a GF version that is high quality and tastes just as good, if not BETTER!"
1,The taste and quality of this soup is far superior to the stuff in the famous red can and white can but without all the unpronouncable ingredients.  We originally bought this because it was the only cream of mushroom soup without soy.  Not only am I allergic to soy but it is so unhealthy it should be avoided by everyone if at all possible.  One thing to be aware of is that this is a 12 ounce box whereas the name brand cans are only 8 ounces so when comparing prices remember that these are 50% larger than the other guys and you'll need to adjust your receipes accordingly.
0,"If you're looking for a Campbell's cream of mushroom soup substitute, this isn't it. It doesn't have the milky-creamy consistency of Campbell's. It has a sour taste, from the cultured cream and whey. The broth is transparent. The pieces of mushroom are bigger. It's really nothing like Campbell's in taste or appearance. It's definitely much, much healthier, but I don't like the taste or texture and won't be buying it again. I'll be making my own cream of mushroom soup from now on."
1,"This soup has a strong garlic flavor that I love in recipes.  Lots of delicious mushroom bits, too.  The soup blends easily with milk without the ""fatty clumps"" typical of Campbell's and many other brands.  The container is tricky to open at first -- you have to pinch the box flat on top, then tear off a strip."
1,This soup is incredible.  It's concentrated so not as heavy and bulky as other soups that are basically just costing you more money to ship around filtered water.  The price is great.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Taste is incredible.<br />Concentrated and thus not as bulky.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />None really.
1,"This is the only soy-free brand of soup I've been able to find, and I'm thrilled to have it for casseroles and other recipes. I'm unable to give it 5 stars, however, because of the strong garlic flavor. I LOVE garlic, but it's not always a welcome addition to my recipes, like chicken casserole (this is true of their Cream of Chicken soup, too). Still, I can live with the garlic taste if it means avoiding an allergic reaction!"
1,"It's hard to find great tasting gluten free soup, but we found it!  It's great to add to lean beef, vegetable soups, makes cooking a lot easier.  This tastes better than Campbell's mushroom soup.  Cheaper on Amazon, for sure!"
1,"This is a great side; if you are considering a a brand like Campbell's or Progressive, please give this flavor and brand a try -- very unprocessed, fresh taste with real flavor!"
1,"This product allows individuals who are restricted from having gluten and msg in their food, to have traditional dishes using Cream of Mushroom soup.<br />This product is in condensed form and is perfect for cooking.  Never mind the pale color...the taste is all there and your recipes will be delicious.<br /><br />Thanks for the return of the hotdish, Pacific!<br /><br />Equally enjoyable is their Cream of Chicken....yum."
1,"High marks for PN's quality of ingredients. Except for too much salt, the Pacific Natural ingredient list reads pretty close to how I'd make a homemade batch if I had the time. (FWIW, the red & white canned brand is even higher sodium).<br /><br />As for the salt, one package of the PN packs 2220 mg of sodium - pretty much 100% of the RDA. I find it ironic that Pacific Natural would make this mistake, given that presumably most people buying an organic soup are probably more health conscious than those who do not. As others have noted, this soup is also more garlicky than one might expect a mushroom soup to be. I've found adding some onion powder (unsalted!) and fresh ground pepper offsets the garlic. I wish PN would do this - cut waaay back on the salt and add a bit of onion powder and black pepper to replace some of the garlic. And more mushrooms would be nice.<br /><br />Despite the cons, I prefer the healthier PN brand to the red & white canned stuff. I had given up on having condensed cream of mushroom on hand so was thrilled when I found this brand. It works well in recipes calling for condensed soup, serves as a good gravy base, and makes a nice traditional cup of soup as well."
1,"I feel like this soup is an 'upscale' version of your grocery canned cream of mushroom. We subscribe to this product, so it tells you we really like it!<br /><br />1. I like that the container is environmentally friendly and no concern over BPA.<br />2. It's gluten free.<br />3. It's thick and creamy, works well as a substitute for other cream of mushroom soup recipes.<br />4. Organic! This was a big thing for us as well.<br /><br />This product does have a strong flavor. It may take you a while to get used to it if you are used to the typical can of COM. The first time I used it for green bean casserole I was appalled. After getting used to the difference and not comparing it - it's a great option. This also is delicious in tuna noodle casserole. I haven't tried it as a soup alone, so I don't have a review for that."
1,Not bad.  On a low carb diet and it had more carbs than I thought it would.  18 per serving.  I will probably switch back to Campbells.
0,"I love garlic; in tomato sauce, on braised dishes and elsewhere.  I can handle garlic when I expect it.  I didn't expect it here.  At least not in this strength.  I guess I'll have to go back to the red & white cans.<br />Hey!  You may like it.  Not for me.<br />I used one and threw the rest out."
0,"I love Pacific Natural Foods organic soups, especially the creamy tomatoes and butternut squash. But this cream of mushroom soup has no flavor at all. I went with the 12-pack based on my confidence in the brand. Now I am stuck with 11 packs of bad soups."
1,"We have a boxer (skin allergies, etc.) and a boxer/beagle mix (thicker coat than the boxer) that both love Fromm Gold Large Breed food! We tried every top brand of grain-free food (Orijen, Instinct, Wellness, etc) and experienced horrible gas in both of our dogs...so bad that  we kept cans of febreeze in every main room of our home. We started going to a new groomer at a pet supply store near us and they recommended Fromm. The store said Fromm is a family owned company with NO food recalls since opening their business in 1904. We buy our food locally, not from Amazon(we are avid Amazon shoppers in other departments), but I felt compelled to write a review to potentially help other consumers find this amazing dog food. We are on our 6th bag of Fromm and both of our dogs have beautiful coats, are maintaining healthy weights and are totally gas free! There are not enough positive words to say about this food!!"
1,My two great danes eat this. It is high quality food and they seem to love the taste. We had a problem with very loose stools and this food has helped immensely. Check around for prices. Sometimes it is cheaper on line and sometimes in your local feed store.
1,Our German Shepherd was a picky eater until we switched to Fromm dry dog food. Our Golden retriever had skin issues as well but cleared up once we switched to Fromm's. They are 100% USA sourced as well.  Highly recommend.
1,I bought this due to my dog seeming to have a food allergy to corn and grains. He eats it and seems to enjoy it so time will tell if this solves his skin problems.
1,"This food was recommended by my dog's breeder and my dog, a Golden Retriever puppy, is thriving."
1,"I'm a big fan of dark chocolate.  Given the choice, I'll always buy the dark semi-sweet chocolate version of anything.<br /><br />We don't buy brownies all that often - they're kind of a once-a-month thing.  But when my local supermarket had a super-sale on the Duncan Hines brownies for 77 cents a box (!!!!), we stocked up a little.  We got the Chewy Fudge style, the Chocolate Lovers style, and what the heck, since they're only 77 cents, let's get a box of the Milk Chocolate.  We left that for last because I assumed it would be pretty tame.<br /><br />O.M.G.<br /><br />When my wife and I ate them, we both just looked at each other in surprise.  How could these be so much better than the other flavors?  I mean, it's just milk chocolate, for cryin' out loud!  Milk chocolate is like ""toy chocolate"", made for people without the fortitude for real chocolate.<br /><br />So now we've got a $2.50/box substance abuse problem, hoping and praying for another 77 cent sale."
1,"My family has been eating the milk chocolate duncan hines brownies for a couple of years now and absolutely love the them!  Duncan hines brownie & cake mixes are the best.  But, I can buy the brownie mixes at my local Wal Mart or sometimes Target for less than I purchased on Amazon."
1,"White tea generally has a delicate flavor, but this tea has a more distinct ""straw"" flavor that you might like--or not.  I notice that this particular brand is higher in caffeine than the white teas from Republic of Teas.  The latter has a more subtle flavor as well."
1,"my two Golden Retrievers loved these -- AND they kept them busy longer than other chews.  A bit expensive, so they will not get them often, but they WILL get them again."
1,"My dog (A silken windhound) loves any and all rawhide, any and all bones to be truthful. But she injured a tooth once cracking through a beef knuckle bone, and I have since stopped providing her with hard bones. My dog has no interest at all in toys, unless there is a treat in it, then she pulls out the treat in 5 minutes and ignores the toy from then on. So I sought out rawhides as something to engage her off and on during the day. Though she'll chew eagerly on any rawhide I give her, I worry about her choking or gagging on a large hunk of it stuck in her throat, or a large piece getting stuck in her gut. This piggy twist, because it has such tight skinny strands, does not have that risk. On top of that,she'll take nearly two weeks of picking at it to finally finish it off, in spite of her persistance. I am so glad that she can have the rawhide she enjoys, that it doesn't get devoured in a day, and which allows me to feel safe giving it to her. I do wish I could get the 9 inch in a 3-5 pack."
1,"This is my dogs favorite bone.  She is a Shiba Inu/Labrador mix and loves these bones.  All the dogs that come over all love this bone too!  Even though it's 9"" any sized dog can chew on it because of the individual strands."
1,These Gummies are tasty.  No complaints from the kids.  Less guilt giving them real food sweets than the synthetic alternatives with all their preservatives and artifical ingredients.
1,"These gummies are delicious. There are 6 different flavors in each bag and each flavor is distinct. Not only do they taste good, they also smell very good. The gummies are not hard like some other gummy candies that I've tried in the past. I purchased these for my family and they loved it. I would definitely recommend this as an alternative to other gummy candies."
1,"I have a similar product that I purchased at Wal-Mart for less than $5 for 19.25 oz., so this price is way too high.  The product currently comes with 20% free, so it probably is usually available in a 16 oz. size.  The product that I purchased is called Ann's House ""Good Health Energy"", but it appears to be a similar mix of soynuts, cranberries, almonds and pumpkin kernels.  A 1/4 serving provides 8 grams of fat, 6 grams of sugar, 3 grams of fiber and 7 grams of protein.  There are other mixes available including Macadamia Perfection, Cranberry Nut Antioxidant, Chocolate Nut Antioxidant, Creamy Strawberry Almond and Pistachio Perfection.  I did not see all of these at the store.  The product is very high quality and Ann's House has been in business since 1973."
1,"I stumbled on Ann's Soy Energy Blend at Costco about two months ago.  I've been buying two tubs every two weeks since.  My husband & teenage son won't touch it, but my toddler & I eat some every day.  I have to have protein to keep from shaking during the day & often I'm not even hungry enough to eat anything, so the Soy Energy Blend makes a perfect snack that gives me the boost I need without making me feel like I overate.  It's also a great movie night guilt-free snack.  I know the soy nuts can seem bland, but they've honestly grown on me.  Whereas I used to pick out the cranberries & almonds first, now I only eat about half of those, letting my toddler pick them out for herself instead.  Now, the reason I'm here.  I ran out yesterday & made a special trip to Costco today for more.  They're all sold out!  I did an online search to see if I could find them anywhere else in my area & found them here.  But $22.00?!  Seriously? I pay just under $7 for the 36oz tub at Costco!  If they don't start carrying them again I'll have to start buying the items in bulk & making my own mix.  Cause this price is simply outrageous.  UPDATE:  February 2012 - Costco has them back in stock!  $6.99 a tub.  It's the first aisle I check every trip and today I bought 4 tubs.  :)"
1,"Ann's House Soy Energy Blend is fantastic. First, a word about price: Costco carries Ann's at the moment, but you know Costco- that could change, however, at Costco, I think it's cheaper by about half over some of the sites I've seen. Secondly- this stuff is dynamite! I bought Ann's for work precisely because I didn't want something that tastes ""too good"", i.e. trail mixes or candy that are full of fat, sugars, salts, and chocolate. Ann's is not sweet, but the cranberries, pumpkin seeds and occasional almond adds ample taste-appeal to the protein-packed soy. When in a captive environment like work, nibbling Ann's Energy Mix is good for you and super satisfying for the deep hunger that usually only meats, or peanut butter can fix. And, you will not even be aware of the benefit until 5 minutes after eating a handful or two. The satisfaction overcomes hunger and there is no guilt. Men may trip about soy and phytoestrogens, but the amount you're likely to eat will not affect any man. Hey- do they have a problem making babies in Asian countries where soy is their staple? Right! Get on with it then!"
1,"I bought this at the local Costco, where, as others have mentioned, it is much cheaper there than here on Amazon.  At first, I was hesitant to purchase, as I had bought a giant canister of soy nuts once and found that they were completely bland and left me with cottonmouth and a bad aftertaste.  I had a hard time even giving them away in the office.  So after comparing the label on the Energy Mix with several other nut & trail mixes, I found this mix to be the healthiest by far.  Per 1/4 cup serving, there are 8g fat, 3g fiber, 6g sugar(!), 0g sodium(!), and 7g protein.  As you can see, there is plenty of fiber and protein, no added salt, and the only sugar comes from the dried cranberries.  This is a big difference from other nut/trail mixes which might have a good amount of salt and/or sugar added.  That is what makes this Energy Mix a great, guilt-free snack for when you're stuck at your desk at work and feel bad about quaffing down M&M-laden trail mix to stave off your hunger.  I usually go for a run or surf after work, so I toss back a couple handfuls of the energy mix before leaving the office, and find that it gives me just the right energy fix to make it through a hard workout, and all the way to dinner.<br /><br />And the taste: well like I said, I'm not a huge fan of soy nuts, but just the right amount of dried cranberries are added to balance out the dry blandness of the soy nuts.  Throw in the almonds and pumpkin seeds and you've got a good, nutty taste to round things out.  I will say that if you are looking for bold flavor or to satisfy your sweet tooth/salt craving, then you will be let down.  But if you are looking for a good tasting, satisfying snack that you can nibble on all day without feeling guilty, then this is a perfect choice."
1,This is a Great Product. I would like to ask Keith S Francis where he got his so call information that the Soy Energy was not safe under FDA guidelines. If that were true it would not be allowed to be sold in the stores. It is available in COSTCO all the time. I just purchased four 36 oz containers today at costco for $7.79 per container. I also contacted the FDA and was informed that there is no truth to your posting as to the safety. Not all COSTCO's purchase the same products. It is available everyday here in California and at $7.79 per 36oz container it is very reasonably priced. The 22.00 per container price is high but the vendors on AMAZON can ask any price they want we just don't have to buy from them.
1,"But with zero sodium in it I consider that a fair trade-off. Being one of those not-so-lucky folks who have blood sugar issues, I've been told that soy is a good way of getting one's protein, and when I saw this at the big warehouse store I decided to give it a try. I like the almonds and cranberries the best (although those do have sugar so I take it easy), and yes the soy nuts are not so flavorful and might not appeal to all. I see mention in another review about the pumpkin seeds coming from China, a valid concern, but I've been snacking on these for a few weeks and haven't seen any ill effects yet :)<br /><br />In the end, it is all about choice - and there are plenty of trail mixes and nut mixes out there packed with sodium. Your call, but as long as the big warehouse store carries this I'll keep on buying and snacking. I also took some into work and gave a sample to two healthier choice minded co-workers and they both liked it as well."
1,"I bought this Soy blend at Cosco for under $8 and would probably pay up to $10 for it...but this is ridiculous! It is a good blend, tasty and healthy. Too bad. I will not search it out, especially at this price. I would definitely buy it every other week or so, if it came back to Cosco, at a similar price."
1,Found this at costco while visiting my brother in Phoenix Az. As one of the other reviewers said this works for me being a Type 2 Diabetic it is easy on the blood sugar and zero sodium is a winner in my book and tastes good also. But the price hear is wacked as $7 bucks at costco is a great deal. I have not been able to find it in my local costco here in the Seattle area but will request it !
1,"Recently, I picked up a 30-ounce plastic jar of ""Ann's House Soy Energy Blend"" which I discovered in the snack isles of my local Costco warehouse store. It's a mixture of soy nuts, almonds, pumpkin seeds and dried cranberries. I'm a sucker for things like this. I can use them as a healthy snack. I can pack them in little sandwich bags and include them in my lunch package. I can bag them up for snacks in hiking walks. My wife likes them too. We snack now and then but we try to avoid salty and sweet snacks and stick to things that are nutritionally sound. These things fit the bill. They're a little bland tasting and you might wish that they were salted at least a little bit, but the protein and fiber content will make up for any taste deficits, at least in my book. It's a good snack. I love discovering things like this!<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
1,"I brough mine in Costco is cheap there for only like $7. compare to $20+ amazon charge, is great snack, has NO Soldium and lower fat content since is made up like 50-60% soy nuts.  Just careful at portion size, this are great snacks in my opinion."
1,"My family loves this product, however I can purchase the same brand, same 36oz size at a local store for less than $8.00. Great with a cold beer during a game. Try it, you'll enjoy it I am sure :)"
1,This soy energy blend is the best thing to put on salads or add to Chex cerel for a healthy trail mix.
1,"This is the best blend of healthy snacks I have found without the typical high sodium content. Cranberries add some sweetness that makes it a perfect midafternoon pick-me-up! Used to be carried by a warehouse retailer, but no more.  I am thrilled to have found it on Amazon!"
1,"I use to purchase this product at Costco for half the price,although I really like the product it's too expensive.."
1,could not find this at the store this year. so was very happy to find it here with amazon. ordered it and it came quickly. this is a great snack or on salads.thanks
1,This product is addictive. Sprinkle it on your oatmeal or just eat it from the container. The soy nuts are a bit dry but delicious none the less. Glad that I found it on Amazon.
1,This is a great snack anytime of the day. I tastes good and is good for you. No sodium or cholesterol and all natural. It is also a great pick me up for the late afternoon.
1,This snack is highly nutritious and great tasting.  Amazon's price is far too high.  I buy the identical product at Costco for $7.79.
1,"We enjoy Ann's House Soy Energy Blend.  We started buying it at Costco, but they stopped selling it and started selling Ann's House Edamame.  We like the Soy Energy Blend so much better.  It is good and apparently healthy for you."
1,"I found a 9oz version of Ann's House Healthy Energy Blend. I really liked it and wanted to purchase more, but wasn't sure what store I found it in. I checked Ann's House web site and found that Walmart supposedly carried it.  I did not find it at Walmart, so I decided to order some online.  I couldn't find the 9oz version online, so I ordered Ann's House Soy Energy Blend 36oz value container.  I was hoping it was the same blend, just with a different name.  Since I saved the 9oz packaging, I could compare the ingredients and it seems to be exactly the same.  Boy was I happy to have 36oz of this good snack.  All the ingredients are really fresh (soy nuts usually seems to get stale quickly).  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this snack.  Thank you Ann's House!"
1,"For a fatty like myself it's hard to keep from gobbling up a bunch of garbage... This stuff keeps me relatively satiated for several hours with a single serving...<br /><br />Costco has the same container, same brand, same product for 9 bucks."
1,I love this mix! $19.99 seemed high and I checked our Costco receipt. $7.69 for the same 36 ounce size. Enough said.
1,What can I say....its a great snack type food that curbs your appetite. Can find it cheaper elsewhere but good on here when in a pinch.
1,Wow this stuff is addictive and energizing. We can't stop eating it! My girlfriend has gained 30lbs. She is a vegetarian and this is her new favorite protein! We have a pig and today he climbed on the chair to eat them because he loves them too! Also her cousin is in the CIA and says this is what secret agents eat while they are on missions. Highly recommended for Y2k/2012 end times.
0,"Received this in a gift basket, it tastes good but.....and it is a BIG BUT.....look on the ingredients listed and the pumpkin seeds in the mix are imported from China.??  I apologize and hope I don't offend but I refuse to give my children untested food imported from China given the current manufacturing problems they have had over there with toxins and chemicals placed in food products (I.E.  baby formula)  These must be extremely cheap pumpkin seeds to warrant this which makes me nervous, why else import them from China and not use USA pumkin seeds?  Sorry, will take a closer look at all ingredients from ""Anna""s House"" in the future."
0,"I fell in LOVE with this product while visiting my Son in Honolulu, he purchases this at Cosco. As soon as I arrived back to the midwest I called EVERY Costco and requested and researched as to why this Cost's SO much on line and is unavailable in the Midwest or any Markets.<br /><br />It would apear this product is NOT safe under the USDA guidelines and this to be the reason for a HUGE cost Increase on line and the reason it is Unavailable in the stores normally found in.<br /><br />WHAT a SHAME ! ! ! I found a greater Energy prior to my daily Yoga and after my daily hygiene regimine for the day while eating this Mix. I would think this company; ""Anne's House"" would find a substitute to replace the requests for thier product. If this product is not safe under the guidelines of the FDA it should have been found before ever allowed to be placed on the shelves in the USA.<br /><br />I WISH I could find A Substiture Product as good Anne's House Soy Energy Blend that is Safe and is Reasonably priced on the shelves in the USA once again."
0,The bulk of this product is soy nuts which is pretty much inedible. I tried a few and they are tasteless and bland. I put some out for the squirrels and birds. They ate the almonds and cranberries but left the soy nuts. Even my dog won't eat them and he eats horse manure! Out of the 36oz in the package there's probably 25oz of soynuts that I can't even give away. Waste of money.
1,"This is the richest most milk-like rice beverage and the label on it does not mention canola oil, which contains up to 2% toxic erucic acid and is found in many rice beverages that are fed to children! Canola oil cannot be used by US FDA regulation in infant food. (One research paper found higher levels of erucic acid in red blood cells of autistic children compared to non-autistic children, and there are many other well established toxic effects of erucic acid in humans and animals. Look in the medical journals.)<br /><br />This product is sold in my neighborhood Ralph's (best price), VC discount, and Whole Foods in Los Angeles.<br /><br />The 365 brand (Whole Foods own brand) is also canola-free. It is much cheaper but watery in comparison. I use it for cooking.<br /><br />West Soy Rice beverage is also canola free. It has a more neutral taste and less body.<br /><br />Many people find rice milk better tasting than other milk substitutes. I find it to be much easier to digest than soy and nut products. Soy milk, however, has much more protein. Aside from being hard to digest, I don't eat too much soy because of the anti-nutritional components; so I get my protein elsewhere.<br /><br />The chocolate flavor is really great tasting, too."
1,"Add to water, stir and voila! Delicious slightly tart cherry drink for those times when you want to be refreshed, but also want a bit of flavor to your water."
1,"My wife and I have slightly different tasates in coffee, I like mine darker and she like a milder coffee.  This one however is just right for both of us.  I drink it daily without cream or sugar (which I only do when I actually enjoy the flavor of the coffee).  And we are on our second 5 pound bag!  I wish we had found this coffee sooner, it is great."
1,I like a good cup of Joe and when our friends turned us on to Kona coffee we were instant fans.  But the cost was killing us.  So when I saw that Amazon had their new grocery line I was on it checking out their price.  This is a great cup of Kona for the price.  I hate bitter coffee - this is smooth.
1,"This Kona blend has smooth flavor and good taste for the price.  I would definately consider buying this again as 100% Kona coffee is very expensive, so this makes for a nice compromise.  As long as you know that when you are purchasing this product that it is a blend, it is my belief that you won't be dissapointed."
0,I found Jeremiah's Pick Kona Blend lacking flavor. I tried every trick I know to bring out all the taste it had but still found it weak.
1,"Great coffee from a familiar maker, this kona blend really rocks and the price is unbeatable anywhere!"
1,"We really liked Jeremiah's Pick Fogbusters coffee in the five pound whole bean package, so I ordered this one for a bit of variety.  We're SO pleased!<br /><br />Yes, it's a blend (what did you expect for the price?), but the mellow smoothness of the Kona really comes through and makes for an outstanding pot of coffee.  Without the almost-bitter notes of the Fogbuster, this Kona blend is complex, rich and delicious.<br /><br />For a 12 cup drip coffeemaker, I use two and a quarter coffee scoops of the beans and grind for 15 seconds.  It's perfect, and way better than Maxwell House or Folgers.  Highly recommended!"
1,"It took a long time for me to receive this coffee, but it was worth the wait! I'm spoiled now and I find that regular coffee is lacking in flavor."
1,It was a nice product with a value price what can I say but great job and thank you
1,"Very happy with product. Roast is just like I like it, not too light, not too dark. Makes a nice cup of coffee with just enough of the Kona to make it enjoyable."
1,"The true test of a coffee's flavor for me is to drink it as espresso.  I've been roasting my own coffee for years, but mix it up sometimes by buying already roasted coffee.  This coffee has a great flavor with no bitter after taste when I drink a shot from my espresso machine.  When I drink it as regular coffee, I'll blend several of my favorite beans to get more complex flavors.  If you really want to find your favorite coffee, do a blind taste test.  It's fun and you might be surprised at which coffee you choose when your preconceived notions are taken out of the equation."
1,"It is a great coffee, my husband and I bought 18 different coffee's made cappuccino, espresso and latte. This coffee is great for everything, no after taste or bitter residue."
0,"This coffee is NOT what I expected! I have had Kona coffee before which was spectacular! I guess that is what I was looking for. But you will not find it here. This is a blend, and that is probably why. I will never buy this again!"
0,"We usually drink french roast coffee (San Francisco Bay) that we grind daily and we've been enjoying that kind of coffee for a while.  We were visiting friends and we were served coffee which tasted very good and it was a bit milder than what we drink, so I asked about the brand and was told it was Jermiah's Kona mixed with some french roast.  I ordered my bag from Amazon and the shipment was prompt and well packaged.  As for the coffee, it was terrible: stale, no aroma, beans were dry.  I figured that since I have the bag I might as well brew some and the result was undrinkable coffee.  I tried it by itself, mixed 1/2 french roast, 1/4 ...without any success.  I don't know if I got a stale bag or what, but my experience left me with a bad taste. Amazon was great and they offered a refund.  Thank you Amazon!"
1,"We were given a pound of kona as a gift and loved it so i was tasked with finding a coffee for everday use thaT tasted close. Well after looking at the cost per pound of what we were using, starbucks breakfest blend at 12.00 per lb and then buying this at around 8.00 per lb it was a no brainer. I don't know I didn't do this years ago.<br />I honestly can not tell the difference between the 100% kona and this blend and its priced at a little more than folgers?<br />I hate to put this reveiw out there for fear that the price of this and availablity will be affected.<br />SO HERE IT IS FOLKS. AS CLOSE TO 100% KONA AS YOU CAN GET AND CHEAPER THAN MOST A++++."
1,This coffee has a very nice rich flavor without being bitter or over powering.  I use it in my espresso machine and regular drip maker.  It is very good coffee although a bit pricey... but worth it to a coffee lover such as myself.
1,"Been drinkin gormet coffee many years now, bunch of different brands and roasters. It's hard to beat the Coffee Fool for quality and freshness, but I've come back to this Jerimias' pick for the quality and the savings I get here at Amazon. Its a great value and superb freshness--you'll be very pleased!"
1,"I thought this blend was an excellent alternative to the regular coffee I buy. Jeremiah's Pick Fogbuster is my preferred coffee, however if you are not of fan of bold coffee and want a solid mild coffee...The Kona Blend is an excellent choice."
0,"I like my coffee black, but found this pretty much undrinkable without milk, and my office mates agreed.  It really does just taste charred.  I'm not sure if it's all like this or I just got a bad batch.  Anyways, the price isn't bad, but I can't recommend this to anyone.  I'm still looking for a good, reasonably priced 5lb bag."
1,"This has been our new go-to coffee.  It's got a balanced taste and smells great.  Good price for the bag, too.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I wish they offered it as an Organic option."
1,"This is great coffee.  I make 8 cups every day and we use extra when we have company.  I have a bag sent to me every month.  It is the best coffee.  I have had many compliments on it. I got a rubbermaid container that has a handle and pours and it holds the whole thing.  I grind the beans every night when I set up my machine and it is very fresh.  We like strong, but not bitter coffee and we drink it black no sugar.  This is rich full bodied but never bitter or acidic tasting.  I have been using it for over a year and I will continue to use it until they no longer sell it.  My in-laws like it so much I am planning to get them a subscription for Christmas.  We used to use Gevalia, but this is far superior and less than half the price. When I first ordered it I was afraid we would not like it because it was so cheap.  It is the cheapest stuff I have ever bought.  I only bought it because a reviewer that was reviewing a different coffee I planned to get recommended this instead."
1,"Jeremiah's Pick Coffee Kona Blend, Whole Bean Coffee, I am addicted to it !!!  I buy it every time it even gets close to running out.  The folks at Jeremiah's Pick are very prompt and every order is right on time or early. Everyone has their own taste but as far as I am concerned , this is the best coffee I have ever drank !!!"
1,"The first time I ordered coffee, it was fresh and sealed tight. Second order the coffee wasn't as fresh. Good price though for bulk"
0,"These beans are so dry they crumble.  Horrible coffee.  Reminds me of the starbuck's beans you get at Walmart.  Yuck.  Avoid at all costs, they are not what they appear."
0,"A lot of reviews say this coffee is smooth, my wife and I disagree.  We think it is very bitter.  We will not order these beans again but are open to trying other Jeremiah's products..."
1,"Valerian and Chamomile are blended with spearmint leaves, lemon grass, hawthorn berries and orange blossoms to create a delicious tea to savor late at night before you drift off into dreams.<br /><br />This tea is much more effective than regular Sleepytime and I can say this because my sleep cycle has been fairly regular with much fewer nights of tossing and turning. You may also find that your mood the next day is rather mild and you feel more relaxed in general. This could be due to getting a good night's sleep for a change or it could be that the valerian has a lasting effect.<br /><br />Valerian is a very effective herb if you can't get to sleep and this tea is highly recommended for insomnia. Unlike sleeping pills, you won't feel groggy the next morning. Blend in a little lavender or orange blossom honey to enhance this deliciously mild minty tea.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
1,"This is a great cereal.  My kids, grandkids, and I have been hooked on this since it came out.  We really like it in a big bowl with white...OR chocolate milk.  Kids don't usually like to drink the milk left after the cereal is gone?  No problem. The milk is delicious, also.  There are more marshmallow pieces than Lucky Charms and they are larger in size.  We usually get the big bag and it lasts...oh, maybe a week.  Try 'em."
1,This was a bit strong from what I am used to but after drinking it a few times the flavor was great. I was pleased.
1,What can I say My cat loves them so I assume they are pretty tasty.<br /><br />I can't say for sure because I have really not tried them myself :)
1,"My first exposure to Patchi choclates was in Abu Dhabi, where Patchi stores are found aplenty. Now that we are back in the States, Amazon is the only place I've been able to find Patchi. Hooray! The chocolates are as rich and delicious as I remember. If you have never enjoyed Patchi chocolates - do yourself a favor and buy some!"
1,"This puppy formula is great. I have a Rat Terrier puppy, Maggie who had problematic diarrhea with other canned puppy foods, especially ones with rice, even when I changed the brand slowly as recommended. However with Holistic Select,the diarrhea stopped and she has been fine for the last four weeks. The ""Puppy Recipe"" looks and smells good, like a real home cooked chicken dinner. She is happy and healthy and growing like a weed."
1,"I purchased this puppy food for my friend who has an elderly, toothless poodle named Prissy. My friend was hand-feeding her, desperately trying just to get her to eat. Now with this food Prissy has an eager appetite on her own and also has gained some much needed weight. My friend considers this food to be a life-saver for her old girl."
1,My dogs seem to really like it. The ingredients are top of the line and this is a great food for dogs. I would recommend it.
0,"I had a German Shepherd puppy who had frequent diarrhea. Giardia and fecal tests at the Vet's always come up negative. I noticed that she had diarrhea whenever I fed her canned food. Since HS is a good brand and there are no recalls, I didn't think it would be the food. I recently adopted another puppy. She did not have diarrhea when I fed her HS Large breed puppy dry food. However, after I gave her some of the canned puppy food, she had bad diarrhea and started vomiting. I'm certain now that this canned food caused diarrhea in both my puppies."
0,"The advertisement for this product is very misleading and accualy lies out right about what you are getting, it says you are getting 30 8oz packets of  mix when you are accualy getting 30- .5oz oz packets and because of the high price of $17 you are easily misled. The same amount of product at Walmart is approx. $5, around 30% of what this seller sold his for. RIP OFF!!!"
1,"-helping me loose weight because im not drinking soda, im drinking water and CRYSTAL LIGHT<br />-great tasting<br />-low cal<br />-Helps me to drink more water<br />-great for a single person who lives alone thats not making huge things of lemonade for kids, husband ect.<br />-portable and handy, you can make your drink on the go, were ever you can take a bottle of water you can take your drink mix too.<br /><br />Love the product drink it with water almost every day!"
1,"This vinegar is outstanding!  Sweet and savory with mellow acidity. Great on salads and vegetables even pasta.  You will want to covet this vinegar, so buy one for your friends!"
1,"Is this really ceremony grade and organic? I don't think I should be the critic b/c I probably couldn't tell. I order items online all the time, but I wonder if this is the real deal. I drink it mostly for the health benefits and can't really tell if it's worth the money. The company website looks amateur and makes me question this product. However, it does taste good. Better when first brewed hot (not boiling) and then refrigerated or added to other cold foods/drinks."
0,"Though my cat is a huge a fan of all of the Dental Chews produced by greenies, my experience with this product was less than pleasant.<br />This product did the opposite of what it set out to do.  My cat violently vomited hairballs the same evening I fed him these.  In fact, he couldn't digest them at all and has never thrown up so much at one time.  This was unusual and still has me shocked, especially for an animal that regurgitates seldom and mildly.  Be careful, as I wish I had."
1,"First off, my cat HATES regular Greenies (the big crunchy ones) and won't even try to lick them. Any flavor. But my big fluffy Himalayan was hacking up stinky furballs in unreachable places, so when I saw these at the pet store I bought them on a whim.<br /><br />She loves them! I don't think she even chews the things, she inhales them so fast. Tuna treats are ok but chicken were more popular around here. She likes these better than the Temptations treats she had before, and I am convinced that these are somewhat healthier.<br /><br />The pouch recommends 12 treats a day, all at once, or even more for my big-boned cat. I usually do more like 5-6, because that many treats seems excessive (she would love it though). Either way, she hasn't had any hairballs since. I am not positive about the causal relationship, but I suspect these did the trick. They're great!"
1,"We have tried other greenies treats and other brands. Usually one cat likes one flavor/style and the other doesn't. Both of my adopted cats love these treats. If it were up to them they would eat these treats all day, every day!"
1,"My cat loves these. She is very small even though she is fully grown so the regular greenies just seemed uncomfortable for her to eat. I tried these and she LOVES THEM, even more than Temptation treats. I've never had problems with vomiting after these."
1,My cat likes these better than regular Greenies and has had no problem with hairballs or vomiting with this product.
1,Very pleased to finally find a real candy store. Very fast. We'll be back for more soon and thanks again.
1,This makes the best jello salad / dessert and I cannot find apricot jello in the stores in town.  Make jello as directed with 1 cup orange juice (heat to boiling).  Stir in 1 cup buttermilk and a box of apricot jello.  Store in the refrigerator.  This is divine.  The recipe easily doubles and triples.  Hope you enjoy.
1,I have been looking all over for this Jello.  My husband loves and cook and had me running all over town to find Apricot Jello.  My Grandson told me to check with you and we found it. Thank you so very much.  He now can try all the recepies he wants too.
1,This is one of the best flavors that Jell-O makes.  I too could not find it locally except at one store (Brookshires in Texas).  Then I found it here at Amazon and was thrilled to be able to order it immediately.
1,"We live just northwest of Houston. When I asked about getting this flavor of Jell-O at our local stores(even Wal-Mart!), I was told that even if they could get this flavor, it would be a long process.<br />I got on the internet and had the Jell-O delivered within a week.<br />For my needs, the availability of the product was my most important situation. The product itself was excellent and gave my salad the flavor that I was after.<br /><br />Thank you very much,<br /><br />Linda Mitchell"
1,Unable to purchase this flavor in the local stores so had to order on-line. Price was reasonable & free shipping made the litle woman happy!!
1,"I have been making an apricot mousse recipe for years and it has become ""the"" item that I am expected to bring to all family/friend gatherings. The recipe requires using apricot Jello and this item is no longer available in grocery stores. Being able to purchase  24 boxes of apricot Jello has guaranteed that my family/friends will not have to go ""without"" for a few more years!"
1,I make Aricot Zucchini jam with fresh zucchini several times a year. It is very popular with the neighbors and family members. Apricot Jello is very hard to come by in the stores so I'm glad I can find it on amazon.Great product.
1,Tasty and a bit out of the ordinary.  It's nice to be able to get it here.
1,I use this product to make an apricot bunt cake w/lemon drizzle.......my Mom concocted years ago.  My family loves it......use the apricot jello a lot and thrilled I was able to order it thru Amazon.......very hard to find!
1,Rocky Road had been one of my parent's favorite candy bars. A conversation about Rocky Road no longer in stores got me searching on-line to see if candy was still being made. I found it here and purchased a box to give on Father's Day. Turned out to be a great gift and now I'm hooked on these too (especially broken up over ice cream!) Product was fresh and delivered quickly.
1,"I received an extremely fresh product, the marshallow inside is so soft you can easily tell the freshnes of it. This chocolate bar along with kit kat are my ultimate american favorites..."
1,"Slightly upset that the candy box was open but not the candies weren't. Just the candy box. This is a gift to my father and it is his favorite candy in the world. I do hope that he loves this candy that I'm sending him, cause he has to travel for over 1 1/2 hour drive to buy Rocky Roads. See how he loves them. Well Happy Holidays."
1,"I first learned of Attiki honey when I went on a quest to discover what type of honey Fage Greek yogurt includes in their individual yogurt containers. I was on this quest because I had never tasted another honey as good as that which was with the Fage yogurt, but I wanted to be able to buy plain Fage and add my own honey. When I tried adding the usual honey, it just didn't taste the same. So, I found out that this Attiki is the kind Fage uses, and I ordered it. It is truly heavenly.  It's expensive, but if you use it just for special treats, it's well worth it."
0,"I like some of the other flavors of Extra Fruit Sensations gum, but this watermelon flavor gum just tastes flat. Flavor only lasts a couple of minutes; much less than the other flavors."
1,Only issues is that some packages seem to get old? Not as fresh as store bought; although sometimes store bought can have the same feeling.  Hit and miss.  Don't get me wrong most are good but a few pack seem to have gotten old.
1,"I like the watermelon flavor of this gum, and they're not lying when they say the flavor lasts longer. The extra fruit sensations gum is the longest lasting gum I've found. The only negative I have for this gum is one piece really isn't enough for me, I chew two at once."
1,Big improvement over old product.  Great flavor and lasts a while.  My wife goes through a pack every couple of days.
1,My cat loves this food.  Admittedly I've never given him anything else for dinner but he's finicky about treats.  He will eat as much of this stuff as I've put in front of him (he's only 6 lbs. so never fed him more than 1 can at a time).  I feel good about feeding Grain Free.  But your local cat store might be able to give you a better price than Amazon can.
0,"I love Go series and know it is good products.<br />My cat used to eat dry food, but she denied to eat can.<br />I trusted the brand and ordered 24.. so I just waste my money.<br />I'll never buy this can again.<br />I gave it to my friend's cats but they didn't like it either.<br />I wonder any cats like this cat??....<br />Honestly, couldn't trust reviews on this web...."
1,"It was WONDERFUL!boy did it go fast!<br /><br />I went to my 7-11 and gave them one of these lifesavers--so they could decide if they wanted to carry it or not.<br />they had the peppermint and 5 flavor--we really don't care for the lime green and lemon yellow flavors<br />and the ""mints"" are too peppery...<br />But Butterrum is perfect!<br />Turns out, my local liquor store had it.<br />I bought what they had left and asked them to order more.<br /><br />If i want to break my diet, it is better with butterrum--instead of burgers and tacos<br />If you have a bad taste in your mouth from medicine --butterrum<br />if you just want a ""lift"" --Butter Rum!<br /><br />It will be easier to just buy a few rolls locally when we run low<br />and thank you for having it available thru Amazon.<br /><br />We will wait if we have to--but we prefer not to :)"
1,"Moving overseas and wanted to take some of these with me.  I can only find these in Michaels Craft Stores so I was happy to find them on Amazon and at a great price.  I bought both the individual rolls and the bags with each piece wrapped, which is great for candy bowls."
1,I was looking for a night time snack for myself that would satisfy my sugar cravings but not have a ton of calories.  Well this certainly fit the bill.<br /><br />These are so good and the small bags are just the right size.  Yes I could eat a whole box of these in one sitting but that kind of defeats the purpose.  But because these are low in calorie I don't feel guilty if I eat two packs.<br /><br />I didn't even look at expiration dates since I don't care and they're not going to last the month.<br /><br />I do wish they had this in all chocolate but the cinnamon is really good also.<br /><br />I'm really glad I got in on the subscribe and save before they closed it but the price went up.  I saw K-mart has these for $5.99/box which is better but it's worth it to have them delivered.  I don't know why the price hike.<br /><br />All I can say is Yum Yum!
1,Very vast delivery of Teddy Grahams Snacks. If you haven't tried them I suggest that you try them and you will be hooked on them as I am.<br />I take a bag to work to share with coworkers. Just GREAT.
1,"These cookies are great for kids snacks and for adults. But be careful, cus a little can get out of hand! I ate half of box while snacking and watching tv one night. Plus on auto ship, they are a great bargain."
1,"Teddy Grahams are soooo delish, they are what a chocolate graham should be. The ones I received were expired, but Amazon worked with me to find a resolution. This issue would not prevent me from ordering them again; Amazon is one of the friendliest, most customer oriented and easiest online or brick and mortar retailers period."
1,"My kids LOVE these things. They are so convenient too.  I really like to order from Amazon, because it is so convenient... but watch the price on these little babies. I originally bought these in Sept 2011 for under seven dollars. 2 months later the price is over 14. Really?! I can appreciate inflation, but this kind of price increase is robbery!"
1,I get these on the subscribe and save program. My kids and I love these crackers.  They are great to have on hand and you can't beat the price. I am paying $7.62 for 2 12 count boxes right now.  I can't even get that price at the store when they are on sale.  Great deal!
1,Great way to top off a meal with controlled amount and not a lot of sugar. One can never get to old for this kind of treat.
1,They are definitely Teddy Grahms.  In much better shape than what I could buy at the store.  Not many broken crackers.
1,I got them all none broken! I wish that the boxes were alittle bit bigger other than that everything was wonderful. I hope my Marine in Okinawa loves them!!!
1,"Chocolate Teddy Grahams are so yummy!  As an adult, I love them.  I'd imagine kids would too.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- No high fructose corn syrup.<br />- Crunchy little bite-sized cookies.<br />- Nice chocolate taste that's not fake.<br />- Great to eat in the car, at your desk, or wherever.  It's a portable snack.<br />- Sweet but not sickeningly so.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- I really have no cons other than they will get stale if you don't wrap the bag up tightly.<br /><br />OVERALL OPINION:<br />I enjoy Chocolate Teddy Grahams as either dessert, or a snack with a cup of coffee.  It's a sweet pick-me up that doesn't leave me feeling too guilty.  Cures the need for chocolate, and has a nice crunch that sometimes I really want.  Oh yeah, and they're cute little bears!"
1,This is a great snack for my 2.5 year old son.  Easy to carry with us and he loves them.  Got them for a great price which makes them even better!
1,I love these packs. They are delicious and easy to throw in a diaper bag or my kids lunch in the morning. I can feel better sending them with this instead of cookies and junk.
1,"We definitely enjoy Teddy Grahams in our house and for the most part these were good. The only issue I had was that the taste of the chocolate ones were a bit off, maybe a bit stale tasting. Otherwise these are a great, easy and convenient product."
1,"My kids love these snacks and I loved the variety! When buying in bulk, it's nice when there are different flavors in the same package ... no boredom here!"
1,"I like the single-serve bags. I like the variety. And I like that they were on sale. Kudos, Teddy Grahams! You keep the Teddy Roosevelt legacy alive and tasty!"
1,"I purchased these on a whim (as with most of my Amazon buys!) thinking they would be nice for snack time in my busy household.  The kids and I both are crazy about them!  They're the perfect size for a 4 or 5 year old's snack.  They're also easy enough to open that my 4 and 5 year olds can open the package themselves.  Our favorite variety is of course chocolate.  Love having these around for trips to the zoo, on the way to the store, or to throw in the lunchbox.  Will be buying these again!"
1,"The first time I saw these wonderful little morsels was in a outfitters shop in the North Corolina Mountains. First glance, they looked like something to put in the bottom of a fish tank, not something to munch on, but I quickly changed my tune. they have a great crunchy shell and quality chocolate taste that I would compare to any major brand. Eat them one at a time or by by the handful, I'm sure you will enjoy them. Try them on Ice cream too, as Tony would say The're Grrrreat!"
1,I used these rocks to make a stone fireplace on a cake and they worked great.<br />Quick delivery and they were very fresh and shipped well.
1,I ordered these for part of the decoration on my beach themed wedding cake and they were great they really looked like rocks and the taste was amazing. I will buy this product again.
0,They were quiet a bit smaller than I thought and I also  was hoping for bigger more smoother river rock looking as the advertisment 'implied'.
1,"I've been eating these things for more than 40 years now and this is definitely one candy that has remained the same over all of those years. Plus, the blue is great for that ever-funny ""blue lip"" syndrome too! Just a great candy, and they work great in hot chocolate too for that extra special treat.  Highly recommend!"
1,"These were great for the easter activity I threw down with friends and family, everyone loved them and they were fresh and soft, Thank you"
1,"I like some flavored coffees and teas but must watch my caffiene intake. I have to infuse myself (inserting needles in 4 sites) once a week. I first was introduced to the Cafe Escapes Chai Latte at my hair stylist's. I have a Keurig and never realized this was a tea and that Keurig also carried them until I was on its website. I find they are often out of stock. I found these a bit cheaper here at Amazon and stocked up. Now when I get my hair done once/month and on the morning before I infuse, this is my little indulgence. The flavors and aroma are so calming and relaxing. I even insisted that my sister-in-law who gifted us with a Keurig coffee maker two years ago, try this. I know she likes certain teas and her coffee black. She could not believe it was tea. I sent her home with a box. The only reason I don't drink it more often is due to the empty calories/sugar. I probably should take a star off for that. I am one who does not like a really strong tea or bold coffee so this really pleases my palate. The Cafe Escapes Chai Latte is hands down my favorite."
1,I use the Keuring in my office.  The best source for K-cups is Amazon.  Awesome selection and great service.  The chai latte cups are one of the most requested and fly out of the box!  I can never buy just one box.
1,"For those who like hot tea freshly prepared, by the cup, this is an excellent product at an excellent price."
1,"A perfect way to start the day,  as a mid-afternoon pickup or to relax after a hectic day at the office.  Cafe Escapes Chai Latte K-Cups are perfect every time."
1,I love the Chai Latte for an alternative to coffee. But this flavor is either in high demand or it's being discontinued? Hard to order (usually out-of-stock) or can't find at stores. Tastes like what you get at the coffee shops!!! YUM. That's why I ordered the 96 cups. Should last awhile. I hope they keep making this K-cup flavor.
1,I am not a big coffee fan but I wanted a Keurig maker. I absolutely love Chai Latte. I make two cups of it. I found that mixing it on the middle setting and one on the smallest cup setting mixed together makes it a perfect combination! It tastes just like when I used to buy it for 3x the price. It is creamy and the right amount of flavor. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a nice kick of flavor in the morning but ins't looking for the caffeine of coffee! I also enjoy this as a little treat since I am watching my weight and this doesn't make a big dent into the amount of calories I consume a day. I did wish I could find i for less expensive on Amazon as my local store has it for a better price but it is not always in stock.
1,"Love this flavor, difficult to get as it has been out of stock for almost a year - so I stocked up - happy I have finally received these."
1,"I recently bought a Keurig coffee maker, but have always been a fan of chai tea. I am used to drinking Panera Bread's version, which is very good. However, chai tea is a spiced milk-based tea to me and most Americans. My Keurig adds water to its drinks so I was ready to be disappointed with this chai tea.<br /><br />As it brews and after taking a smell from the cup, you are hit with warm spices pretty hard. Cinnamon and ginger are ones that I made out but I knew right away it was going to be good.<br /><br />Taking a sip, it is obvious that this isn't a normal K-cup. Further analysis of the nutritional facts reveals that Cafe Escapes uses a creamer based formula and the result is a silky smooth chai tea latte. This is easily my favorite flavor for my Keurig coffee maker. I drink this one later in the day and it just makes you feel great. One of the best chai teas I have ever tried and WAY better than trying to brew it yourself and WAY cheaper than buying it from a cafe.<br /><br />If you don't know about Cafe Escapes and are maybe unsure of their quality, give this a shot, you will thank me (and them). They are known to use a milk-based formula in their K-cups and only make 4 flavors (Chai Tea, 2 different Hot chocolates, and a cafe mocha). I have personally tried all of their flavors and all are very good. However, the chai tea is the only one that I was absolutely blown away by. Two important notes about their brews is 1) their caffeine content is low at less than 10mg per cup (normal cup of coffee is around 100mg) and 2) they don't require you to add creamer or sugar as I am used to with other coffees.<br /><br />I felt that this review was best suited for the 96 count because if you have ever enjoyed chai tea and own a keurig coffee maker, you will be purchasing the 96-count of these at some point!"
1,I purchased these online because my grandmother loves them and has not been able to find a steady supply near home. She makes one cup every morning and is very happy.
1,"I was so happy to be able to find this great tasting Chai Latte.  It was out of stock on other sites for a very long time.  If you like Chai Latte, You have to try this one."
1,"This is the best non-coffee beverage I have found for the Kuerig.  Not as good as my coffee shop Chai Latte, but a great substitute for the mornings when I don't want to leave the house."
0,"I love coffee. I love chai lattes. I love my Keurig. But this combination was disgusting. The taste when first prepared was STRONG. OK, I get that and could even even like it... if the aftertaste didn't kick in. I have never tasted so much artificial sweetener in any product. This is not listed as lo-cal or diet.. so it was not at all what I was expecting. I would rather have an aspirin dissolve in my mouth. I am returning this to the store. Absolutely terrible."
0,"This company is gouging you people!!  The product itself is fabulous, the best Chai Latte ever!  But I just bought 6 16-count boxes (what this actually is) from Bed, Bath, & Beyond for $10.99 each.  Unfortunately it looks like they've stopped making this so the mark up is just going to get worse.  Shame on you."
1,what would I do without decaf pods for late night espressos and cappuccinos!!  Need the decaf.  These pods are great and very affordable.
1,"My wife and I both really enjoyed this EVOO and plan to purchase more in the future.  As the product states it does have a 'grassy' taste to it and that's part of what we loved about it.  Dont let that put you off. Its wonderful for using as a base for dipping bread, etc.  Quite good!"
1,"I have visited the olive oil symposium in florence for the past 10 years to write a blog, (i'm a foodie), for my friends<br />and fellow goumets to read and advance a product that is superior in the u.s.<br />I think some of the best unfiltered oils were represented at this event, some very pricey, but i thought i had tasted<br />them all till my trip to provence proved me wrong . the french oil sold here proved to be much better, although tasteing<br />more grasser and lavender, it is a must for cooks and foodie's to have this in your pantry.<br />This over beefsteak tomatoes and french feta provided my total unraveling about italian oil versus french.<br />You can taste ""MISTRAIL"", terrior in every taste.<br /><br />David<br />vindepays99@yahoo.com"
1,"We had the opportunity to visit this olive oil producer while we were visiting France two years ago. These people were wonderful.....they took us on a private tour of this small but awesome facility. We tasted various olive oils and they were all great !! If you want the best, buy Castelas Olive Oil."
1,This oil has a wonderful fresh green taste. You can tell the olives were picked and pressed quickly without time to sit and ferment.Great drizzled on hot pasta or just on toasted crusty bread with a little sea salt.  It has enough flavor to stand on its own!
1,"I am addicted to panforte, the traditional Tuscan Christmas fruit cake, I have even made Nick Malgieri's recipe at home with great success!<br />I have tried most of the brands on amazon, and when I can find it.<br />I find Maribisi is the top producer of panforte, their panfortes are loaded with Tuscan nuts and fruits and truly are the best quality.<br />My favorite is the margherita, however, recently I tried the date and almond cake, which was excellent.<br /><br />I wait every October for the stuff to be shipped to the States.<br />Get it while it's fresh!"
1,"I am not an expert on pan forte, have never been to Italy and have only had what I could buy in the states. That said, this was wonderful and I will buy it again."
1,"""This one caught us by surprise! We don't know of any other pod maker that has this flavor and it's really good! We love the way it smells - the way it tastes - and the fact it is just plain different. Most pod people are ignoring the flavored sector to this extent - and it's nice to have a cup of really flavored coffee - meaning - a rich...flavored cup of coffee is hard to come by and this one is very good."" - singleservecoffee.com"
1,"The flavor is wonderful and rich. I have a Senseo, so sometimes it works better to put one pod in the two pod receiver, then press the one cup water despenser. These pods seem to be a little thicker. However, a little thicker probably means more coffee."
1,"I have fallen in love with this coffee, and it does seem gentle on the stomach. I was looking for a light roast coffee, when I found this medium roast, and to my surprise it isn't overpowering at all.<br /><br />I don't understand the negative review posted because, it is NOT acidic or bitter at all, maybe they reviewed the wrong product, because this one is super smooth.<br /><br />This coffee is hard to find, I have found 3 places that carry small canisters, but Amazon is the only place I have found the 34.5 Oz.  My recommendation is to buy this without hesitation."
1,"I can barely drink most coffee (even though I love the taste) due to the acidity. Simply Smooth is the only coffee we drink in my house these days. (Starbucks is like lighter fluid to my stomach!) After searching all over, I found Simply Smooth at Target last year but lately it's been tough to find. It seems they only carry the smaller size jars in stores. It's so easy to order the 34.5 ounce size via Amazon and I don't have to worry if the store has it in stock or not. Simply Smooth tastes like good ""hotel"" coffee (remember when people use to actually percolate coffee in big urns) but doesn't have a bitter or acidic effect like most other coffee. I'd change the name though because Simply Smooth sounds like a laxative versus a coffee with smooth taste.  Simply Tasty?"
1,This coffee is ideal for sensitive stomachs.  I can drink as much as I want without having any problems.  Highly recommended.
0,"I was so disappointed in this coffee.  It seemed to leave a bitter aftertaste that lasted all day..... i tried various ways to make it taste better, and brewed it in a brand new coffee maker, but nothing changed that after taste.... The Folgers Breakfast Blend is MUCH better, and more smooth tasting."
0,Not even a hint of watermelon. Tastes like sparkling water mixed with cranberry juice cocktail. Not worth the 50 calories and 14 grams of sugar.
1,"I purchased this mustard from Amazon a few weeks ago.  I don't think I have ever eaten a better mustard than this.  It took me a long time to get used to eating Dijon Mustard.(sorta strong at first) So I gave up on it until I saw this one for sale on Amazon.  I never in my born days thought I would ever find a milder yet richer tasting Dijon mustard like this.  It is the best I have ever eaten and I suggest this to anyone.  I made a vinegrette with this mustard right after I got it and it was soooo delish that my whole family wants my mustard.  Of course, I tell them where to find it.  I will be ordering more!!  Just wish it came in a larger amount."
1,I use this product all the time as I maintain a low carb diet.<br /><br />The fruit punch and lemonade flavors are terrific.<br /><br />Seems like this is a nice alternative if you are watching calories also.
1,I love this and it is difficult to find 'spoon bread' anymore...lots of good childhood memories around eating this...easy to make and delicious!
1,"Compiled with an ample source of protein and fiber, these baby lima beans taste deliciously fresh.<br /><br />With a slightly chewy texture and a tinge of buttery flavor, these baby lima beans are easy to prepare with presoaking them overnight and then cooking them on the stove for about 45 minutes.<br /><br />Ingredients: Lima Beans.<br /><br />Serving suggestions: Adult, child, and dog-friendly, these green split peas are wonderful by themselves, or when added to pastas, sandwiches, soups, or other favorite dishes.<br /><br />Cook yourself up a bowl of Bob's Red Mill Baby Lima Beans and enable your taste buds to experience the wholesome flavor of this healthy food!<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this product free from Bob's Red Mill.

0,"I can't give this product a higher review unless I know when the packets expire. When I ordered it, I thought there would be an expiration date either on the packets or on the package. Nope. No expiration dates. For all I know, these could already be expired. I tried calling the manufacturer, and I just get a phone tree. When I click the only option that might be reasonable (sales), the response is ""I'm sorry, I couldn't hear your selection. Please enter that number again."" When you do this three times, Portion Pac Inc. hangs up."
1,"My order was turned over to USPS Priority Mail for delivery to me and, unfortunately, was apparently lost in mail-handling.  I was initially upset with the delay in receiving the product but, when the vendor was appraised of the contretemps, I was notified that a replacement shipment had be sent which I could expect to receive within two days.<br />The replacment shipment arrived promptly and I was pleased with the quality of the honey and its convenient packaging.  I cannot hold the vendor responsible for the mis-handling by the United States Postal Service and as far as the product itself, it was as good, or better, than any honey I have ever purchased anywhere, including honey purchased in the comb.  I unhesitatingly recommend YS Organic Bee Farms Clover Honey to anyone interested in an excellent organic product.  I will order it again."
1,Delicious and long lasting for an affordable price.  What else could you want? I would definitely recommend this product. I have to type more words for this review to be published and that's why I'm still typing.
1,This honey has a wonderful flavor and is a phenomenal price. I am very picky about honey - I find many have a taste that completely ruins my tea. This is wonderful. So happy with it. Stock up!
1,This honey is really good and dissolves well in hot drinks and food. And its a nice economical size. Makes a great and more nutritious substitute for sugar. Much better for you than artificial sweetners.
1,I like a little honey in my coffee. This clover honey is what I like the best. Great full taste very sweet and clear. I love it.
1,This honey has a very delicious taste and is not heavy. YUMMY is all I can say! YUMMMY! I'm glad I ordered it and will again when I'm getting low. The clover honey is a new favorite for our family.
1,"We purchased this honey to go in our vinegar/honey ""miracle"" tea... it's very smooth and absolutely yummy. haha.  I highly appreciate the fact it is organic - in fact, I was looking for organic.  YS Organic Bee Farms Pure Premium Clover Honey is definitely a great buy.  This is Organic for Less...and it's the best!"
0,"How do you expect me to buy yhis product for this price?<br />Keurig sells the same item for only $10.75, less than half the asking price here...."
1,"Guys: Although I was a bit skeptical at first, I got to say these are pretty neat because you can fill it with your own coffee and it's also a one time use cartridge for about .20 a pop if you go to coffee cap shop (one word) and select the cheapest shipping (100 capsules at $18.00 plus $2.39 shipping).  Nespresso has a very tight grip on the distribution of their capsules, but a slight design change in these allows them to work with the Nespresso machines while still not infringing on their copyright.  Note: There are alternatives to this product which are re-usable called Nex-pod, and another referred to only as ""3 Brown or 3 Black""  or coffeeduck <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005ZEGLH2"">CoffeeDuck Refillable Coffee Capsules For Nespresso - 3 Pods - Thes Espresso Cups fit all Nespresso machines from after October 2010 - Please make sure you have the correct machine before purchasing</a>..... I haven't tried these myself, they are a bit more expensive and from what I've read in other reviews and have seen on YouTube, they didn't just didn't seem to be the best choice for me; you may want to go online and look at the Amazon reviews of these products to judge yourself.  Also, it looks like the brown ones (which are out of stock) are the ones for Nespresso machines made prior to October 2010; the black ones (still available here) are for machines after 2010 (I have the old original C190 Concept machine (model c190) from 2001). Just as an aside, I've also seen videos of people simply re-using a used Nespresso pod  and re-sealing the foil piece with a new piece of aluminum foil (I tried this once and the results were really crappy and watery, and coffee grounds ended up in my machine).<br /><br />Anyway, back to Ne-Cap.....I fill it with my own espresso grind (illy or Lavazza) and I've got to say that the coffee was good and had a decent crema.  They're pretty easy to use as well, although you might need to experiment a bit with the coffee, grind and amount you put into the capsule to ensure you get a nice rich cup of coffee.  Take out a new capsule, using your pod as the ""scoop"", scoop it to the very top and then simply wipe off the excess so it is filled to the top but not overflowing the rim, then very carefully peel off the paper ring from the top of the cup (uncovering the sticky ring on the top of the cap) and then place the pre-cut aluminum cap on top of the capsule to seal in the coffee (note: you need to be somewhat careful when you're peeling off the paper from the cup to expose the sticky seal or else you'll also remove the sticky seal which is supposed to stay on the cup).  Although the sticky seal for these capsules is not the same as the Nespresso air tight seal (which I think is only done to keep their packaged coffee fresh), the seal is good enough to perform the job and prevent coffee from exploding outside the capsules.  I know their video shows them tamping down the coffee pods as they fill them, but for me, no tamping works best (and it's simpler).<br /><br />After experimenting a bit, I noticed that if you want the richer coffee and thick crema, you should stick with a darker roasted, robusta beans, finely ground (espresso or fine grind...check out <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0D8"">Lavazza Crema e Gusto Ground Coffee, Italian , 8.8-Ounce Bricks (Pack of 4)</a> which is primarily robusta and is on sale with subscribe and save).  And when tamping down on the coffee, don't pack it in too much before attaching the foil top or else you just get a little dribble of coffee coming out (and in all honesty, I've been using these capsules for some time, but every once in awhile, this still happens to me. The drink is fine, it just takes awhile longer to fill the cup).  Along with the illy brand of coffee,  Cafe Pico, Cafe Bustelo, Lavazza Crema and Pilon also do a very good job in these capsules. If you want to see how much coffee Nespresso uses in their capsules, you can also open up a new Nespresso capsule and see what the grind looks like and the amount of coffee they use so you get an idea. I'm too cheap to do that ;-)<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend making these cups too far in advance (since you don't have an airtight seal once you make the cup), but instead make them when you're ready to use them that day.  Although this may seem a bit of work if you're in a rush (and remember, you do have to buy your own coffee), it is sort of fun to experiment with the different blends (you can use any full or half decaff coffee for those last minute guests that want espresso without all the caffeine or you can experiment and add flavorings like vanilla, spices etc.)."
1,Just filled a few of the capsules yesterday with my own coffee.  It was a little messy but used the capsules this morning and they worked just fine.  A lot less expensive than buying capsules from the company.
0,"Very time consuming to peel off paper around edge of capsule, usually pulls off sticky part, so push sticky ring back down around tiny rim in a circle, then try to separate foil lids one by one, add the rubber ring and gently push up around bottom rim of capsule (which fell off on half of the capsules I tried), tamp in expensive ground coffee I purchased, makes a mess, then insert in machine and lots of water pours into tray on bottom!  Surely someone can invent some easier solution for more coffee choices for the Pixie machine.  Waste of money and time all around!"
0,there is not enough pressure on it and it gives weak espresso looks like a watery coffee.. Threw them all :(
0,"I will start with some helpful info..<br /><br />-Nespresso machine: Pixie<br />-Ne-Cap capsules 100 pcs. ($23.29)<br />-Coffee: Lavazza - Crema e Gusto 250g enough for 50 capsules ($5.75)<br />-Empty capsule weight: ~1 gram<br />-Filled capsule weight: ~6 grams<br />-One capsule preparation time: 60-70 secs<br />-Cost of filled capsule: ~$0.35<br /><br />The main reasons for purchasing the refill capsules are, being able to enjoy the coffee I like and save some money.<br /><br />I haven't encountered any troubles with the capsules EXCEPT that you dont get the best out of it, as most of the hot water is spilled into the used capsules container; although I had the capsules filled, pressed and sealed appropirately. Therefore, I had to reuse the same capsule, however, sometimes replaced it with another one. The reason of water spill/waste is that Ne-Cap capsules are shorter than Nespresso capsules. Thus I assume if they were the same size, the capsules will perform much better.<br /><br />This option is somehow economical, nevertheless, sometimes you may need to use two capsules to enjoy your Espresso, or Cappuccino cup.<br /><br />Conclusion, if you are not enjoying the taste of Nespresso flavours or you like to have your own ground coffee, and want to save some $$$, go for it..BUT dont expect the same performance and cleanness of Nespresso capsules.<br /><br />Update 2/8/2012================<br /><br />When I first used the Ne-Caps, I gave it 3 stars. After using almost 30 capsules, I got to believe that it's not worth it and that Nespresso capsules are irreplaceable. I tried all possible ways to enhance the performance of the capsules, I made more holes at the base, also I dilated the existing ones, but all my attempt were useless. The shape of Ne-Cap pods should be modified to look like nespresso ones. That way, I believe they would be better. So my advice is to stick to nespresso despite the price. Save yourself the time and headache and enjoy your easy, tasty coffee."
0,"It isn't just a quick simple thing, they don't fit the newest nespresso machines, so there is a little black rubber ring that you put on I think?!? underneath the lid (no directions, just a note saying they don't fit anymore so you have to use the little package of rings in addition to adding the foil lid)I'd return them, but it's not worth the shipping fee."
0,"Manufacturer refused to admit problem with their capsules when it doesn't work.<br /><br />Problem:<br />1. 1/3 to 1/2 capsules ends in very dilute coffee/dirty hot water<br />2. seal by far not perfect<br />3. foil cap not reliable peforated<br />4. used capsule compartment becomes overflow hot water compartment and sometimes overflow<br /><br />Since the manufacturer says the problem is not theirs, I tried many permutation to make the capsules work, including:<br />1. filling grinds to different level, full to not-so-full<br />2. compacting grind to different degree, from no compaction to hard compaction<br />3. using 1 or 2 rubber seal<br /><br />Results remain unreliable. When it works it works great. That's about 1/5 of the time. 1/3 of the time it is acceptable, the rest of the time I wasted the coffee and money on the capsule. In the end, it turns out to be more expensive than the nespresso capsules. Not worth the effort and frustration to get a cup of coffee nicer than nespresso's own only for 1/5 of the time."
1,"I ordered these direct from the manufacturer in Spain. They work great in the Nespresso Essenza C91. With this machine you have to stop the water flow, it does not stop automatically. So using these Necaps are easy, you will not get a diluted shot unless you let it run too long and this applies to Nespresso capsules as well. However your shots may come out a little short due to the Necap not holding the same amount of coffee. The Necap will also deform due to the heat from the hot water. This is normal. I like using these very much. Making them is time consuming but then so is going to the Nespresso store to buy originals or going on line. If you want to save money and have time to do this then give them a try.<br /><br />Tips:<br />Pack the coffee in tight using the bottom of an empty Necap. Don't do it so tight that it is like a rock. You also need to use espresso grind coffee. It does not have to be espresso beans, any bean will work but the coffee has to be ground on the finest setting for espresso machines.<br /><br />1. Set out several Necaps<br />2. Use a funnel to fill to top, tap side of funnel to get coffee to go down.<br />3. Use bottom of empty Necap to compact coffee. Press firmly.<br />4. Fill up to top again and compact.<br />5. Put foil on and you are done.<br /><br />You can also reload your Nespresso capsules using aluminum foil as a new cover. Cut the old foil away, rinse, clean out the used grounds, re-pack with new, place foil over and pinch tightly around rim of nespresso capsule, trim excess foil away. These can be used over about 2 times.<br /><br />Remember to run some water through the machine to heat your cup and clean out any left over grinds to get a nice tasting cup of espresso.<br /><br />My coffee makers that I have used are a T Fal drip, several different sized Bialetti Moka Express, an Aeropress, french press, my grandmas old perculator and currently the Nespresso Essenza C91. I have also made cold brewed coffee. All serve there purpose in different ways."
0,"I have the nespresso tassimo machine and I love it. I also love starbuck christmas blend and have missed it since I got my machine. I thought these little caps would do the trick. They kind of work. The resulting coffee is pretty watery- the capsule look like they are not sturdy enough to handle the pressure of the machine, they are shrunken after use- unlike the real nespresso capsules. The coffee that comes out (again I am talking starbuck christmas blend) tastes fine, but is weak in overall strength and looks really watery. PLUS after foaming up my milk and adding it to the coffee- the coffee instanly 'melts/pops' all of the foam. Nespresso must do something to their coffee to make it not do this. I find this a point none of the other reviews touch upon."
0,"I purchased the NeCap Nespresso Compatible Refill Capsules a week after purchasing a Nespresso Citiz with Aeroccino milk heater/frothier. The Nespresso Citiz works flawlessly with Nespresso Capsules. Rich coffee with a beautiful crema. However with NeCap capsules the end result is hit and miss at best. I have tried Gevalia espresso ground espresso roast coffee in the NeCap capsules with poor results. I have tried Illy Espresso grind espresso roast with the NeCap capsules also with poor results. I have tried coffee from a local coffee house, freshly roasted and espresso grind with the NeCap capsules with poor results. I also tried India Black tea from a local India grocery with good results! Go figure.<br /><br />Preparing the NeCap capsules is a tedious process at best. Here are the steps:<br />Separate capsules from one another, this can be difficult as they tend to stick together.<br />Then separate the foil seals from one another, this can be difficult as they also tend to stick together.<br />Fill the capsules, press, then remove excess coffee with out accidentally removing the paper tape that protects the adhesive seal.<br />Sometimes the protective paper tape is not sealed carefully around the adhesive and coffee gets under the paper tape and sticks to the adhesive. Which of course needs to be removed for the foil seal to stick.<br />Assuming all goes well to this point one must then peel the protective tape and carefully align the foil seal over the capsule and seal in place.<br />These steps constitute a time consuming process which is not exactly loads of fun.<br />Lastly you must fit a small black rubber ring to the back of the NeCap capsule.<br /><br />In the box that includes all the bits needed to make a capsule is a note that reads: ""Nespresso recently modified their new machines after July/August 2010 in order to prevent the use of compatible capsules. Please use the black rings to attach to the capsule for the proper use for the latest model of Nespresso Machines."" Seems it may be time for NeCap to update their products.<br /><br />So the capsules aren't made for current machines and must be modified by the customer. Additionally the NeCap capsules are slightly smaller to avoid patent violation. These factors no doubt explain why some of the NeCap capsules won't insert properly in the Nespresso machine, or just fall through the machine to the catch tray. Lastly the coffee they make is not on par in any way, shape, or form with the capsules you purchase from Nespresso. Additionally I have noticed that the coffee made with the NeCap capsules tends to have grounds in it. Grounds don't bother me but it may others.<br /><br />Just so the readers know, I have filled a total of 43 of the NeCap capsules as of this writing. That was enough for me understand and to work through the process.<br /><br />All in all I will keep the NeCap package I bought and when I have time on my hands fill some with black tea. As for coffee, I prefer to buy from the Nespresso club.<br /><br />Summary: This is not a very well executed/designed product. The end result isn't up to the Nespresso standard. OK for Black India tea."
0,"Before I bought the Essenza, I saw all of the youtube videos of reusable caps. But I didn't know Nespresso started new technology in mid to late 2010 to defeat the use of refillable capsules.  My Essenza is one of the ""new"" ones.  These don't work in the Essenzas made in mid to late 2010."
1,"It took some experimentation, but much like Keith from NYC, I got my own system down and they work just fine. And all that Illy I bought is not going to waste. I bought it when I was using my Delonghi EC155 - but it went belly up and since it was my second one of the same machine, I bought my Citiz w/ Milk because Ethical had just come out with their capsules (those work fine for me and I like the Cremosa) and I thought I'd give these Ne-caps a shot. (pun intended) So, after watching the videos and trying various ways of tamping, I pretty much gave the tamping up, too, much like Keith did. I have a small coffee spoon, I fill the capsule to over flowing give a light tamp with the back of the spoon, and scrape off the excess with the handle. I do five in the morning (or the night before) for the 3-5 espressos I'll drink throughout the day. From pulling the coffee out to sealing the capsules and putting the coffee away takes less than 2 minutes - and the espresso using my Illy is just great! Every once in awhile I'll have one that does the dribble thing, but hardly ever now that I have my system down. I use them with the little rings for the newer machines. How someone can say that they don't work in their machines is beyond me, I don't think they tried them or they didn't use the ring or they over tamped the capsules.<br /><br />As to cost, yes, each capsule is 20 cents empty, but the Nespresso capsules just jumped up a little over 5% to 60 cents a capsule plus shipping. My espresso needs would be cost prohibitive if I used Nespresso exclusively. I do plan on buying some of the lungo capsules in decaf for my few friends who don't do caffeine, but since I've never had any other than the sample capsules of Nespresso I'm not missing anything and really, it's Illy in my ne-caps...Illy (and the Lavazza when I run out of that) (I may have a problem)"
0,"I tried to use it took me,a lot of time to filled them up and they don't even work  they were  leaking  and  the quality of the material they used was very<br />Poor"
0,"Nespresso capsules have a domed bottom.  These are flat bottomed and absolutely will not work in newer Nespresso machines (after 2010 I think).  If the capsules for your Nespresso machines has a domed bottom, save your money, it will not work in your machine."
0,"I have to echo a lot of the other reviews:<br /><br />1.  The capsules are about 60% the size of the standard Nespresso capsules, so unless you like your coffee very weak, these Ne-Caps are not for you.  Even using as a single shot, the coffee tastes watered down.<br />2.  The version of of foil seals in my box are self-adhesive; much less fooling around than the peel-off rings contained in other kits.  Still this foil is much thinner than that found on standard Nespresso capsules, and may contribute to the excessive grinds that show up in the brewed product.<br />3.  I want fiber in my diet, but not fiber in my coffee; there are ALWAYS residual coffee grinds in the cup.  The brewed coffee often looks murky; there is always a ring of tiny coffee grinds.<br />4.  There are no instructions in the box, but the tiny rings SEEM to belong on the underside of the capsule, as without them the capsules tend to fall right through the slot on the Nespresso machine.  Why bother with the rings?  Why not make the the capsule tops a bit thicker in the first place?<br /><br />So until they make a bigger capsule, and solve the ""dirty coffee"" problem, this is a Two Star product."
0,"I tried these on my Pixie machine, and since the capsules are not really made for it but older machines, they don't work well for newer models. The retrofit ring the capsules come with are a cheap band aid. I tried around 20 capsules before giving up. Most of the time there was excessive water flowing into the reservoir due to said incompatibility with the newer machines like my Pixie. I cannot speak for the older models.<br />There is also an environmental issue:<br />Once used, the ne caps are done and go into the garbage -  cutting the lid and using the grind for mulch is a good idea. However reusing them seems pointless and it is harder to separate the plastic from the aluminum left over lid than with the Nespresso type which is all aluminum.<br /><br />The better and much cheaper option: REUSE THE ORIGINAL NESPRESSO CAPSULES<br />I cut open and empty the regular Nespresso capsules to use the grind for mulch, then after washing and drying refill them at least once for another round with my favorite Espresso, crema type. The lid is a simple aluminum foil cut from standard foil roll (you can make multiple lids at the same time by layering foil pieces then cutting the circular lids with a scissor all at once. Make sure the circle is not too big, it should not extend too far up the capsule cone but stay neatly wrapped around the lip. Otherwise it can be leaky). Here a good link<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />This means every so often you have to buy new capsules, but refilling them probably cuts the cost per capsule by 50% min. if used 2-3 times."
0,"easy to fill with your favourite coffe, but sometimes they don't fit perfectly to the Nespresso machine so they get ruined when you pull the lever. But a few times it fits ok and does it's work. As if it had a bit of a trick to fit into the cap slot, or at least with our coffe machine... The truth is that after a while you get tired and upset of wasting so many caps and coffee. In other words it doesn't work, they shouldn't be selling this scam!"
0,"You might think my great expectations for the Ne-Caps are the cause of the lower rating.  With a burr coffee grinder & a wide assortment of coffee beans I enjoyed grinding my own coffee and topping off the Ne-Caps.  It took a bit of time and care but I didn't mind.<br /><br />However, we have a Nespresso Clitiz and the Ne-Caps, even with the fitting rubber band required for this unit are a bit problematic.  They do not easily slide into the the Nespresso compartment.  The coffee is adequate, nothing to write home about.<br /><br />30 Ne-Caps into the process, I'm glad I tried it but won't be doing it again."
0,"I recently purchased these capsules because some of the reviews were positive.  I was excited to order them so I can use my own real Italian espresso beans.  Nespresso does not quite understand the consumer yet.  The consumer wants options not restrictions on having to order nespresso coffee only and very very limited where you can buy them.  So when I saw these capsules, it was excited.  Unfortunately, they don't work.  They are too thin that they crush when you put the lever down. Good idea but it would be great if they work.  Maybe, next time."
1,"This product is pretty easy to use, I'd say you can make 10 pods at home in about 10 minutes.  Obviously this takes a little bit of time, you'll need to grind your own bean, fill the pods, undo the adhesive and stick on the foil.  It's really quite easy, it doesn't take any real coordination, and it is even a little bit fun. I would think most people would not care to put in the effort to use this product, but if you get a kick out of getting a better price for something and like working with your hands, this is a nice alternative.  You wont get rich off your savings, and there is a considerable amount of time and effort to make use of these, but it's not nearly as hard as some reviewers say, and the success ratio of each pod is very good.  Once you get the hang of it, you can make pods pretty quickly. Try it if you think it's for you, it does work and tastes great!"
1,"Not a slave to someone else's taste anymore, now I can brew my favorite coffee with my favorite machine. Match made in heaven!"
0,Watched the video and had two people attempt to fill and use pods. Machine just crushes pods from water pressure. These are useless in these machines.
1,I bought this product and It is wonderful... It is working great with my machine. I can enjoy my organic coffee every morning... It is a money saving product.<br />V.
0,This product is not worth it. The capsules do not work in the Nespresso machines at all. And they are not easy to fill. I would not waste my money on this item.
1,"I was skeptical at first, but since I like to drink nespresso (ristretto/arpeggio) as well as coffee from moka I thought I'd try. These capsule are not perfect, but provide a good alternative.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- you can grind the coffee you like (I have used, so far, Illy beans and beans from the KC Roasterie)<br />- coffe has a density and creaminess typical of Italian baristas, you can actually taste the layers of the beans and the (small) crema blends well with the coffee<br />- you can save some money, or get better quality beans for the same price as Nespresso<br /><br />CONS:<br />- it takes a while to practice with these capsules (at least 20)<br />- coffe has still some variability (occasionally it comes out watery, but when it is well done it is way better than Nespresso)<br />- it's a bit messy (so not good for your office machine)<br />- foil does not always seal perfectly<br /><br />With time, I realized that the following steps improve a lot the quality of the espresso you get:<br />1. poor small amounts in your capsule and press heavily each time (secret for a good and rich espresso is how the water goes through the coffee)<br />2. seal tight eliminating as much air as possible<br />3. MAKE A RISTRETTO. If you drink long Nespressos, this is not for you, as the coffee will not be strong enough. The amount of coffee in the cup should be about 1/3 of a small cup with illy logo (yes, very little, that's why it is called espresso).<br /><br />I will buy these products again and try with other beans.  Personally, I often get tired of the fake crema of Nespresso and the limited availability of strong and intense ristretto varieties."
1,"These capsules work well and I am very satisfied with how they compare to the Nespresso coffee capsules.<br />Couple things to remember to avoid disappointment:<br />1. Use good quality coffee, I use Illy, Lavazza or Starbucks<br />2. Make sure you grind the coffee beans at the grocery store to espresso fine<br />3. Fill the capsule to the top with your ground coffee, do not under fill or you will get watery coffee.<br />4. Pack the coffee in the capsule by tapping the spoon down, but don't pack it down too much or you will not get good flow.<br /><br />These capsules, when used as above make a delicious crema (froth) , just as enjoyable as the Nespresso but for a total cost including capsules, shipping and coffee of under 30 cents each compared to Nespresso at 60 to 68 cents each.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
0,"the product does work and it is a much more cost effective way to supply your nespresso machine with coffee. i didnt want to spend the $60 for another batch of the nespresso packets and these work but they dont fit perfectly and you have to insert them perfectly or they fall through the loading door, if they were a little longer this problem would probably go away. i have the pixie model and love making just one cup of coffe in the evening."
1,"These empty plastic capsules and precut foil lids work just fine in the Nespresso Pixie I have. Their cost is much less than the filled ones purchased from Nespresso, but you do have to fill them - and you need to purchase high quality coffee or you won't get a high quality cup o' joe.  For a little work and a much lower price, I say, ""Go get 'em!""  They're easy to fill and easy to use. I bought 'em on Amazon."
0,"I was truly disappointed when I received this product.  It didn't work with my machine, and it was a total Waste of money."
1,The Ne-Cap capsule doesn't work very well the way the company intended.  The adhesive discs don't stick and the 5 pre-punched holes are too small.  However the plastic capsule even though it is smaller than the Nespresso capsule works great if sealed with regular aluminum foil and the 5 holes in the bottom are opened up a bit.  I've refilled the capsules 8 or 10 times and they work very well.  The original box of 100 will last a long time which makes for a very expensive coffee.
0,"this is a comment and review of the Ne-Cap Nespresso® Compatible Refillable Capsules for Machines Before and After 2010.<br /><br />This product is the most dissapointing item ever purchased from Amazon. The seller and Amazon have no responsibility in this matter but you as a customer must know this product is VERY POORLY DESIGNED AND SOLD WITH UNREAL EXPECTIONS. I am fooled once in a while but If you wish to purchase something that is very hard to handle, tops do no seal, you will loose at least half of all pods you make and it is really poor product. Dont waste you money and time on this product."
0,I do not know  how anyone can get these to make a cup of anything. They are not made for Nespresso le Cube Thats for certain. It's unfortunate the company wastes peoples time with this. They probably assume most people will not spend the time and money to return these. The cups are visibly not as long and therefore do not get holes punched at both ends like the original. Maybe some machines they work but the company would do a service to potential  customers by not wasting everyones time and letting people know they do not work on the Le Cube at least. It doesn't even deserve 1 star but Amazon requires a star to be put to review.
1,This  product has great potential because it allows the user to create their own coffee at a reasonable price. It is new and there are problems with the glue ring that are being worked on. I am sure that this will be corrected. When it is corrected my rating will be a 5*
0,"I read a few reviews about this product and several warned me, but I purchased anyway...when will I learn to listen!  I wasted my money, the bad reviews I read were very accurate!  The thin plastic capsules that you put together to make the pod are flimsy and a bit short in length to be correctly punctured by the machine, they are no comparison to the metal original mfg's capsules!  Most of the times I tried ...the capsule bent when pressed by machine creating water leakage and a very small amount of weak watery espresso that was thrown out.  I will report them to you ...as a waste of my hard earned dollars!  It's time we consumers speak out... I believe that this company knows they are a rip-off and from the reviews I read, they don't care!  I'm going to try to contact them for a refund, others got no where when they requested $ back.  This product needs to be taken off the market...Help me Howard time!"
1,This is an excellent way to drink my preferred coffe brand on the best espresso machine ever. It is important to make the capsules very thigh compressing the coffe as hard it is possible in order to obtain an excellent and no expensive espresso coffe. I will recomend it!!!
1,"Love being able to use my own espresso!!  Easy to use!!  Fill with espresso, tamp down and put on lid.  Much cheaper than nespresso caps."
0,"the original ne-caps have a domed base in aluminum, these have a flat base in plastic,and do not make proper contact to to perforate cap. total waste of money!"
0,"Looks like product fits some espresso machines but  it is not working with nespresso ""essenza"" machine, all you can get in cup just<br />light brown water"
1,"If you have a Nespresso<br />machine and want to save money, consider this product. If you<br />have problems<br />using it, write or<br />call<br />them. They are going to help<br />you!"
0,This is a waste of money & the machine is a waste of money.  I got all this as a gift.  If the makers weren't ripoff artists they would have made  it easy to put your own coffee in...like Keurig did.  This product is just a lot of marketing hype.  Not even remotely worth the money.
0,"I first read about this snack cracker in the book, Cinch, by Cynthia Sass. They arrived in a timely fashion. They tasted okay. They were sealed in a plastic container. So far so good. But, by the time I could get to the second carton, mealy worms were hatching.  So two and one half containers are useless and cannot be returned. Buyer beware."
0,"These cracker seem to be on the healthy side but their hard as a rock, will not be buying them again."
1,"These are great, but just be aware that there is a lot of fiber here so drink plenty of water to avoid that weird bloated feeling.  (Sometimes I have to remind myself)  Happy eating!"
1,"A great cracker!  Organic....whole grains....fiber.....made with good stuff.  Great with cheese and dips, but also great for making peanut butter and jelly crackers with!"
1,Organic ingredients and good for your body ingredients. Tasty. Goes with whatever you want to add as topping.  Or eat plain.  Keep on hand for variety.
1,"This is the best Hoppin John I've ever had-and I grew up on a farm in the Deep South. A previous reviewer mentioned that he didn't think the can contained enough black-eyed peas and that he also felt it had too much liquid.<br /><br />The cans I've eaten were perfect. There is a fair amount of liquid, but it is very well seasoned and, for me, that is perfect because I eat my Hoppin John with ""real"" Southern corn pones (Just very good stone ground corn meal, salt, bacon grease and water shaped into pones and baked in a cast iron skillet. No flour or sugar!) and I want that liquid to sop up with the cornbread.<br /><br />Love this."
0,I really like Sylvia's seasoning so I thought the beans would be good too.....they are but there's more liquid than beans!!! It was more like bean soup. I happen to have a can of Black-eyed peas in the cupboard that I added to the HOPPIN JOHNS. That made it much better.  The taste is great but you shouldn't have to add more beans.
1,"i like these flavors alot. i dont care for plain water, and these flavors make me drink it as i should. great invention!"
1,"Bought this for my daughter's 5th birthday. She loves cats, and I thought this would be perfect. I was right! She LOVED it! It didn't fall apart or rip. I have a feeling buying cake toppers is going to be a new tradition."
1,"These broccoli seeds sprout fine, though the sprouts seem to grow slower/smaller than the more expensive broccoli seeds I've bought through SproutPeople. I usually grow the sprouts for 72-84 hours. With 4 tablespoons of SproutPeople seeds, 3 or 3.5 days's growth will fill about 3/4 of my EasySprout container. With Sprout House seeds, the sprouts fill up only about 50% of the container. Just about all the seeds sprouted, though."
0,"Broccoli sprouts are one of my favorite sprouts to grow and eat. I tried the sprout house brand for the first time and was really disappointed with these sprouts. They turned out bitter and really spicy. They also spoiled much faster than other broccoli sprouts that I've used in the past. Overall, I was disappointed and would not waste my money again on sprouts from the sprout house!"
1,they arrived promptly and are very tasty.<br />The price was much lower than other stores and i would highly recommend these to EVERYONE.
1,Sprouts quickly in batches of 2 tablespoons or more. Don't oversoak longer than 8 hours to prevent mold.  Pungeant sulfuric smell and flavor mellows nicely with salad dressing based in strawberry jam or berry reduction.  Yummy.
1,"Excellent quality and of course excellent nutrition. All seeds sprout. I have mine sprouting in trays under a grow lite, but it isn't necessary, especially in the summer. They just need to be near a sunny window. Sprout house is a very quality vender too. Always there to answer questions and offer help. Very informative website. UPDATE: I bought some easy sprout sprouters and I get tons of great broccoli sprouts in record time!"
0,I too have a problem with these seeds taking too long to sprout.  I would like a return of my money.
1,Great taste and getting this on auto ship helps and saves money since coffee is so high. This is always a treat to brew.

0,"I planted several seeds hoping for several plants. Unfortunately, out of about 5 (using 2-3 seeds per pot) only one germinated. I am very disappointed."
1,"A pack of 12 is a huge amount of noodles. They are standard sized packages, like spaghetti noodle sized packages. The price when I bought it was better than the price at the grocery store. Eden is a high-end brand that I really trust. There is a difference between these and ones made in China. I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />Hope that helps."
1,"I have been using Frontier Herb Organic products for at least 15 years or more. I trust their quality and find that their products have a much better flavor than the comercially available non-organic herbs that I could buy in the neighborhood grocery store.<br /><br />The parsley has a good taste, is not overpowering and has the added factor of being organic.<br /><br />So if I can't grow it organically myself, I will turn to Frontier for my herbs."
1,"Can't miss with this when you really want to give something special. Product famous for quality.  Delivered on schedule.  Great, practical packaging."

0,"Yeah, so I bought this from local grocery store for $1. It tastes absolutely horrible. It does not taste like ranch. ....... At all."
0,"Yes, also bought this at the local drugstore and discovered it tastes nothing like ranch.I thought they might have put the wrong crackers into the ranch labeled container. It tastes like curry or cumin spices. I read the back and it says Made in India so I am assuming that this is what Indians translate ranch flavoring to taste like."
0,Purchased a container of these from a local drug store... they taste like cheap curry (which is *nothing* like ranch).
1,This is great tasting stuff. I make cherry malted milk shakes and put it on breakfast cereal. The Lime flavor goes good with lemonade. Comes as two-pack. Goes a long way. Ive ordered several times from amazon of course.
1,"This tea is not only delicious, it's the best value I've found for Tulsi Tea anywhere.  It's very helpful for fibromyalgia.  You can drink it at night and it won't keep you up.  Highly recommended!"
1,"This is a very high quality Tulsi product and 100% organic. Davidsons farms and harvests the Tulsi tea on their own land in India. Very well priced in comparison to other organic Tulsi found on the net. Great taste and has a very relaxing, de-stressing effect which I love. I also buy Rooibos tea from Davidsons which I mix with the Tulsi for an even better relaxing and healthy cup. Highly Recommended!"
1,"This is very good tulsi.  I drink this tea every day.  It is very relaxing.  This is my favorite way of obtaining adaptogens.  Adaptogens are found in reishi, maca,ginseng, and ashwaganda (to name some popular scourced).  Adaptogens help make your body immune to stress.  Good stuff."
0,"My Tulsi arrived, and happy to share it, I opened it up to share with friends. What a disaster! Not only did the Tulsi contain a few bugs, it is not ""pure"" Tulsi. Though it lists three types of Tulsi, it appears to contain other elements.<br /><br />The bugs also indicate that it was not stored properly. I will be getting my tea elsewhere!"
1,"I make tea from this , very fragrant and soothing, has kept the flu away. Even my kids drink without problem."
1,"This herbal tea has a mild, pleasant flavor that is easy to like (hard to describe, however).  Apparently some folks recommend this as a ""pick-me-up"" for people who don't like coffee.  I can't speak to that per se, but it suits my wife and me to a T."
1,"The bag of tea arrived quickly and was well packaged. This is the second order of this tea that I have place with Amazon. The tea tastes great, is easy to prepare and I wouldn't live without it now. Thank you again Amazon!"
1,"I sincerely hope this review doesn't confuse the potential buyer, but I found it important enough to write this.<br /><br />If you have had real Tulsi tea, in the sense, if you had a Tulsi plant in your home, and you have made and drunk plenty of tea after crushing and boiling those fresh tulsi leaves in your tea, then this product will likely not be to your liking. It is way too strong/fragrant. So much so that it barely smells like Tulsi (which has a very mild, consistent smell).<br /><br />What I'd like to stress to you at this point is that ""way too strong"" may exactly be what you love; but I didn't. I'll have to go back to the more expensive Teatulia tea bags for ""my"" preferred taste.<br /><br />I'll also add that the bag I received says USDA certified organic. Don't think it said that here on the Amazon description.<br /><br />Hope you find your Tulsi tea!!!!"
1,"We use this syrup instead of regular colored strawberry syrup. Agave has a low glycemic index, and perfect for those who try to cut back on regular sugar. The color is not striking as artificial color, but taste is great! We mix this with organic fat free milk to make our own strawberry milk instead of buying already made strawberry milk. Sometimes my son likes to pour this on some fresh strawberries to make it a great desert."
1,I love agave syrup and to get a Strawberry flavored one is over the moon!!!! I don't use sugar anymore for sweetening.The strawberry syrup is great in iced tea.
1,"I have been searching high and low for a 'good' strawberry syrup to add to my soymilk. One without high fructose or other nasty ingredients. Finally, I have found this wonderful strawberry syrup! It's organic and only has two ingredients! 1. Organic Raw Blue Agave and 2. Organic Strawberry Flavor! For such a simple product, this syrup is exactly what I needed to make my favorite strawberry soymilk. I'm so pleased! It tastes amazing. I personally don't mind there not being a 'pink' color to the milk, as long as it tastes this good. If you are looking for a natural alternative to strawberry syrup for your ice cream, waffles, milk, etc., then I strongly recommend this product! My strawberry syrup is found at last! ^-^"
1,"My husband loves the Movie Theater Buttery Popcorn, but it's hard to find in our area anymore....guess it doesn't sell well due to the calorie content!  I did find it on Amazon, but only in large quantities which isn't what we need. I found this topping on Amazon, and because of the reviews I decided to buy it for him to try.  He loves it!  It smells great, no rancid smell, and he says it's just as good as the stuff that is packaged with the popcorn; may be the same stuff altogether.  It's less expensive to buy this bottle and the regular boxed popcorn, than to purchase the larger quantities of the Movie Theater Buttery Popcorn."
1,"I sure like this product, as I've always loved the butter popcorn at the movies, but now I usually wait for movies to come to Blockbuster. I don't like popcorn salt alone, and had looked for a solution to my problem. This is the answer, and it's sure as heck cheaper than the $5 per bag at the cinema."
1,"I read all the reviews on all the butter-type toppings for popcorn, especially for hot air popper popcorn. The real thing does not sit well on air-popped popcorn. I tried sprays (one was pretty good); but, I think this one tastes the best in my humble opinion. I have a heavy hand when it comes to buttering my popcorn. Hot-air-popped popcorn is quite dry and needs some kind of liquid topping to make salt or flavored seasonings stick to it. This is about as close to theater popcorn as you can get. I use the Kernel's Ranch and other flavorings (also from Amazon) and popcorn salt. I am not a once-in-a-while-I-think-I'll-have-some-popcorn-type person...it is more like 5 to 7 times a week for more years than I like to count. I have put it on the automatic delivery schedule of Amazon so I am never without it.  It is great to use on baked potatoes and vegetables to boot. It does have a tendency to get too thick to shake onto the popcorn; but, I just run the hot water on it while the corn is popping and it is great. I think it is because I keep the air conditioning on to around 63 deg. I think it tastes better than butter and hope they never discontinue making it. God bless"
0,"I don't care how good this product is, it is not with the price. I was shocked to see how small the bottle was for almost 11.00."
1,"I was reluctant to try this product, but after reviewing the reviews from other people, I thought ""what the heck....I won't be out much if it doesn't satisfy my palette"" so I decides to give it a whirl. This product could not be any closer to the real deal at the theaters. I really love this product and can't wait to order it in the gallon size. Way to go Wabash Valley Farms. Thank you for carrying this product."
1,"OMG!  So good.  I know it says this is the same butter flavored topping as in the theatres, but it's better than anything we have here in the Sacramento area.  This stuff is so good!  It has such a great buttery flavor...worth every penny.  My suggestion...pop the natural, butterless popcorn, then add this stuff.  Yum!"
0,"Here's how my star rating scale works:  1 = water, 10 = perfect robust butter taste.<br /><br />Would you believe that butter itself, including clarified butter, has very little butter taste?  I rate real butter products a 2.<br />Most microwave popcorn is too buttery to the point of going back down the scale.  I rate their butter taste (if we could extract and bottle their butter flavor)  around a 4 for being far too intense.<br /><br />Wabash Buttery Topping, unfortunately, does taste like butter - meaning it has very little buttery taste.  This is why I have given it the same rating as actual butter.  If you like this product, I recommend making or buying clarified butter instead, to save money, since they taste the same.<br /><br />So my search continues for a good buttery topping."
0,Absolutely terrible the worst thing I have every tasted. Do not buy waste of money!<br /><br />i threw it out after first use
0,"Bad tasting. Smelled bad in bottle and tasted bad on popcorn...even after salting. If you want calories and bad taste ! Please order this product. I tried it several times thinking I did something wrong, and it is not so. Try it on your skin it may be the best beauty product ever! As for popcorn, serve it only to your husband's football buds. After a few beers ... A good way to get rid of it. That's what I'M going to do."
0,Too expensive comes out to over a dollar per ounce there are others at a better value.Now it's telling me I need to write more words.
1,"Blue Lotus Chai got it right with this powdered mix. Don't underestimate this chai -- it is SUPERB! Would even describe it as sublime. The combination of tea and spices is well crafted. What you have is a clean, soft, warm, and spicy balance of flavors. With a cup of this hot chai, it will leave you feeling mellow yet energized. Nothing but praises for this royal treat."
1,I received this as a gift and it's delicious.<br />It makes a great gift basket item.  It is funny<br />to think just a little spoonful makes an incredible<br />cup of tea.  I like to make Trader Joe's strong Irish<br />black tea and then toss some Masala Chai tea in with<br />it with Trader Joe's yummy soy creamer.  I recommend<br />this.  This is the best Chai I've ever had.  The spices<br />are authentic.
1,"When I received the Blue Lotus Chai via Amazon Prime and saw how little the can was, I was skeptical: 100 cups?? And the teeny wooden 1/4-teaspoon measuring spoon was, well, little. But I had my first cup last night and I'm a believer!! I am a chai aficionada who has been making my own chai, trying other chais on the market, and always trying new recipes. This chai captures exactly the right amount of spices to tea. I added 2 percent lactose-free milk and about a teaspoon of volcanic agave, whipped it a bit with my Aerolatte (if you don't have one yet, it's worth the cost), and...pure bliss. Before I went to bed, I bit down on a tiny ball of spice and had a Proustian madeleine moment--transported back to my childhood. Was it the cardamom, the ginger...? This is truly a great blend. Takes up little space and not too much from my tea budget. Oregon scores again by making a supreme product! Thank you so much!!"
1,"I got hooked on this chai when I decided to give up coffee.  It still has a little bit of caffeine, but much less than coffee does.  It's nice and spicy (you really get the flavor of black pepper) and actually easy to prepare.  Initially, I thought it was too complicated to boil water and then add milk separately, but it allows you to adjust to your own tastes.  I usually add a little more milk than instructed to cut down on the spice and add a little more creaminess.  The thing I really like about this chai mix is that it's not sweet at all.  If you want sweet, you add your own sweetener - I usually use a spoonful of white sugar or honey.  After drinking this stuff, I tried some pre-sweetended mix, and there was no comparison.  This stuff tastes ""real"" and without chemicals or preservatives."
1,"This is hands down THE best chai - IF you like your chai spicy (and what's the point if it's not spicy?).  Bonus, it's instant!  Don't be deterred by the price of this small can - you use just 1/8 (yes, that's right...one-eighth) of a teaspoon per cup, add hot water, milk & sweetner and instantly you have a cup of hot, spicy chai goodness.  I LOVE that there is no milk or artificial milk or sweetner of any kind, so I can customize my own cup and don't have to deal with any unwanted goodies.<br /><br />The company seems really conscientious and only uses ORGANIC herbs/spices.  If you go to their website they list each spice detailing the health benefits.  When I gave up coffee I became a chai fanatic and darn near went broke drinking a local brand that comes liquid in bottles (at $10/qt!).  Plus it was sweetened, so I couldn't control the sweetness - pre-sweetened is ALWAYS too sweet for me.  I went online and ordered every unsweetened chai I could find and started brewing my own.  I kept thinking ""why doesn't someone take the liquid and dehydrate it""?  This was the only company that did and it just happened that it was the best tasting!  You can buy this in one-pound bags as well, so as soon as I'm finished with my can (which I've had for over a month now), I'll start buying in bulk to fill my cans.  The cans are the perfect size too - they fit easily in your purse for chai-on-the-go."
1,"This chai mix is wonderful! I have been searching for such a long time for something like this. I am diabetic, and try not to use too much artificial sweetener. This is perfect as it is simply the tea and spices ground very finely. I am able to add stevia and a splash of soy creamer...delicious! This mix is peppery, which is just how I like my chai. Although I didn't get 100 cups out of it (closer to 50 or 60), it is definitely worth the price!"
1,"This masala chai is absolutely delicious!  It is definitely more spicy than the average American vanilla chai, and it is definitely more traditional than modern vanilla chai.<br /><br />Because of the yummy spices, you'll be able to feel your tummy being warmed up!  Num!<br /><br />This is a delicious product that is inexpensive because it makes so many cups of chai in a small package.  You only need a very small amount per cup, added to warm milk.  No complaints here!"
1,"I love anything to do with tea. But when I'm on the run, or don't want to deal with tea leaves (all my teas are loose, because honestly, it's just better that way), something instant is always a good idea. Since Chai Tea began my love for tea, I began searching for the perfect instant chai. When I found this, I was extremely skeptical. How can this tiny little thing make 100 cups of tea? And the price? Why should I pay that much money for something that might not taste good?<br /><br />Luckily for me, I had just gotten paid the day before. So I bought this on a whim and crossed my fingers.<br /><br />When this arrived, I was so excited that I couldn't help but make a cup right then and there. The tin is very, very small, which deterred me somewhat, but I pressed on. A tiny wooden spoon rests inside the chai (and if you can't find it, try digging it up a little with a toothpick). I took a spoonful of the mix and put it into a 12 oz cup, and added another scoop for good measure. I added a little hot water and some milk and took my first sip. The spices hit me like a train. After swallowing, it leaves a trickle of spice in the back of your throat--something very few chais have managed to do. This chai is very spicy, but not cinnamon spicy like some other chais. The taste is truly organic.<br /><br />If you don't like chai that's loaded with spice, then this tea isn't the one for you. But if you don't like spicy teas, you shouldn't be seeking out traditional chais. This tea most likely won't last me through 100 cups (as I like my tea strong), so I guess 50 will have to do. For $0.34 a cup ($0.16 if you only use one scoopful), you can't really go wrong. I would highly suggest trying this one out."
1,"I have tried several of the instant chai tea's and this one is the best. I like having the ability to make it as spicy as I want. It has a nice peppery taste. And I REALLY like that it's unsweetend, which is hard to find. The bonus is that the spices are organic! This needs no added sugar or sweetener in my opinion. It's just that good! And 3 ounces of tea doesn't sound like much, but it comes with a cute little wooden scoop to measure with (I use 2 heaping scoopfuls for 16oz) and I've been dipping into it daily for 6 weeks. Just about ready to order a new tin. I like the tin too, as it's cute and I will reuse it in some way. It's delicious iced as well, just adding to a bit of hot water, then add your ice and milk. Enjoy!"
1,This stuff is great!  Full chocolate taste blended with a coffee kick.  Nice pick me up in the afternoon before a boring meeting.  I had to hide it in my desk because my co-workers kept stealing them.
1,I love passion fruit juice and this is a very good product. Each bottle makes about a gallon. It is low in sugar and low on glycemic index. Has a lot of potassium and is a natural relaxer. Makes great cocktails too if it isn't relaxing enough for you straight up! Fast delivery and great product!
1,"My father is all about blod coffee, especially with the keuring. He drinks about 4 cups a day and before the keuring use to have an espresso maker and make a cup at night. I don't think I've seen a day where he DOESN'T drink coffee lol<br /><br />So when I heard about the Starbucks K-Cups coming out back in late October early November, I knew this was something I wanted to try. But instead of buying a box for myself, when I saw the flavors I knew I rather buy one for my father instead. Well I was skeptical about it after I brought it home, but low and behold he drank every single cup in a week! Beside this brand and the ""Rev"" bold coffee, I think this is a winner! My father HATES flavored coffee and so it was all about the good taste of something bold.<br /><br />So if you know someone who drinks only blod coffee and maybe also loves Starbucks, but also has a Keuring, get them this coffee! This could actually be cheaper than going to Starbucks. Also Bed, Bath & Beyond sells the cups. If you've got a 20% off coupon, especially around the holidays and can't afford it on Amazon, try there to maybe test run this flavor."
1,"Starbucks Sumatra has always been my favorite, so I was excited when the K-cup finally came out. Overall, they did a very good job. But one big caveat: If you get a Tall or Grande at Starbucks, one K-cup is not going to a good substitute. The largest setting on a Keurig platinum is 12oz, which is a Tall in Starbucks lingo. I've enjoyed this at 8oz, but too much of a sacrifice at larger settings. What this means is I typically need 2 K-cups for my morning fix. This can be an issue for any of the bold coffees, but since I've been a Starbucks Sumatra drinker for years, I notice it more---in taste and in my wallet. I'll continue to buy this, but I'm also drinking Green Mountain Sumatran Reserve. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M9ZLEG"">Green Mountain Fair Trade Organic Sumatran Reserve Extra Bold (24 K-cups) Keurig</a>It's cheaper and I can use the 10 oz setting."
1,"If you like dark coffee, you will love Starbucks Sumatra. It's by far my favorite coffee, and keurig makes it very convenient."
1,"I've tried two of the starbucks k-cups, one a medium roast miss, and this, a wonderful dark and bold cup of coffee that manages to be dark without being bitter or burnt. The dark Sumatra is a winner for people who like their coffee tall dark and delicious."
1,"You know what's sad? At the time of purchasing this, I was a Starbucks employee, and this was less expensive than the same product on the actual starbucks site.... with my partner discount included!<br /><br />I am true to my half-Jewish roots (aka I am SUPER cheap), and this made me happy. I saved a few bucks and I still got my coffee ;)"

1,"In 2011, when StarBucks broke away from Tassimo Bosch over a contractual dispute, I was completely disappointed, and wondered<br />what other Options were going to be available, in the meantime, I purchased a warehouse supply of StarBuck's Coffee & Cappuccino and<br />started researching a New Coffee Machine, and then ... in November, I found out that Starbucks was offering the ""K-Cup"" Version, for the Keurig Coffee machines. I ordered and received a Brand New B145 OfficePRO model, a supposedly 'Heavy-Duty' Keurig Model ...<br /><br />In January, I started to put the Keurig thru it's paces, along side the Tassimo, and frankly the Tassimo is still SUPERIOR, in the way that it Brews for Better Flavor, has a Faster Brewing Cycle, and heats the H2O to the Optimal Temperature, than the Keurig, which BTW, is/was a lot NOSIER than the Tassimo. In all fairness, this could be  a 'technical' problem with the Bar Code settings on the K-Cups. Note , that I continued to also use my Red Tassimo unit, as it is/was the only coffee unit to use the Milk Creamers, as Keurig still does not offer that option, anywhere!<br /><br />In February, I left on a 3-week trip, and as I always do, I turned off all the unnecessary electric Household appliances, and took off.<br />When I returned back this month of March, I was so PISSED to find out that the Brand New Keurig was totally INOPERABLE!<br />Nada! Zip! Zero! Despite, doing everything that was Recommended on Forums (don't go the Keurig Forums, as they are so Worthless!)<br />Right now, I have a large, fancy Keurig BRICK that I am attempting to get a Refund for, so stay tuned!<br /><br />* Sumatra Dark - Pike Place + Colombian + French Roast + Folgers are the different varieties that I tried on the New Keurig machine.<br />  The Colombian & Sumatra Dark Roast are the Best of the lot and the French Roast is also recommended to try out.<br /><br />Read my comments, after each bullet item:<br /><br />  * Features fresh Starbucks coffee in an easy-to-brew single-cup (K-Cup) serving. - Not as good as the Tassimo, which is about<br />  2 Steps BELOW a StarBucks Coffee House. I often found the Keurig ""Brew"" to be a tad Watery, not Rich & Flavorful.<br /> * Brews in 1 minute or less, so you can grab a cup when you're in a rush. - BUT, you have to Turn the Unit ON FIRST,<br />  so that it will Warm Up first, before the Blue Light comes on, indicating that it is ready to start brewing.<br /> * Medium Roast Ground Coffee - They call it 'Medium', but I think it's more MILD!<br /> * Smooth & Balanced - Disagree, Balanced with What? Tea?<br /> * Rumor of a Sale Price of only 38 buckaroos at Sam's Club & Costco - I cannot confirm this rumor.<br /><br />* There is now a New Rumor that StarBucks is going to be offering their Consumer Coffee Machine in the fall!<br /><br />Stay Tuned!"
1,"Excellent experience and fast shipping!  I will surely continue to shop with them again!  If you love fresh coffee and can't get it being stationed overseas, this is your stop!"
0,Took a chance on these. AWFUL! I know Starbucks is known for burnt tasting coffee but this is ridiculous. I actually like their in-store brewed coffees. Never tasted coffee THIS burnt before. Try Green Mountain Barista Prima (French Roast is da bomb!). A gazillion times better this stuff.
1,"Many people, including myself grew up on this soup. It was one of the few vegetables I looked forward to as a kid. This is my favorite vegetable soup, and I pretty much judge all others against it. Unfortunately, it has become increasingly difficult to find this product in my area. In fact, I can't find it at all. It was refreshing to stumble across it here on Amazon. I had not previously purchased more than one bag at a time when I wanted it. But after ordering it in bulk, I found a few other uses for it.<br /><br />Normal Use- This soup is great just by itself. Add water and you are good to go. But it is best if you add your own touch to it. I suppose each family has their own way of using it. I like to add stew meat (as per the instructions), and also a little extra carrot, celery, potatoes that I have on hand. You could pretty much add any vegetable, or even some canned tomato product to make it just how you like it. It's an awesome launch pad for perfect vegetable beef soup.<br /><br />Camping- It is a great camping food to take along. Take along some frozen stew meat, a carrot, a potato, etc. Brown the meat in a dutch oven over some coals, throw in the sliced vegetables and let it simmer for an hour. Your friends will be amazed wondering how you made such a great soup without a bunch of vegetables, and spices. It's super easy and fills you up with some tasty warm nutritious food on chilly nights.<br /><br />Prepping/Food Storage- This is a shelf stable food that lasts a very long time just sitting in the pantry. It is also easy to use by just adding water. Perfect for emergencies, or times when you may be unable to get to the store. If you can simmer water, you can have a satisfying meal for the whole family with this stuff.<br /><br />Potlucks- I hate those times when at the last minute I remember I have a potluck to do at work the following day. No problem. Get the large crockpot out of the cupboard. Cook it however you like it that night, then store in the fridge. Throw it in the crock pot the next day an hour or so before the time. Just add some paper bowls, bag of oyster shaped crackers, and plastic spoons and you'll be bringing home an empty crockpot.<br /><br />This really is a very versatile great tasting soup. Perfect item to have on hand!!!"
1,"Have used the Mrs Grass soup mix for several years, preferring it over other dry mix soup bases because it does not contain rice, which most others seem to include.  We slow cook the soup, adding stew meat and other fresh vegetables to enhance the flavor and nutrional value.  It is very easy to customize the ingredients to suite your own personal preferences.  Left overs are easily refridgerated and can be used by simply reheating."
1,"I have used both the Beef and chicken soup mixes from Mrs Grass for years to make a nutritious home made soup. When Walmart stopped carrying it for sale I looked on the 'net to see where I could get it. Amazon has been great to deal with on getting it in bulk packages of 8.<br /><br />My way of making it involves adding 12 cups water, fresh garlic, onions, sliced carrots, celery and beef from either leftover roast/steak or inexpensive beef steak browned (leftover chicken in the chicken soup mix). I also add one can of diced tomatoes with a couple of beef bouillon cubes. In order to have the best taste it needs to simmer on the stove for at least 3 hours.<br /><br />This will make enough to feed a lot of people or by freezing the remains, Dinner for 1 for many nights (3 for me, I am a big eater). Very economical"
1,"We love this soup, but it is hard to find in stores. When I saw this item on Amazon for the good price, plus free shipping , just had to get it. We eat a lot of it in the cold months. We cook groundbeef, then add everything in the pouch, and it is wonderful and tasty."
1,Can't find this great soup mix anywhere in the Nashville area at any store. So glad Amazon has it and I will buy it again! Highly recommended! A wonderful mix you just add meat to if that is your desire.
1,"The flavor of the soup starter is great and tha seasonings and bits of vegetables are a wonderful addition to the dish. My family including 3 teenage grandsons love "" my soup""."
1,"This soup mix has been sold in stores for many years. When I recently went to the store to buy more, I found it was no longer available. In checking online, I found the soup mix on Amazon. The mix is great - add stew meat, any vegetables, mushrooms, diced tomatoes - whatever you want to add. For two people you get 6 1/2 good tasting meals out of one package. We freeze the leftovers in individual containers. Very economical and good tasting!"
1,"We have been using this product for years.Not only can you make soups with it ,but you can use it as stew starter,dip seasoning or just use as a shake on seasoning. Mrs. Grass also has a fine assortment of other great mixes."
1,"My local grocers stopped carrying all soup mixes with dehydrated veggies. I like dehydrated veggies. I prefer the Bear Creek soup mix but noticed that Mrs. Grass, which I like also, was much cheaper. It arrived promptly in a really big box. I have eaten all of them. I will probably order again."
1,This is a great tasting product. Cannot find it in major supermarkets anymore. Happy to find it online. Highly recommend it.
1,"Loved this product,but sorry to say it can only be bought on line. I use it as a base and add some veggies and beef. It makes a harty meal."
1,"I love these soup mixes. They're not as good as homemade, of course, but they're still very good. I usually add a variety of things to mine like additional veggies, etc.<br /><br />I highly recommend these for a quick and hearty supper solution!"
1,"For anyone who loves home made vegetable beef soup this is a must for flavoring.  YOU add the potatoes, celery, peas, corn, onions, and all the  wholesome vegetables you prefer along with  very lean stewing beef. Add some tomato sauce to the water and then add the amazing flavor of Mrs. Grass's homestyle beef vegetable soup mix and you had have a gourmet soup that was easy to prepare and wonderful to eat.  The aroma will fill your home with memories of times past.  You will experience a great feeling of  home and family as it simmers in the pan. This is not an ""exotic"" mix, but rather a down home flavor that your whole family will enjoy."
1,"Easy to make and a filling soup. It is hard to find in any stores in my area so am very happy Amazon has the mix for sale. I can eat the soup even though I am on Weight Watchers! If you want, you can add extra noodles and carrots when extra company arrives! Short time to cook. Love the soup!"
1,I was so thrilled to find this soup at a decent price. I look in every grocery and department store I go in but haven't been able to find it for a couple of years. I'm not sure why it is so hard to find because according to the reviews it is a much-loved product. Initially Amazon said it would take 8-10 weeks to ship but as soon as the order was placed they bumped that up & I received it in about a week. We are so happy to have our soup in the house for the winter!
1,I love this soup; it's perfect with warm bread and a salad for a cozy meal on blustery days.  I usually brown beef and add tomatoes and leftover vegetables to the mix and just let it simmer in my crock pot....easy and delicious.
1,"I can't find this in stores around Los Angeles, so I seeked the help of Amazon. Huge success... Totally awesome."
1,wish this product wasn't so hard to find.  makes the best soups ever.  always taste homemade....
1,"This is one of our favorite soup mix, but unfortunately it's becoming very hard to find in the grocery stores. Great price, fast dilivery."
1,Love this stuff.  Been using it for many years.  Only soup mix that tastes good in my book.
1,easy to make and has a great taste.  I have used this for over 2 years.
1,The product is great!!!!!!!My kids are all grown and have families of their own. I shared it with them and they all loved it too.Purchased it directly from Amazon because it's hard to find in the store.
1,"I'm not ashamed to admit that I love soup mixes.  I know that making home made soup is easy, and even fun if you have the time.  But nothing beats a mix that can be dumped into a pot with some browned beef, or any other optional ingredient you favor, and have it be ready and delicious in 20 minutes or less.  Mrs. Grass is a very good mix compared to a lot of the ones more easily available in the stores.  It taste a little more like home made to me.  And believe me I haves tried all of them available in the stores.  The only reason I refer to it as second best if because I also buy the Bear Creek veggie beef soup mix also available on Amazon, (link enclosed).  I have to give the nod here to Bear Creek for just being a little spicier, and in my opinion having just a tad better beef broth.  I still highly recommend Mrs. Grass for it is much better than the store bought mixes, and besides, you may like your soup a little on the lighter side.  Still very tasty, and very worth it...

YUMMY!!! please never discontinue!!!!"
1,"Thoughts of great soup on cold days went out the window when we could no longer find this product in our stores.  We tried others, and nothing compared.  As always, Amazon comes through and we are happy campers again."

1,"I spotted this Mae Ploy sweet Chili Sauce (12-ounce bottle) in the international section of a local grocery store. It's imported from Thailand. I use regular chili sauce in a variety of ways and I love to try variants such as this. Into the shopping cart it went. Well, my, oh my, this stuf is excellent. It's both sweet and somewhat hot and has a nice variety of spicy flavors dominated by pickled red chili. So far, I've used it on eggs and small frozen dinners. Excellent. I can hardly wait to try it out on meats. This is, indeed, a very interesting variation from my ordinary chili sauce!<br /><br />Gary Peterson"

I don't know which I like more the dark or milk!! You won't believe it is sugar and gluten free as there is no aftertaste or anything artificial about the chocolate. Like Charles says on his commercial..""It doesn't get any better than this"" and it's true!! Grab one and see for yourself."
0,"Seriously?!!!! Have you read the product features? It Says ""Place in large critter keeper for frogs to burrow."" What the hell???!! Does anybody preview/edit this stuff? I volunteer."
1,"I make my own coffee flavoring syrup to save money, however the most expensive part is the extract. This is easily one of the best values I've found for bulk almond extract. The seller is reliable and ships very fast and I will most likely purchase more in the future."
1,"Because of my Danish background,I use a lot of almond products.  I am unable to buy my usual store brand in my new little town, so I got online and started to read reviews.  My almond extract arrived and was put into a taste test in our almond brownies that very day.  We took these to a middle school picnic and SEVERAL people asked what that incredible flavor was in the brownies!  The extract is wonderful.  There is no bitterness at all.  The flavor is true, rich and strong.  The cost is so reasonable and it was well padded in the package.  This will be my extract from now on.  Try it, you will LOVE it!"
1,"This is exactly what I needed.  I use a lot of almond flavoring, & this bottle-size is great for me.  It is real almond extract and not imitation, which is something that I didn't care about before.  After using this extract, I probably can't use imitation flavoring anymore. This extract gives the perfect Almond taste and that little bite that I like to taste in my recipes.  I will be ordering this as long as it is available."
1,Read a lot of reviews complaining about the taste and odor of the product. I have to say....  The product we received looked and smelled like Almond extract. My wife used in her poppy seed bread and it was excellent!
1,I use Almond extract alot aroung the holidays...tired of buying those little bottles for almost $3 each....very happy with purchase.  Great price
0,This product is not what is seems.  I thought it would come in a brown bottle but it came it a plastic clear container.  I would not have purchasedit.  The product is just o.k..
1,I got these to put in the girls' favor bags at my daughter's 3rd birthday party and they were a big hit!  The package that we received had a nice variety with at least one of each princess.  There were more Cinderellas than any other princess.  These are well priced versus what you would pay for them individually at a grocery store.
1,"I bought these to give out as party favors at a bridal shower--my sister got engaged at Disneyland, and they're going on a Disney cruise for their honeymoon, so it seemed like a nice touch.<br /><br />The guests loved them!<br /><br />My pack included: 2 Ariel, 2 Cinderella, 2 Belle, 3 Aurora, 1 Frog Princess, 2 Rapunzel.  So, obviously it's just a random assortment.<br /><br />They make great favors because they're already individually wrapped.  Also, they do come with the little display like shown in the picture here on Amazon.  When my guests were leaving, I just put them out in their display box for them to pick up on their way out, and I used labels to put a sticker for the event on the packages.<br /><br />If you want Pez dispensers that are Disney princesses, this is a great option."
0,I bought these for my daughter's birthday.  She was excited at first but her favorite princess is Sleeping Beauty and there were not any in the entire box.  Seriously?  They can't ensure that there is at least 1 of each princess?
1,I had my doubts but this is a delicious product best used at a party for appetizers or with a garlic parmesan butter sauce over pasta. Cooks quickly[do your homework] and can does not contain shells for presentation but no big deal. Remember there are 5 dozen good sized snails so invite a crowd!
0,"I'm glad that they added ""IMITATION"" to the title of this product because when I purchased it it just indicated that the product was Lemon Extract, but that is not what I received (Also, the receipt that I printed when I ordered shows the title as Lemon Extract, 16 oz).  I received IMITATION Lemon Extract.  The two are not the same.  After I received it, I checked the description and it indicated that it was imitation, but the title was also changed by the time I checked.  Other than that little issue, it was shipped on time and packed well."
1,"I decided to try this coffee and went with subscribe and save to get a discount. I figured I could always cancel if I didn't like it. Well I love it. My only problem is that I run out of it before the next month's supply gets in. It's bold and strong, so if you like that in your coffee flavor, this is for you. Reminds me a bit of a starbucks type of coffee. I Loved It."
1,"I don't get the negative reviews I see here. I've been drinking Newman's Special Blend, but decided to give these a try. I think the flavor is every bit as good if not better, I love it! Very smooth. And I don't usually care for French Blend coffees, they are usually too ""dark"" for my taste. And the price is great...I found them at Costco...a box of 80 for $25.99. And even though there's still plastic to be disposed of, there's not near as much."
1,"I read the reviews and thought to give these a try. They arrived in a timely manner (prime membership). The coffee has a great taste. I use a large mug and make 2 regular cups of coffee out of one pod, add my sweetner, and am a happy camper. This may weaken the flavor a bit but I need alot of coffee in the morning and this hits the spot. Try it - the price is a great deal better than buying 18 pods for $12 - 17 a pop."
1,"I like the flavor of this brand. It has taken me a while to find something I really like. Some of the Keurig options are too acidic for my taste. (But taste is subjective, isn't it?) Reviewers have complained because the cups aren't surrounded completely by plastic; they use a filter-like material instead. I suspect that the traditional filter aspect may make them better. I gave this four stars. To get five stars it would have to be the amazing. I have not yet found a Keurig brand (or lately even a traditional coffee bean) that rates in the Amazing category."
1,"I was not expecting the way these K-cups were made.  The plastic collar on top with the exposed coffee filled filter hanging below is ingenius and I can see where it saves on throwing extra plastic in the landfills.  But, I have to agree with other reviewers that in order to keep each cup fresh, you will have to empth the bag into a ziplck bag or a plastic container with a sealed, locking lid.  That is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  The coffee is excellant and very comparable to the other brands and it is cheaper if you use the subscribe and save."
1,"I have been using the SF Bay French Roast for about 6 months, and have it on automatic delivery.  I like the flavor of the coffee and am pleased with the keureg packet as it is not all plastic. All together a great deal for the price."
1,"I have been using this brand, in my six year-old Keurig, for about a year now.<br /><br />I like the flavor, not quite as rich as I like, but for the price, it's fine.<br /><br />There is a bit more sediment at the bottom of the cup, but for the price, it works for me.<br /><br />The main difference I see between these ""pod-like"" k-cups and the k-cups is a lot more drips after the coffee is brewed. I just wipe under the cup holder and the drip tray a bit more often.<br /><br />I do get these, the 80 count, at Costco for $24.79 a box, coming to 31 cents per cup (compared to Amazon purchase at $33 for 41cents/cup or Amazon subscribe at $33.35, for 39 cents per cup). But if those prices change I would not hesitate to switch to Amazon for my source."
1,"San Francisco Bay Coffee is an especially good French Roast! It has more body and flavor than the French Roast I usually get from Keurig. If it were more reasonably priced, I would most likely change my brands."
1,"Nice strong brew to get your morning jump started!  I do not display the cups since the filter shows, but that is not a problem for me.  Hopefully, it is less waste for the enviroment."
1,Makes a good cup of coffee.  Robust flavor.  This is my second order which I receive on auto delivery. San Francisco Bay coffee is a good purchase.
1,"I love my Keurig K-Cup Brewer, but not so much the cost of the K-Cups!  The San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers is the delicious solution!  Initially, I tried the 36 count box French Roast from Amazon to see if I liked the coffee.  I already knew I liked the price which was almost half the cost of the Keurig K-Cups at your local grocery or department store, but I also loved the full-bodied, eye-opening flavor of the coffee!  Then I noticed the 80 count box which is about a third the cost of store-bought K-Cups and thought I was in Heaven! Of course I ordered it, because I just can't pass up a bargain this amazing! This product is definitely a five-star keeper, and I will continue to order it from Amazon!"
1,I don't drink coffee but I got it for my Husband.  He said it is pretty good.  We just got the Hazelnut in which he likes much better.  I love the price!
1,"A friend of mine in the office gave me a pod of this coffee and I really liked it, hence my purchase of this 36 pack.  This coffee is not as strong to me as this company's Fog Chaser brand, and is good-tasting that not only tastes great but has a nice aroma.<br /><br />The pods are a little different than your traditional plastic K-cup portion as, instead of any plastic around the sides or bottom you have basically a mesh coffee filter holding the coffee grounds. This appears to make a more complete brew, and allows more of the flavor to come into the actual coffee. You will see a dirty residue at the bottom of your cup due to this filtration system vs. a ""clean"" look from a normal K-cup pod. This seems to make sense as the normal K-cup pod has all of the brewed coffee escaping through the pinprick hole vs. the full brewing experience of these pods.<br /><br />As the pods are in this filtration medium the coffee is not air-tight sealed after you open the package of pods. I have put the unused ones in a sealed Ziploc bag to keep them fresh.<br /><br />Several folks in my office have also ordered their own so it's not just me who likes this stuff. I believe between this and the Fog Chaser brand I have found a new favorite coffee company!"
1,I had used SF Bay coffee(French roast) in the past but didn't know it was available for my Keurig one cup brewer. I absolutely love this coffee and have placed an order for more French Roast as well as Fog Chaser. Nice bold coffee flavor with no bitterness.
1,This coffee is great at a great price. This new style K-cup give you stronger more full flavor coffee at a price that can't be beat
1,"We enjoy the French Roast flavor from this maker mainly for the aroma and rich taste. Great for a morning cup. Initially we were worried about drip risks due to the pod's design, but never had a problem. Having the paper filter exposed might be the cause for the richer taste, and some minimal sediment does get past the filter. Not enough to be troublesome. This coffee has been the best value k-cups thus far, and with the Green Coffee patent expired, hopefully we will see prices go down even more, which will lead to more consumption!"
1,I received this order already on time. I was late in writing my review. I alresdy drank this coffee. I love the flavor of the coffee and I like getting a fresh cup of coffee all the time.
1,"Of all the flavors and kinds of coffee, this one is my son's favorite.  I enjoy it, too.  It tastes like a good home brewed coffee, fresh everytime.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IOKA84"">San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Fog Chaser, 36-Count</a>"
1,"With the high cost of K-cups I've tried several different alternatives.  I have the My K cup and the Eco-cup and they both work ok but just not great.  The 3 adults in our home all love coffee and drink lots of it so the cost was getting to be a problem.<br />I've compared K cup prices everywhere, online and brick and mortar stores.  I usually purchase from Amazon.<br />Was checking out what was available and ran across these.  I love the Millstone Fog Lifter coffee so I was interested but read the review and found that they were made differently.  I hesitated but decided to try the 36 ct box.  I figured if I didn't like them somebody else might.  Was still skeptical and thought it might not work in my Keurig.<br />Works perfectly!  The Fog Chaser is delicious.  I like bold coffee and this is good strong but not bitter coffee.  I highly recommend it and others love it too.  We have a Keurig at work and I took one of the bags and shared.  Everybody loved it.  Also, though I'm not usually into ""being green"" particularly I feel that there is less plastic to end up in the landfills."
1,"First time I purchase this Brand, San Francisco Bay Coffee (Decaf French Roast). I bought it thinking they were the original K-cups, and I was so surprised when I opened up the box and saw the presentation, I thought I bought some kind of tea cups by mistake instead of Coffee cups, or it was coffee made for another type of coffee pots, but noooo, they were ecologic and new presentation which I love, and I am very happy with this brand now, I sure will be buying again, very very tasty coffee and nice and friendly presentation, ecologic, excellent Gourmet taste, very happy with it, I love it..!!!!"
1,"Another great coffee from San Francisco Bay. This roast,like their Fog Chaser, are great first morning cup of coffee.  I then switch to their decaf French Roast for the rest of the day. I have used all three of these roasts as a bases for mochas and Irish coffee.  They maintain their flavor very well. Recommend to any coffee lover. Their unique K-cup design uses less plastic which is nice for the environment."
1,"After reading the reviews we werent quite sure what to expect, but we are delighted. The packaging is much better environmentally and the key is that we dont have to compromise on taste or convenience. And by the way its a lot cheaper. The coffee is robust, strong and dark, like it should be ( I haven't tried the other flavors) and it has a great aroma. Of the four people who tried it in our office this morning three are buying it for home and the fourth is concerned only because it is too strong for his family's taste. The packaging is different but works as well as the regular k-cups. I am definitely buying this in the future"
1,This coffee is rich and smooth.  I especially love the price and the subscribe and save is wonderful. it automatically ships every 2 months to me
1,I enjoyed the coffee and will continue ordering it in 6 month time frame.  It had a nice bold flavor and a rich aroma.
1,"Excellent product for the money.  Based on the going price for the K cup line, I was very skeptical.  However, I thought I would give it a try and I could always cancel my order.  I ordered the French Roast because I like a good strong, robust cup of coffee.  I am now on automatic delivery and receive an order once a month.  Couldn't be easier."
1,We first tried this coffee and had some doubts. These were quickly vanquished as the coffee is delicious in taste and very reasonably priced through Amazon. Starbuck's.....look out!
1,"I have used this coffee for about one year, it has excellent taste, on the bold side and the price is right.Also very conveinent to have it delivered to your door every month."
1,"I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the high priced K-Cups so I decided to try San Francsisco Bay French Roast coffee. First, the price is right. I read all the reviews of this brand so I knew what to expect regarding appearance and storage. I must say, it really is not a bad cup of coffee. I usually drink Newman's own K-cups and, in my opinion, Newman's Own is a better cup of coffee. However, if you are looking for a cheaper alternative, I would give San Francisco Bay French Roast a try. Try a smaller box to try it out first."
1,"If you like strong robust coffee, then look no further!<br /><br />The only problem is that you might want to get an airtight container to put these in. Once you open the package that contains 10 or so they fill a room with their coffee blend smell. Not a bad thing, but it's potent.<br /><br />The Coffee is awesome though!"
1,"So now I feel so warm and fuzzy on the inside since there is less plastic being used. However, once you break open the inner plastic packaging that holds the kcups, you now have to store them in a jar so they stay fresh."
1,"Deep, dark, rich flavor. I appreciate the reduced packaging which is environmentally friendly, and as a side benefit takes up less space.  What I really like about these, besides the great flavor (best tasting K-cups I've found so far) is that there is just the filter on the bottom. I've always had some un-addressed concerns about the composition of the plastic that other k-cups are made of, and what may be leaching into my beverage from the hot water passing over the coffee.  Look for these at costco where a 80 pack is 25$ (look around, not all stores carry them), but even on amazon it's a good deal with shipping included."
1,excellent price and very earth friendly. Would recommend this product to everyone nice price to. Flavor was french roast and it tasted like other french roast that I have enjoyed in the past.
1,"Delish! strong tasty cup of joe for an exellent price.I used to buy this same coffee all the time at costco, so i knew it was good."
1,This is now the only coffee I order for my Keurig.  The quality is much better than i initially expected and the price is great.  At first when i saw the k-kup it was different so i expected it not to work but after the first coffee I was hooked.  This tastes to me like a starbucks flavor with the full body boldness.  I would definitely recommend especially for with the subscription discount.
1,I bought the french roast first. It was good so I ordered the breakfast blend for when I wanted a milder cup of coffee. Both are very good and work perfectly in my Keurig.
1,"Rich and smoky. This is a good French Roast. The packaging allows you the fragrance of the ground coffee, which you don't get with standard K-cups. A box of 36 comprises three sealed plastic bags of twelve cups each. They are not resealable, so after I open a bag, I put it into a plastic storage container to preserve freshness. San Francisco Bay Coffee's K-cups will remind you of what it used to be like to open a coffee can. If you miss the rich coffee smell, but you don't use a basket accessory or one of the reusable K-cup accessories to hold your choice of loose ground coffee, consider giving this a try."
1,"From the first cup the aroma won me over. Rich, full bodied French Roast Coffee. Like not having the plastic cups. Just seal the ""pods"" in a bad and good to go.Will probably purchase again."
1,"The subscribe & save service is good, the product was delivered as required and actually did save me money! The coffee is great and has a good full bodied taste, delicious and keeps me wide awake while working."
1,Received product very quickly.  The k-cups taste fresh and robust compared to other Keurig cartridges. I will definitely be ordering for my office again!
1,This is by far..the BEST FRENCH ROAST I have ever had! Aside from that...you can't beat the packaging and the price! Talk about eco friendly. I'm all for it. I will be a forever customer as long as they keep things the same. I recommend the Subscribe & Save program.
1,I will start with the complaint.  This little things kinda do stick to the brewer when you open it after the brewing is over. Not a big deal though.  They brew perfectly and the coffee is wonderful.
1,"The San Francisco Bay french roast K-cups are an excellent choice for anyone that likes a full bodied bold coffee taste. These have a different design that any I have seen, having the filter covering the entire ""bottom"" of the K-cup. The 80 count box is full of smaller packages with a vacuum seal...keeps the coffee fresher. The price is more than reasonable for the quality."
1,This coffee is very smooth and I love the taste!  It was my first time purchasing and was hesitant about purchasing such a large amount since I had never personally tasted the coffee but I was very happy with the taste and will be ordering more!
1,This coffee is my favorite now.  I like dark bolder coffee that stands up to my cream and sugar and this is my new favorite!
1,This is a bold coffee with a smooth taste. For the money it is the beet tasting c.offee I have found in the market .place. I love the easy storable sturdy box.
1,Some of the best coffee I've had. Great if you like full-bodied and rich coffee.  No bitterness and makes a good cup of coffee everytime.
1,"This was my first product by San Francisco Bay, but won't be the last.  It works perfectly in the Keurig and the coffee is very good.  I'll continue to buy K-cups from this company."
1,"When I noticed the packaging for this coffee, I was reluctant to order it.  Because the price was so reasonable I decided to give it a try.  Surprisingly, it was at least as good as some of the coffee in typical packaging, and was much better than others.  Immediately, I revised our ""Subscribe And Save"" to receive this instead of what we'd used previously.  I've made converts of my sister and my mother, both of whom use this now instead of there former brands.  Everyone who tastes it loves it.<br /><br />I failed to mention that we've been using the San Francisco Bay ""frustration free packaging"" coffee for about six months -- both French Roast and Fog Lifter.  Besides the coffee being delicious, we have had absolutely no problems with our Keurig machine becoming clogged or finicky.  Prior to that, for two years, we held our breath each morning wondering if we'd have to resort to the paraphernalia of paper clips, needles, etc,. in an attempt to make a cup of coffee.  We'd even returned two brewers due to the problem.  Now... a perfect brew every time."
1,Like the packaging instead of the plastic k-cups! I believe it brews so much smoother! The price is attractive also.
1,"For my personal taste, this coffee could be a little bit stronger.  However, it has a nice rich flavor and it starts my day everyday.  The unusual K-cup keeps all of the grounds out of my cup because there is no hole poked in the bottom of the K-cup.  The price is also very nice.  I think some of the other brands are slowly pricing themselves out of the market."
1,"For the price is coffee is pretty good, I like a strong cup and it does a good job. I have been using it for about 6 months now and have it on auto ship. Give it a try."
1,"I really do like their coffee products and the prices cannot be beaten.  Yes, as the reviews state to keep them fresh requires a zip lock or container but for the cost savings that isn't a problem at all for me.  This is I believe, my third order of the SF Bay coffees."
1,"Love these streamlined low-plastic K Cups. My biggest beef with the Keurig system is the amount of non-recyclable plastic involved in the single use cups. If this was for home use I would consider the reusable filter system, but as this is for an office environment, I need a tidier solution than wet coffee grounds everywhere. The mesh body works great - great coffee flavor."
1,My husband and son love this coffee.  Great value....and the free shipping really helps too....Have used other San Fransico products and they are all awesome...
1,"If you have never tried San Francisco Bay Coffee French Roast, Your in for a treat. This is a relatively inexpensive coffee, but has all the traits of expensive Gourmet brands.<br />  Very Rich and full bodied, without the bitterness you normally expect find from a French Roast. A full flavored experience.<br /><br />  San Fransisco Bay Coffee comes in their unique style K cup comparable one cup pack's servers.<br /><br />  A must try brand for any real coffee connoisseur."
0,"I shouldn't label myself a coffee connoisseur, but I know bitter when I taste it. I have been testing different coffees in my new Keurig and can honestly say that this coffee is the worst of them all, thus far. No matter what size cup I brew or how much creamer and sugar I add (I normally do not use cream/sugar) the stuff in the cup goes down the drain. What a waste of money. Don't do it... If you can find a small test trial go for it, but don't invest on the 80 k-cup box because you are throwing your money away! Bleh!<br /><br />If you are worried about recycling, use the plastic k-cups to start seedlings in and punch a couple more holes in the bottom so the roots can absorb water. San Fran French Roast is garbage."
1,But it is very good value for money.  Taste is fine and strength is fine.  The cups work well too but I can't convince myself that they use less plastic given the plastic bag they come in.  I do recommend these quite highly however.
0,"I bought this coffee after reading the reviews. I have been a black coffee drinker my whole life, but did not like this coffee. I did not have a problem with the pod.  I thought the coffee was terrible and will probably try to give it away."
1,"This coffee is good and it certainly is worth the price, HOWEVER, there is one downfall.  While it doesn't waste plastic, if you just store your coffee k cups in a basket or an open container, it allows air to enter and thus the flavor will escape.  It's the only thing that will keep me from purchasing in the future."
1,"We've been buying San Francisco Bay Coffee French Roast in whole bean packages at a warehouse store for years, mostly because it was less expensive than the better known brands. To our surprise, we like its bold flavor better than the other brands. I always thought higher prices meant better tasting coffee. Not true! When we bought a Keurig coffee machine last January, I was resigned to trading a taste I prefer and an outstanding value, for the single cup convenience of the K-cups, which meant buying the more expensive brands of coffee in K-cups. Fortunately, the SFB Coffee people have made a single serving cup which fits in Keurig machines. It has the same flat, round top as K-cups, but the cup portion is a mesh filter cup, not made of plastic as with a K-cup. The SFBC cups work just as well in your Keurig machine and with less waste. I take a 16-oz. travel mug to work each morning, and I find the flavor to be consistent whether I make 8 ounces or 16 ounces. My sister-in-law's husband calls himself a coffee snob. He tried the SFBC French Roast for the first time today and was blown away by its rich flavor. He's now a believer and has ordered his first case."
1,Ill be buying these cups again and again. This is a good bold french roast with a packaging that appears more eco-friendly.
1,"I will continue to buy these; excellent price of around 38 cents a cup if you  use Subscribe and Save and the pods are eco-friendly<br /><br />But most of all the flavor is great, as I like my coffee strong, the French Roast is just right - deep and bold."
1,This is a very good tasting coffee and I like the new packaging because it brings the price down but not the taste.<br />One great coffee.
1,The price of the pods was very inviting compared to the Timothy's brand. I purchased the French Roast Decaf for my wife and the regular French Roast for myself. We both drink our coffee black and found it favorful and not at all bitter. I highly recommend San Francisco Bay French Roast.
1,5 Stars on flavor. I was concerned about the design of this 'Kcup' but its sturdy. The only thing that would make this coffee better would be if the packaging was resealable. Its annoying that I have to put them in their own zip lock once the plastic bag is cut.
1,Great coffee at a great price!!  We were skeptical at first because it was inexpensive but this did not disappoint!  A bold flavored choice.
1,The coffee is excellent! Having it delivered makes it convienent and the 80 count lasts long enough for two of us for  a month. Willl definitely keep this coming!
1,"When reading the other reviews, I was hesitant to get it, but I am glad I did!  The smell from opening one of the mini bags in the box was amazing, definitely proving it to be a ""French Roast.""  The taste isn't as strong as other French Roast coffees, but that's fine with me.  This brews up perfectly in my Keurig, and tastes amazing!  I definitely would recommend it, especially if you don't like the stronger French Roast blends."
1,"I was pleased with this brand of K-cup coffee.  Instead of coming in a small plastic (not very green!) container it comes in a mesh-like pouch making the coffee flow through it easier.  i have a hundred dollar Keurig machine and it stopped making coffee from the plastic containers.  Coffee everywhere.  i was ready to throw it out in disgust until i tried this new model of single brewing cup.  The taste is bold, although I prefer bolder, but it is fresh, dependable and works everytime."
1,"I had given up on the Keurig after trying several different coffees as it always lacked in strength and flavor.  I had tried many varieties of the various branded versions of Green Mountain Coffee, aka all K-cups are packaged by Green Mountain.  I finally retired the brewer after the last bad cup having a distinct plastic taste, to a shelf in the basement. Then walking through Costco came across these pods, and different is better!  They seem to have more coffee grounds resulting in stronger coffee, are less expensive, and your beverage is not brewed through a plastic cup.  By far the best coffee for the Keurig and I am looking forward to trying some of the different roasts and blends and really glad to see they are available through Amazon Prime, as Costco is often there one minute gone the next trip."
1,I was a little skeptical at first before receiving these but they turned out to be great! The smell and flavor is wonderful. I would definitely recommend these to anyone.
1,"I love this coffee and will continue to purchase it over and over again.  It takes great with a bold taste and for the price, you can't beat it."
1,"I am a coffee fanatic.  This coffee is delicious!  As good if not better than other brands, and the price is reasonable."
1,"We bought a Keurig a few months back and once we were through the packs that came with the machine (Costco combo pack), we chose these because they make great coffee and fill up the trash can much slower. We usually have 2-4 cups a day and the cost can really add up, but these are great at less than $0.50 a cup!"
1,"We love our Keurig machine but found the kcups to be expensive.  This brand of coffee offers a strong, bold cup of coffee and at a lower price point that most of the others.<br /><br />We have the box of 80 delivered every month, very convenient."
1,"Delicious rich French Roasted coffee in 8-kcup vacuum-sealed bags. The kcup is mesh rather than plastic so the water is not funneled through a small hole but throughout the coffee, making for a much more robust taste. The price is reasonable, too. If you're a Caribou fan, you'll love this coffee -- and it's cheaper!"
1,"Taste will be different for everyone, for me this is as good as Starbucks French Roast and better tasting than Black Tiger and the price can't be beat."
1,We have been using another brand of French Roast and I thought to try this one. I like the coffee to be rich and full flavored that is why I like French Roast. This one really fills the bill. By the by I drink it black so I get the taste of the coffee not some milky mess. I will buy this one in the future.<br /><br />The format of the coffee is also interesting. Not your usualy K cup. I have not had any problems with the packaging. Seems to work just fine.<br /><br />To end this where it should be the coffee is great tasting.
1,"Can't really call these kcups because they aren't like conventional kcups. but they work just fine in my keurig. The coffee is excellent, and at .41 cents a cup (with subscribe and save)  very economical. love them!"
1,"We Bought this product at a local warehouse store in the 80 count box strictly because of the price. We had never seen or heard of them before, so were a bit skeptical, but had no opinion, good or bad. I read reviews after the purchase, because I liked it so much, I came to Amazon because I wanted to see if I could order it online and save us a trip, and I got a real chuckle out of some of the reviews. I'm not sure of why the product got such bad reviews from some people. Yes, it is a strong coffee,and maybe too strong for some people, even our son said it was ""stout"", but we first brewed it on the smaller settings. Now we brew on the largest setting, and have had no problems with it. Also, because of the design, we put the cups in an airtight container to help keep them fresh, so don't store them outside in one of the many K-cup holders that are popular. In the end, I guess it really is true that if you try to please everyone, you end up pleasing no one, and I'm sure there are those in the internet world who could make a career out of complaining, but I would recommend the product to anyone, with the caviat that it is a bit on the strong side, and to be aware that taste is truly subjective, but I think overall, It's a good product and the price is great."
1,"OMG this is such great coffee.  Unlike the other K-cups (which are good), these cups make the coffee take exactly as you would get if you went to a coffee shop like Starbucks.  I just finished my last K-cup and will definitely order them again."
1,It's great to wake up to a cup of coffee that will give one a great lift at a reasonable price.
1,"The coffee is not quite as strong as I had hoped, but it is pretty good. Sometimes the pod gets stuck in the puncture pin and is hard to get off, but I knew that they might not be 100% compatible. Overall I am well satisfied given how much cheaper per cup these are."
1,"Price is nice!! We started using Amazon to get better deals and try new flavors.  I was a little skeptical to try this one as the packaging was so different then all the others, and the price was so good.  So glad we tried it!!!  We like the flavor (we prefers bold) and the rich taste and smell.  The only thing we didn't like was it shipped UPS and we had to sign for it.  Took 3 extra days to meet up with UPS and sign. Like previous reviews make sure you put them in a ziplock bag.  We will be buying this on a regular basis!"
1,"I thought these might come apart in my k-cup coffee machine, but they held up perfectly and the coffee itself is really good. Plus, with less packaging, I don't have to feel quite as guilty about using the single serving size."
1,"I've tried a lot of different Keurig K cup and pod brands. This coffee is the best. And, I love the new style K kup. It's more effecient and more ECO friendly."
1,"I hesitated buying these quasi K-cups fearing they would not have good flavor, not fit right or spew grounds into my cup.  All those concerns were unfounded!  I have tried just about every dark roast coffee put into a K-cup and this is the best and at half the price...that is called value.  I have purchased hundreds of items on Amazon and this is the first one I felt compelled to review because I assume others have the same ""it is too go to be true"" feeling that I had.  Now I am going to use the subscribe and save feature and save a little more."
1,"We liked these so much we did the ""Subscribe and Save"" option. They are a bit bolder than the average K-cup. Good taste, balanced flavors. Every once in a while, because they are not the traditional plastic K-cup, but rather with a mesh type of thing holding the coffee, they got stuck in the brewer. This was only a minor inconvenience and not a big deal at all."
1,"This coffee is my all-time favorite, beating Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts.  The flavor is rich and bold.  The pod design is eco-friendly, the price CAN'T BE BEAT.  I will continue to order this item.  It is the best coffee I've ever had!"
1,Great coffee and I love the way the coffee is packaged in less plastic. Much more environmentally friendly and I can use the filters to start seedlings for my garden.
1,From the time it starts brewing it is waking me up. Fresh coffee aroma and sharp tasting great start to the day.
1,"This is a good deal for a good cup of coffee.  My wife and I enjoy both the French Roast as well as the Fog Chaser K-cups. At just about $0.41 per cup (subscribe&save price), I haven't been able to find a better deal anywhere else. But don't think these are just cheap coffees, I'd put these two San Francisco Bay coffees in my list of favorites for sure. There may be better coffees available depending on your taste, but you're going to pay more for them, guaranteed.<br /><br />The SF Bay cups are a bit different than your typical k-cup and actually I would consider them a bit more environment friendly. While the top of the k-cup remains similar to other K-cups, with a puncture foil top and plastic ring, there is no plastic shell or 'cup' around the base and filter. Instead, the filter is exposed. For this reason, the coffee is exposed to air when you first open the bag.  Fortunately, the 36 cups come wrapped in 3 separate 12-packs. Once we open a pack, we transfer the cups to a ziploc to keep them fresh...no biggee, and still worth the savings.<br /><br />Buying this versus another brand on Amazon or at Sam's club saves us about $20 a month since we drink about 4 cups a day. So our day to day coffee remains this and Fog Chaser, and on occasion, we'll splurge for something a bit different."
1,"Awesome, San Francisco Bay French roast is the best.....without the bitter bite, dark  smooth......smells and tastes GREAT......we love it.....we will be buying more!"
1,"Quality taste at a great price -(especially with subscribe and save). Took a chance on something new and that looked a little different and I'm glad I did.  After I open a pouch of K-Cups, I put them in a zip-lock bag.  My cup of coffee is fresh and delicious.  Try it.  You'll like it."
1,"**See update below**<br />First, I want to say that in general I very much like the San Francisco Bay ""One Cup"" coffee products - their Fog Chaser and Rain Forest blends are two of my favorite K-cups.  As has been mentioned in many other reviews, they don't look like ""normal"" K-cups, but they work in Keurig brewers.  Never had any problems with the brand or the innovative cup design.<br />I also like Amazon's Frustration Free packaging option - between that and the reduced plastic in the cup itself, this is a good less-waste alternative, and the price is great.<br /><br />However - I really don't care for this particular French Roast variety.  I'm not especially picky about coffee - I like a variety of brands, roast styles, and flavors.  Specifically, I tend to prefer ""Dark"" and ""Extra-bold"" K-cups.  But this particular French Roast just doesn't work for me.  Some of the cups have been worse than others, but I find the coffee to be especially bitter, with a very distasteful burned flavor.  With most coffee, I can enjoy it black, but I usually add just a little bit of cream and sugar.  For this variety, I have to add an extra slug of cream, which balance out the bitterness just enough to be ""OK"".  With this amendment, they're not quite bad enough to throw away, but I definitely won't be purchasing more.<br /><br />To summarize: SF Bay K-cups are great - if you stick to the non-French Roast varieties.<br /><br />**Update: After receiving the prompt comment on this review from SFBay's customer service, I gave them a call.  I immediately talked to a real person at the company (not some random call center), who was very helpful and communicated clearly.  This helpful rep was primarily focused on making me happy with their coffee, and to that end, he sent me three replacement bags of different varieties (which I knew I liked) at no cost.  I've tried those and, as usual, they're excellent.  He was also concerned that there might be something wrong with the batch or roast that I had received, and provided me with a pre-paid label to return the old coffee so they could test it.<br />So I'm still not sure whether I got a bad batch, or whether I just don't like this flavor.  Hence my 4/5 stars.  But either way, with customer service of this caliber, it's DEFINITELY worth trying the coffee!  Highly recommended.  My review was therefore changed from 2 stars to 4."
1,"My local Costco has them for $25.99.  Also, my local tax is 8% here in CA.  That brings the total to $28.07 which is actually more expensive than the subscribe and save price here and I don't have to go borderline insane with cart rage at Costco.  But I understand that I may have a unique situation not having to pay taxes on Amazon purchases but on local purchases I do.  Some may have no sales tax or may have to pay tax on Amazon purchases.  With the S&S this is way better than the other option (IMO). With that being said, it is an excellent bold coffee at a good price.  There is a little bit of residue at the bottom of the coffee cup when I am done but nothing major.  With some of the ""make your own cups"", I ended up with a gritty and terrible last drink which deterred me from wanting to use those things.  I even bought a burr grinder in the hope that with a coarser grind I wouldn't get that but it still had a terrible last swig.  With these, I don't dread that last drink and only notice a little residue on the bottom of my dried cup.  These are now my ""go to"" for the Keurig."
1,"I am not a coffee critic, but this is some dang good coffee.  Although I did not get it for the $28.00 others refernce, I did pay $33.00 and feel that is a good buy, at least $12.00 less than Sam's Club for what I feel is better coffee.  I like the little pods, will composts them when I decide to compost."
1,"I just received these 'k-cups' a few days ago. I ordered them on subscribe and save because of the value. I failed to read all reviews, just a few to make sure they were good. When I opened the package, I thought I was sent a wrong item...until I realized these are k-cups, but not the usual looking ones. They are foil sealed with a plastic ring around the top, and the rest of it is a filter. When placed in the brewer, just a hole gets punched on the top, not bottom. Something new perhaps? I tried a cup and I admit, it was very good coffee, full flavor. I will purchase these again and do recommend them. These do arrive in a shipping box, but the k-cups are sealed in plastic bags."
1,"With the recent price hikes for K-Cups, I was starting to question the value of using my Keurig anymore. I saw the San Francisco Bay Coffee OneCups on Amazon and was intrigued by the price and the unusual design. I have been pleasantly surprised by the quality of the coffee. The only downside I have experienced so far is that the pods do need to be stored in a zip-lock baggie since they are not airtight."
1,"I've been a San Francisco Bay coffee fan for years, and was delighted to learn of their one-cups.  The flavor is great and the pods are eco-friendly.  I like my coffee strong and have found the French Roast to be just right.  Don't know what a reviewer meant by ""weak and watery.""  Not so!  I like the price too."
1,"I am so happy with this new economical and more environmentally friendly coffee.  The flavor and aroma are just what I expect from a French Roast -- deep and bold. I keep the pods in a ziplock bag in the refrigerator. My husband and I each drink at least two cups every morning, so we go through a box pretty quickly with no concerns about the coffee pods staying fresh.  The used coffee is much easier to remove from the pods for composting, too.  Fine quality, great price!"
1,"A truly tasty French roast and I love the the packaging--feels more like brewing coffee, allows savory aroma to waft.  Packs a caffeine punch yet delicious flavor. Will buy again."
1,"I was  so excited  to try  these in spite of all the negative reviews that tried to scare me away -  maybe some folks were confused  by the title  however  please note **these are not K Cups -  they  are One cup  made to  work  with  our  beloved Keurig K-Cup Brewers.<br />Thank  goodness -  for any of you  who have  had to deal with  that  puff of  air sending  the K Cups  coffee  grounds up inside the  Kuerig needle  which after  only one use can  clog  the needle. I thought I was  going crazy going through the process of returning  my Kuerig  which was still full of water back to either  Amazon or in my case Costco - because I  thought it was just a lemon -  yeah,  did that 4 times -<br />The beauty of these little One Cup filters is that  they are  not vacuum sealed -<br />I  keep mine in a  large  glass, clamp lidded jar.....The freshness  is  a divine improvement -  and  less waste  in the landfill ...every little bit helps... So far, no bitter taste and I am loving  these..."
1,I have tried each of these New K-cup like items from San Francisco Bay.  This one is darker than the Rainforest blend but not as dark as the Fog Chaser (my personal favorite).<br /><br />Great coffee...great alternative!
1,"I've been drinking this brand of coffee for many years.  I was delighted to see them come out in a Keurig compatible form.  Because they're not really ""K-Cups"" they don't have to pay the licensing fee, so they can sell for a lower price.<br /><br />The One Cup pods deliver the exact same taste as the beans, a good rich French Roast.<br /><br />Because these are pods and not sealed cups, they should be stored in an airtight container or they will go stale very rapidly.  The box is subdivided into smaller sealed bags, each bag holds a few days worth of cups for the two of us at my house."
1,"I like strong coffee. I should get that out of the way first, because I know not everyone appreciates deep, dark coffees. Aside from Dark Magic and Mahogany, this is better than almost every k-cup I have tasted.<br /><br />I may be in the minority here, but I actually prefer the filter-like bottom of these pods over the k-cup for four reasons:<br /><br />1. I've noticed no difference in freshness compared to the Nitrogen-filled, sealed k-cup.<br /><br />2. I don't have to waste filtered water and keep a paper clip handy to unclog the coffee grounds that get stuck in the needle of the Keurig because of pressure and temperature differences between where the k-cup was sealed and where it gets punctured.<br /><br />3. When brewing with these One Cups, the kitchen smells of freshly brewed coffee, an aroma I had missed when using k-cups.<br /><br />4. (And I realize not everyone will feel this way) - warning, nothing but complaining ahead:<br /><br />I had begun resenting being beholden to Keurig. I dutifully sent them money each month for k-cups and each month they found new ways to make me regret it. (Not shipping the k-cups out at all, allowing my package to sit in their warehouse for a week while they assured me it was on its way, consistently being out of stock of the k-cups I wanted and most of all, whenever I called or wrote to point out a problem, issuing a coupon code for free k-cups but then repeating the problem the following month. Their customer service dept is structured in a way that they repeat problems and never resolve anything.)"
1,"great cup of coffee. i MUST have these or else :) i am very fussy about my coffee. these are in a sealed bag, when opened a burst of fresh coffee hits you...which i never had with k cups. they are a whole new way of enjoying your keurig coffee makers. i sooooooooo highly recommend san francisco bay coffee ..especially french roast"
1,These K Cups provided strong coffee without sediment in the bottom of the cup. I think the taste was deeper then the usual K cups and I felt better about not having the plastic on the bottom.
1,"I was a little hesitant about ordering these after reading multiple reviews that talked about the foil breaking and spilling the grounds everywhere.  But I'm glad I went ahead and made the purchase.  The coffee tastes great and after getting almost completely through the first bag (12 ""pods"" in each amazon frustration-free package) I have been very happy.  No spillage and a great, strong and flavorful cup of coffee."
1,"For the past year, I have had a monthly shipment of the Diedrich French Roast sent to my house.  When they discontinued the subscribe and save for that product I was very disappointed and had to find a new french roast.  After reading the reviews I decided to give the San Francisco Bay a try.  I was a bit skeptical about the package and I am very picky about taste, however, I just brewed my first cup and I love it!  It has a really rich flavor that seems to have more of the natural oils that you would find in a french press.  Sounds crazy, but it seems to be true!  The aroma is wonderful as well.  I haven't gotten to the end of my first cup quite yet so I don't know if there is more sediment, but hey, I like french press so a little sediment won't kill me.  I plan to make this coffee my new subscribe and save."
0,"I love the beans, but this design of the cup is not good-- the cups are not sealed all the way and after the first few cups, the coffee starts to get stale unless you vacuum seal the k-cups.  I would say hold off on purchasing these unless you go through them quickly or can find a way to store them."
1,Product is as advertised - a full-body strong coffee.  The difference between this and other k-cup coffee is it leaves a sediment in the cup.  This is not detrimental to the taste.
1,Great coffee and a great price; much less 'offensive' packaging than a normal K-cup; works just like a normal K-cup; no problems.
1,"So nice to get a cup of coffee on my Keurig B60 that isn't watered down like what I get with my K-cups, especially on the large setting. I love the fact that they cost less than K-cups and are more environmentally friendly. My coffee came in 3 sealed packs of 12. I brewed one cup and put the remaining 11 in a quart-sized ziploc bag. Only complaint--not enough flavors. I would like to see flavor variety packs, and other flavors like my favorite... pumpkin."
1,"The coffee is great. The Kcups are not even cups, just a pouch of coffee with a lid.  But it works great in the brewer!  After I am done I even rip open the pouch and compost the coffee grounds."
1,"These coffee pods work great in the Keurig Brewer, and if you like the flavors available these are a good value, but at our local warehouse club (BJ's New England) we got a box of 80 for around $28.00. This is way less than here at Amazon. I hope they create more flavors. As for the ""off taste"" other reviewers are complaining about this coffee is a branch of Peets Coffee. They roast a lot differently than Green Mountain Coffee, the people who bring you the Keurig brewers. I find the coffee to be robust and a lot less bitter than Starbucks, but more bitter than, say, a Dunkin Donuts coffee.<br /><br />I would buy these again and again, but as I said, our local warehouse store had them for even less. Shop around!"
0,I like strong coffee...I LOVE strong coffee and drink it black. This coffee is not really strong but it is quite bitter and has an odd taste to it. Reminds me of 8 o clock French Roast which I also do not like. If you like 8 o clock French Roast you will likely like this one. I like San Franciscos Fog Chaser much better and make it on the stongest setting of my brewer.
1,This coffee is full-bodied and delicious!  The design is wonderfully economical and green.  Save some money while saving the earth! I can't wait to get more!
1,"San Francisco Bay Coffee OneCup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, French Roast, 12-Count (Pack of 3)That is 36 K-Cups. I was worried when they looked different than the other cups. They work and taste great Great deal!"
1,"Because these K-cups are made a little differently, I was skeptical of just how the coffee would taste.  I ordered both the French Roast and Fog Chaser and if you like your coffee to have a robust flavor, you will like both of these.  I have now ordered the larger 80 count boxes of each."
1,"Since I bought my Keurig I felt the coffee wasn't as rich as coffee you slow brew. I bought Starbucks, Caribou and many other brands. It wasn't that I dislike the coffee but I did not get the same satiisfaction.  The first cup of the French Roast I really felt it had such a good flavor.  I'm hoping they start selling more flavors."
1,Love the pod design. Going to try the French Roast next.<br />I am a coffe snob and I admit it! This is great coffee!
1,"Wonderful coffee at a great price!!! I haven't tried other beans, but the French roast is delicious. Happy to have auto ship too - keeps my keruig busy and my taste buds happy!"
1,This is the BEST French Roast coffee from all of the different K-Cups that I have tried!<br />You must try these!
1,"I'm somewhat of a dark coffee snob and have tried MANY dark roast pods.  These are both dark and flavorful and work great in a Keurig.  I usually like to slightly sweeten dark roast coffee, but this really doesn't need any sweetner.  Not at all bitter but still robust even on larger volumn setting.  Order by subscription and it's less than $15 for 36 pods which come vacuum packed in bags of 12 each."
1,As others have written - a K-Cup knock off with nice full flavor - 10oz. setting is good for me - great value - nice bold flavor - best option I have tried so far.
1,"If you like it dark and strong you'll love this coffee <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005ZBZLSU"">San Francisco Bay Coffee OneCup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, French Roast, 12-Count (Pack of 3)</a>! It is my favorite Keurig coffee. I make it on the large cup setting and it makes a perfect cup. For some reason it seems stronger and more flavorful to me than the ""Fog Chaser"" of the same brand. I will definitely be buying more. Keep in a zip lock baggie after you open it. The 'tea bag' bottoms seem to make a better brew."
1,I usually drink this in the af'noon and find it perfect mild bold drink using 1/2 the amount of water required. the aroma is wonderful and the brew flavors expand as you mull the first few sip around in your mouth..the wife also finds it her 2nd choice as Nantucket grabs her attentions 1st. This is not a Kpod but has a mesh bottom..thus I found it tended to lose floavor if not sealed in plastic bag...just an heads up for new customers.
1,Our favorite coffee is Donut Shop by Coffee People and we were curious with this new type of Kcup. Although not the same as Donut Shop this coffee has a wonderful flavor. If you like a strong full bodied flavor use the middle setting otherwise the 10 ounce setting will still give you a very full bodied coffee without being watered down. All in all we will definitely be ordering this again. The best at .44 cents a cup this is a great value.
0,"I tried this coffee because of the price being less than most k-cups here on Amazon.  It's very strong coffee using the largest setting on our B-60 (I think it's 9.25 oz.).  Taste is not full-bodied but rather ashy tasting and flat; it smells and tastes like cigarettes and coffee.<br />Also, I have to hold the machine closed while it's brewing.  The strange non-k-cup pod will not allow the machine to close properly.  The pods need to be stored in a ziploc or other airtight container.  I'd have appreciated knowing they were not standard k-cups in advance.<br />I won't re-order despite the savings."
0,"I purchased this product because the pods looked like they were made in a more earth friendly way. There's no hard plastic cup involved. We break down our cups after use. We compost the coffee and recycle the foil tops. The plastic cups end up in the garbage.<br />This product arrives in several heavy plastic bags for freshness. The filter pods are synthetic so they can't be composted and the tops seem to be made of plastic, not foil. The only thing I can keep out of the garbage is the coffee itself.<br />The coffee tastes good."
1,I love this coffee. I am on S&S and have already ordered it sooner than I have it ordered. I have heard that it is bitter. To me it is not bitter. Maybe it is because I use cream and stevia in it. Don't know but I look forward to drinking and enjoying my second cup.
1,This French Roast is by far my favorite. I like a strong tasting coffee. I also like the new packaging but I am glad that I didn't buy a Keurig K-Cup holder. The way this coffee is packaged you will have to put it in a covered container. This type of K-Cup recycles better too.
1,"I sort of like the built-in filter bag instead of the usual plastic container, and the plastic bag.  The taste, for me, is a little more bitter and less pleasant than the other French Roast coffees offered through Amazon."
1,San Francisco Bay French Roast coffee has a great taste--full-bodied with no bitter aftertaste.  The K-cups appear to be more environmentally friendly than other K cups.
1,Great value and great taste!  Nice fresh coffee aroma when you open the bag.  You will get the best price when you sign up for a monthly shipment.
1,San Francisco Bay French Roast coffee for keurig is one of the best k-cup coffee I have tried.  I recommend it to anyone who prefers the strong flavor of french roast coffee.
1,"I was surprised when I saw the ""kups"", but I had nothing to be concerned about.  The little bags of coffee are very sturdy and the coffee is very good.  In fact the coffee is stronger than the other kups,  I much prefer these bags.  And monthly delivery is perfect."
1,"Like many others, the price point of this coffee got my attention but what's the point of cheaper coffee that's all but undrinkable... Grove Square, anyone?<br /><br />So before ordering on price alone I wanted to see other reviewers contrast and compare this blend to other k-cups such as Timothy's Midnight Magic, Emeril's Extra Bold or Jet Fuel. After all, given the wide disparity of opinion about which k-cup blend is bold, strong or rich in flavor, at least finding common ground with others who enjoy the aforementioned brands you can estimate the appeal of the flavor to your own palate.<br /><br />At the time I placed my order I didn't find any clear indicators from other reviewers along these lines, hence for what it's worth, as one who enjoys the previously mentioned k-cups, I can say that overall San Francisco Bay French Roast measures up pretty darn well to the more expensive brands.<br /><br />Now if cost were not a factor I'm not certain this would be my first choice as this blend has a somewhat smoky after taste and I prefer a more fruity or sweet flavor. But hey, this is French Roast and as such the taste seems well suited.<br />Nevertheless, no regrets...it's a nice bold brew (with an appealing price) that I look forward each morning."
1,Ok so you know the pack is smaller... but dont get too dissapointed it is a strong cup of coffee  will make you go for a while befor you will want anther 1 i am a fan.
1,"I was happy to see these new K-Cup designs because they're at a much better price point than the original K-Cups.  I tried the San Francisco Bay Coffee's French Roast because I like a really dark and flavorful cup of coffee.  Since I also almost always use the large cup setting when I brew my coffee, I want a coffee that gives as much flavor as possible.  I was not disappointed!  The French Roast has a very bold flavor while not being acidic or bitter.  I'll definitely be ordering more!"
0,"This is a heads up for those who like strong, fresh, French Roast coffee... It will not be found with these K-Cups.<br /><br />Freshness. The coffee in each individual K-Cup is not sealed from air. While other brands have a plastic cup and a sealed top, the base on these Cups is the coffee filter. Secondly, all of the K-Cups are packaged together in a single plastic bag. Once that bag is opened, the unused K-Cups become exposed to air. I placed my remaining K-Cups in an sealed container.<br /><br />Coffee Quality. The taste is good but the strength is less than Starbucks French Roast. While the packaging indicates a very deep roast, I did not experience that strength. If a mild French Roast brew is desired, then this coffee should work fine."
1,"I was suprised at the coffee that I ordered had these neat little cups.  What I like most is that they are reusable.  I just tear off the top, then fill with my coffee and put a little piece of foil and cover the top, it works perfect.  I can only drink half and half coffee and my husband drinks regular so he uses the original coffee then I reuse the cups.  He really likes the coffee too."
1,"I love the fact that it does not come in a plastic k-cup style. Eco friendly, and the taste is one of the best. I will be reordering soon!"
1,"I like strong, flavorful, coffee and missed the Coffee People Organic. After reading all the reviews I ordered the French Roast. With all the warnings about packaging and looks I expected the worse. When it arrived I was surprised that it was packaged well and easy to use as any k-cup. The packaging of the pod seems more earth friendly. Most importantly, this is now my favorite brand. It tastes like a good cup of coffee should."
1,Different look but works just fine in my maker.  I love the French Roast flavor.  I will definitely buy again.
1,"From a value/taste standpoint,  this coffee is great. I saw it at Costco (80 k-cups for $25.99) and chose it over the Paul Newman and Starbucks brands that were 10 bucks more for 56 k-cups.  They do look different than the regular k-cups but may be more earth-friendly because the lower part is not plastic. To me, the coffee is robust and the aroma totally fills the house.  So glad I chose this over the higher priced brands."
1,"I love, love this coffee.  The packaging as well!  The flavor is unique strong and good!<br /><br />No more to say it is great."
1,"This has been our favorite coffee for a couple of years now.  Used to buy the 3lb. bags at Costco and was so happy to find it in kcups for our Keurig brewer.  I also love that you have eliminated the plastic ""cup"" portion itself, eliminating more unrecycleable plastic to go to the landfills!"
1,Just tried this coffee a few days ago and love it!  I like my coffee strong (will enjoy a dopio every now and then).  This coffee is strong and smooth.  I can't ask for more.
1,"Like many Keurig users, I have been frustrated by the lack of choices in K-cup vendors. That is, while there are many types of coffees available, only Green Mountain can make the K-cup because of their patent.  Pricing has been held fairly high and steady. It would be nice to have a choice and better pricing.<br /><br />The SF Bay coffee appears to be a good alternative. I have used it for 2 weeks and it seems to be compatible with the Keurig machine. The coffee taste is good. I prefer a stronger taste and am ok with it a bit more bitter. As a frame of reference, I find the average 7 oz cup too weak and use the 3 or 5oz setting.<br /><br />As others have noted, the coffee comes in small bags of 8 ""pods"" each. You have to put the open bag in a ziploc bag for storage because the coffee in the pods is exposed in the filter.<br /><br />I really like the price of the SF Bay coffee. It is good value and feel like I have a choice.<br /><br />I am not a SF Bay employee or shareholder. I just want reasonable pricing and choice."
1,Great coffee at a better price. I like this much better than Starbucks kcup french roast.  This is smoother with less bitterness than Starbucks.  I am sold. This is now my 2nd order. I love the design of the kcups better. There is so much less plastic which results in a better taste. They have a top and the remainder is paper filter. Just pop them in like regular kcups. Better for the environment while cutting down on the harmful effects of plastic absorbtion in your body.
1,"We picked these up at our warehouse club store... They are under forty cents per cup. Delicious, dark roast. I love the fact that each k-cup has an exposed filter rather than the plastic cups. We will be sticking to these!"
1,"I bought this at a local HEB in Texas for $6.99 and was skeptical but alas! this is great in my Platinum Keurig. I had decided not to use k cups anymore because the price is over the top but these will keep me going until Keurig prices come down! I brewed on the 10 oz setting and is VERY bold for me, I wwas even able to add more water through it because it was too bold for me. Love that it doesnt use all the plastic too..."
1,"When I opened the packaging for this coffee, at first I was concerned that they don't look like the normal Keurig K-Cups.  They have a mesh bottom instead of the plastic cover all around.  I tried them in my Keurig coffeemaker, and the cups work just fine, just as it says on the advertising.<br /><br />This is absolutely THE BEST cup of coffee I have had in a long time.  Great flavor, but no bitterness.  Usually with the Keurig, the coffee cup isn't always full, even at the highest setting.  Sometimes, the K-Cups produce a less than full, too strong cup of coffee.<br />Not this coffee!  It is absolutely wonderful and the aroma is nice also while it's brewing.  My husband came home from work shortly after I made a cup to try.  He too, was really impressed with the aroma and taste.  We will continue to purchase this with the ""Subscribe and Save"" feature Amazon offers.  Wonderful coffee!"
1,"""By far the best cup of coffee ever!!!"". I received a Keurig machine as a gift for my birthday and had been using the regular run of the mill products that were available. Then low and behold I found the San Francisco Bay brand of one cup brewing pods and you could not pay to stop using them! By far the best cup of coffee ever, every single"
0,"Coffee is fine.  But I won't buy again.  As another reviewer reported, this is not a standard K-Cup design.  Simply a paper filter below a plastic collar.  Shorter than a K-Cup, so doesn't come in contact with the bottom punch.  Water flows through the filter and into the cup . . . albeit at a faster rate than being forced through the small bottom hole of the standard K-Cup.  Do not attempt to brew a large cup, it will be too watery.<br /><br />Twelve servings come packed in a vacuum packed plastic bag.  When you open the bag, all twelve containers are exposed, so you'll need to repackage them in a zip-lock bag if you want to keep them fresh.  They do not fit in the standard K-Cup carousel."
0,"This coffee was not as good and rich I hoped-leaves a bitter taste even when sugar is added.  Also when op;en the package containing pods, the coffee is exposed to the air-only has a filter around it so smells nice in the coffee drawer of your kitchen."
1,"These are my new favorite French Roast. If you subscribe and save, you get 36 cups for under $15. Do the math."
1,"This review is from: San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Rainforest Blend, 36-Count (Grocery)<br />As the other reviewers have said, this is not a K-cup! I uploaded an image of one of these pods next to a K-cup for comparison. The difference is the filter is exposed in these pods as opposed to being fully sealed in a K-cup. Since the coffee is exposed to the air when you open the package, you will have to seal them with a clip or put them in an airtight bag or tupperware to prevent the rest of the pods from loosing freshness. Having said that, in my experience they are a great inexpensive alternative to use in your Keurig brewer. The 36 count boxes arrived as unmarked brown cardboard boxes, not the colorful retail packaging shown on amazon. Inside each cardboard box, there are three clear heavy duty plastic bags, each of which holds 12 of the pods. The bags are not resealable!"
1,I like this brand because it is closer to a normal cup of coffee than most k-cups. I drink mine black and in my opinion if you make a pot of Folgers and a Folgers k-cup they are nothing alike. This is a closer taste to a cup from a pot made.
1,My husband is very fussy about his coffee and this one is the one he likes best.  Very robust taste.
1,"I like these for a couple of reasons.  First, the coffee is very good.  I like a dark, rich roast and if I put this on the smallest setting for my Keurig brewer, I get a cup comparable to when I go to my favorite local coffee house.<br />Second, I like that they are little pouches rather than the k-cup - less plastic, less waste.  And I've never had one leak coffee grounds.<br />The one drawback, as some have commented is that they may go stale faster.  They are sold in boxes of 12 (Amazon sells you 3 of those boxes at a time), so as long as you just open one at a time and you finish the box within two weeks, it is not a concern - at least I have had no problem with staleness!<br />They are also less expensive with the Subscribe and Save - a win-win all around!"
1,"This is great coffee! Delicious flavor,a little on the strong side for those who like it strong.Love the cups- no extra plastic that goes into the land fills!!! This is a great idea for a k-cup. Keep up the good work !!!!!!"
1,"this is a great cup of coffee for that first morning wake up jo, I do keep it in a lock and lock container and in the fridge and it stays very very well, will keep getting it delivered from amazon."
1,"I order coffee from Amazon all the time because of the good prices, this coffee not only one of the best buys but it is sooo!!! good,  one of the best yet not too strong but strong enought you got to try it to know ,it's good."
1,I love how I can make a fresh cup every morning without wasting a drop!  The French Roast for OneCup for Keurig K Brewers was tasty! I look forward to trying some of the other flavors.
0,"I bought this thinking it was a good deal, and I remember in my Keurig brewer's sampler pack that I like the french roast cups.  So, I ordered this ""deal"".  Do not buy this burnt, after-tasting, muddy coffee!!  Not worth the pennies saved."
0,"Well, lets say that I wish that I had heeded the warning of other reviewers. Since there were so many great and so many bad reviews, I didn't know what to make of it all - thought that possibly this was a fair cup of coffee, but that other reviewers had above average tastes in coffee. Nope. They're just regular old coffee drinkers like me that just don't want a funky taste, and funkier aftertaste. Not too much to ask from a finely brewed cup of coffee. I bought the French Roast...reviews of Fog Chaser were worse stating it tasted like dishwater, ashtray, etc.<br /><br />Let me start by saying, other reviewers are correct that once you open the sealed bag, you must contain them in something else because it will not stay fresh. I just put mine in an empty coffee container because I am just lazy with my coffee...that is afterall why I own a Keurig...ease of use and a quality cup of coffee. Once I opened the outer sealed bag, I couldn't help but think it smelled like something that may have washed ashore on the San Francisco Bay!! I did approach it with an open mind, however, and brewed a cup of coffee.<br /><br />It is easy to use just like traditional k-cups, despite the uniquely different design. I did get coffee grounds in my cup (really just a few), and that has happened to me before so I did not want to fault the product for that. As for the taste...that's where I fault the product itself!!! I gave this two stars because it is drinkable. Barely. I will fight my way though this pack, and never order again!! Let me put into this context for you...the coffee that I have drank at work from the old, stained coffee maker with some cheap store brand grounds thrown in tastes way better than this.<br /><br />There are other ways to save a buck with your machine...there's that giant gray bullet looking filter contraption, there's a small red plastic version, there's the snap on lids, and then there's the aluminum foil that someone recently introduced me to. So here goes...I'll give you a break down of all that I've listed.<br />Giant Gray Bullet Filter - Does NOT taste anything like a traditional k-cup brewed cup of coffee, but by FAR better than this coffee here! The downside with this is that you have to push out the inner part of the machine that the k-cup usually rests in. Dishwasher safe though.<br /><br />Small Red plastic and metal mesh filter - tastes closer to a traditional k-cup, and no popping out the machines inner parts. Have to dump grinds into garbage, but it is dishwasher safe. Good option. Also sold on Amazon.<br /><br />Snap on lids - Amazon sells snap on metal or plastic lids. I have the metal ones. With these, you have to peel the foil off of your k-cup after first use and dump out grounds, and clean them out. Sounds like a hassle, but I guess that I've gotten used to it. Put two scoops of any coffee grounds that you like, snap the lid on, put it in your machine and brew as usual. Out comes a good quality cup of coffee that tastes the same as the traditional k-cup. Possibly because the filter and the cup are what you are reusing. Now someone recently told me that you can reuse the same k-cup over and over again, until the filter gives out. Haven't tried yet.<br /><br />Aluminum Foil - first of all why didn't I think of that!! A k-cup only has a small piece of foil on top that the machine pierces. Really. So obvious that I can't believe that I never thought of it. Tried it the other day. Here's the scoop...still have to empty out a k-cup as you would with the above methods, add coffee grinds, etc. Tore off a small piece of foil, tried to get it just right around the lip because you can't just slap foil over it and have it fit in the machine with all of the excess foil...so it started to feel like a bit of a craft project. Once I got it to fit, I brewed a cup of coffee that tasted like what I have come to expect from a Keurig machine. There were a few grounds that fell into the coffee, but no more than with this crappy coffee!! I will perfect this aluminum foil method...measure, and pre-cut circles one day when I have time.<br /><br />Truly, I have no spare time, which is why I RARELY review a product, but I felt strongly enough about this terrible product, that I should save someone else the palatal distress! Not worth the money! Not worth feeling like you wasted your money when you throw them away! Not worth having to endure 36 cups of sub-standard coffee!! Again I'm no no connoisseur...just a regular coffee drinker!"
0,"sorry, but this coffee was a little too roasted for me, even thoughts of burnt coffee go through my mind.  I'm using it up, but not for fixing my friends a cup of coffee"
0,"Being a huge fan of the ""subscribe and save"" program through Amazon, I decided to add coffee to an ever growing list of products delivered.  This coffee, however, is the worst my husband and I have ever tried!  Beware."
1,THIS COFFEE TASTES GREAT BEST VALUE FOR KERIG SYSTEM ONE THING YOU MUST DO WITH THIS COFFEE AFTER UNPACKING IS PUT IT IN A PLASTIC BAG TO KEEP FRESH YOU MUST KEEP THE AIR OUT DONT PUT IT IN THE FRIGE KEEP IT ROOM TEMP IF YOU ARE A COFFEE EXPERT LIKE ME YOU WILL LOVE THIS COFFEE RICH FLAVOR ALL FLAVORS ARE GREAT EVEN THE DECAF YOU WILL SAVE AROUND 10 CENTS TO 12 CENTS PER POD LEAVE IT TO AMAZON TO BRING US THIS GREAT COFFEE I AM A PRIME MEMBER I SAVE ON SHIPPING AND HANDILING BECOME A PRIME MEMBER AND SAVE WAY TO GO AMAZON
0,"This is the WORST coffee I have had in years.  Either they do not know what French Roast is or someone really messed up.  I put cream in my coffee so at least I can taste that.  Avoid this brew! Does not deserve any ""Stars"" because it cannot be coffee."
0,I thought that this was a great idea for a K-Cup...still do...but after one cup we threw the rest of it away...oh my!
1,"I AM NOT A COFFEE EXPERT BUT AM VERY PARTICULAR.<br /><br />I FOUND THIS COFFEE THE BEST OF ALL I HAVE TRIED.<br /><br />I TOTALLY BELIEVE IN RECYCLING AND CREATING THE LEAST AMOUNT OF WASTE POSSIBLE.<br /><br />THIS DESIGN HAS ABOUT 1/4 THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC THAT ALL THE OTHER BRANDS HAVE.<br /><br />IF FACT,  I USE TO FEEL GUILTY EVERYTIME I USED ONE OF THE OTHER, ALL PLASTIC K THINGS,<br /><br />NOW I AM HAPPY WITH THE COFFEE AND GUILT FREE."
1,"The Rogers Family Company continues to be a tremendous supporters of local schools. As Principal of Jefferson Elementary, I appreciate the kindness and generosity this company has shown us. A few years back they donated $10,000 to our school and most recently they provided our staff a one cup coffee maker and samples of these wonderful Keurig coffees. My favorite is the French Roast. Strong flavor with a smooth finish. Please support this company by purchasing their coffee."
0,"This is without a doubt the worst coffee I ever tasted!  The only reason I ever tried a box of this coffee is that the ""wonderful"" people at Amazon canceled my subscribe and save item of Diedrich french roast.This coffee even smells horrible right out of the box."
0,"Not going to mince many words on this terrible coffee.  It is substantially inferior to a K-cup or Solofill/My-K-Kup as it leaves a LOT of mud in the cup with your coffee.  It's over-roasted, having a burnt, ashtray-flavored quality.  Very disappointed with the product."
0,I have never had coffee as bad as this. If you like bitter flavorless coffee maybe this is for you. I am very disappointed and would not buy it again at any price.
0,"Save yourself from trying these k-cups - not a good substitute for the typical ones, like the ones from Green Mountain.  Bitter taste and unpleasant after taste as well.  Not worth it at all."
0,"Gave them a try.<br /><br />It does brew a cup of coffee but not with the same quality taste as the K-Cup.<br /><br />The difference is not brewing the coffee in the K -Cup is evident in taste,<br /><br />It is a patent work around that for me is not worth what frankly is a trivial cost savings.<br /><br />Yes, sometimes quality matters."
0,"This coffee is awful, very bitter, and I have had others taste it, my sister and my husband, its not drinkable. I wanted to return it, but its grocery, so I am stuck with it. Very disappointing. I bought it because it had good reviews and a great price."
0,"these arent k-cups but can be used in a keurig and go stale, they are getting sued by gmcr for a patent violation"
0,These Kcups?? were flimsy imitation want a bees and were not what I expected at all.  Very disappointed and will not fall for that again.  The coffee was weak and the containers split.  I threw them out after trying a couple.
0,"I tried it when it arrived and did not like it. I tried to send the other unopened bags back but that request was was denied by Amazon. I tried to drink it when we ran out of our reg k-cups and we waiting on the new delivery, it was all I had in the house and I still could not drink it. I gave it all away. The man of house also could not drink it. If you order it for the price as I did, beware if you are somewhat spoiled by good coffee. I am a fan of most Starbucks products, although I am not crazy about the Starbucks k-cups. We have been drinking the Donut Shop K-cups forever. I also like Green Mountain breakfast blend. I spend over $50.00 a month just on Donut Shop K-cups."
0,This was the most disappointing coffee I've gotten for the Kcup. The only way I was able to drink it was to add milk and chocolate syrup to it to cover the taste. Not good.
0,"I love my k-cups and this is the worst I have ever tasted!  I thought most of the reviews sound good....so give it a chance...after a few sips, I threw the entire 36 cups into the trash! Don't listen to the rave reviews...stick to brands you already know and love!"
0,"The cups are smaller and hold less coffee than the competitors. They also are not airtight so will degrade once the package is opened unless used quickly. But even if used quickly they are weak and watery. Actually, more like dishwater. They should come with a warning label. I would have wanted to know that they were weak and watery by design."
0,Open air cups - not a good idea. Better off with real K cups.  Open air cups - not a good idea. Better off with real K cups.
1,"Finally I don't have to be beholden to Keurig's outrageous prices.<br />Nor do I feel bad about all the packaging that goes into the trash as SF Bay's done the OneCup all eco-friendly.  I have loved buying this coffee in bulk @ Costco - now I can use the Keurig my Mom gave me for Christmas last year, Amazon & my Prime(free) shipping so this is a WIN-WIN!"
1,"I ordered this because of the price and when it arrived and the box said ""fits MANY keurig brewers"" I was a bit worried.  But the pod fit perfectly in my B70 and the coffee that it made was outstanding.  I understand the concern about it not being ""airtight"" but storing it in an airtight container works and I like that it is a little less plastic being put into the trash.  This, and my Ekobrew refillable k-cup, are my favorite things for my Keurig."
1,I could smell the aroma of this french roast coffee when I took off the plastic covering the box.  It smelled wonderful.<br />It was just as good when brewed.<br />I like that the pods are not solid plastic and take up less room in the trash and hopefully less room in the landfill.<br />Good product.
1,This is a great coffee. Dark and smoky without being bitter. Combine great taste with a great price and you really have a winner!  The decaf is really good too!
1,"These pods work great.  I usually drink emerals, double black diamond, and recently newmans.  All of these are extra bold and dark. I brew 10oz.  I was concerned about weak coffee body and flavor.  These cups are definitely worth trying.  You won't be disappointed.  The 10oz came out great!"
1,"I've purchased the Fog Chaser and the Rainforest Blend from Amazon, they are both very good, I was thoroughly impressed.  I like strong flavorful coffee, and SFB definitely delivers!  I found the 80 count French Roast at Costco over the weekend, and couldn't pass it up - it is also excellent!  I also like the eco-friendly packaging, and the mission statement of the Rogers family.  Highly recommend it if you like a strong cup of joe!"
1,"We usually buy the Newman's bold K-cups, thought we would try this for something to switch up occasionally, and since this is less expensive, it caught our eye... we are very pleased. Love the ""less packaging"" and it works just fine in the Keurig. Of course, we keep these stored in a ziplock baggie. The boldness of the french roast comes thru without being bitter. We will continue to keep this on hand!"
1,"When I first got these K-cups I looked at them in disbelief. They had nothing in common with the regular K-cups. It looked more like just a plain coffee filter in a shape of a K-cup, sort of a look through contraption. But in the end they worked well and I have to say made one of the best cups I ever brewed in my Keurig machine. Better than Newmans and Tullys, for sure."
1,"A good, strong French Roast with a smooth mouthfeel and no bitter finish. Definitely planning to try San Francisco Bay's other products. I love how much less plastic is wasted. (My Keurig is my best friend, but there's so much waste in most disposable K-Cups!)"
1,"I was a bit skeptical about ordering this coffee, but I was pleasantly surprised. It's very good and the cost is a fraction of what other K-cups are going for these days. I paid less than .50 per cup. I have a Keurig Platinum Edition brewer (from America's favorite home shopping channel:) and the cups work fine in my machine. I prefer a medium roast flavor so I brew the 8 oz cup and it does not taste watered down. If you prefer a light tasting coffee you could even brew the next size up; someone who enjoys a darker flavor may want to use the smaller cup setting. The cups do fit in my Keurig carousel display holder. However, the coffee is essentially contained in a thick paper filter so if you won't be using the pods quickly then you might want to get yourself an airtight container to store the unused pods/cups to maintain freshness. They arrive in a vacuum-sealed package that is not resealable. If you're on the fence about whether or not to try this brand, go for it - you'll be glad you did."
1,"This is right up there with Green Mountain Revv for bold, dark flavor. For packaging, it's genius. They figured out how to eliminate more than half the plastic waste involved in making and using K-cups...and without any loss of coffee quality. I end up throwing very little into the garbage by first emptying the grounds into my compost. My only suggestion for San Francisco Bay Coffee would be to use a zip-lock bag to help preserve the freshness of unused K-cups. Give this a try--its great coffee!"
1,"I was so happy to find this deal on this rich, robust French Roast for my Keurig coffee maker.It smells wonderful when you open the packages-one thing I have really missed with a one-cup system. I will definitely keep buying this product."
1,"I have been using kcups for a few years now and recently discovered these. I was sceptical but decided to try the SF Bay French Roast, Fog Chaser and Rainforest blends. I generally like strong, dark blends like emerils or dark magic. Overall, all 3 of the SF Bay blends are really good. The French Roast is my favorite though. It is strong and has a rich flavor and is not bitter. The fog chaser is STRONG and a bit bitter. The Rainforest is a bit less strong and has a slight bitterness. All are good strong blends but I like the richness of the French Roast. Overall these are really good and are much cheaper than ""traditional"" kcups which is an added bonus."
1,better for the environment with less packaging and by far the best priced keurig cup now. Costco is 8 dollars cheaper though on the 80 pack
1,"I was fascinated by the description of these new K-cups and decided to take a chance after reading the reviews.  I am very pleasantly surprised at the wonderfully flavorful coffee that they made!  I am very particular about my coffee and like only very dark flavorful roasts.  I had not really been pleased with any of the K-cups--some of course were better than others--and had pretty much settled on Starbucks Verona as my favorite, but these are better!  (And--MUCH less expensive!)<br />My Keurig Platinum is at my beach home (only weekend usage and not every weekend at that!) so I was a bit concerned about this style K-cup staying fresh once the individual bag was opened.  A bag ended up staying very fresh for several weeks--of course I resealed the bag with a couple of clips as well as I could--so this is no longer a concern of mine.  I will be a regular consumer!"
1,"This is decidedly the best K-cup coffe I ever had. Before I tried this one, my k-cup carousel was a multi-colored mess with samples from variety of k-cups; from green mtn breakfast blend (just OK) to Emeril's dark roast (fairly decent) to Kona blend (terrible). Now with SF Bay french roast, I dont even need the carousel. These cups stay fresh in their original packaging. The taste is just the way I like it - strong but not bitter. Just a great coffee."
1,"I had not read the reviews and was quite surprised when I opened the package. There are K-Cups! I was about to return them, when I read the reviews, so I just popped one in, and WOW! nice and strong coffee, with less packaging!<br /><br />Will definitely try all the flavors from this great company!"
1,"After an awful experience with those vile tasting Grove Square wannabee Keurig cups, I was very hesitant to try anything but authentic 'K-Cup (tm)' coffee portions.  I had been eyeballing these San Francisco Bay brand here on Amazon for awhile, but hadn't purchased them.  When I saw them at Costco (by the way, they sell them in a box of 80 for about $25), I decided to take the plunge.  And they're not bad.<br /><br />As mentioned by others, the 'cup' design is essentially a paper filter filled with coffee grounds and then attached to the underside of a plastic ring which fits into the Keurig brewer.  The top is sealed off with the traditional thick foil which is pierced by the top needle of the Keurig brewer.  The bottom needle which pierces the bottom of the standard K Cups does not even come into play with these as the water is forced into the grounds.  The coffee passes through from the filter and then directly out the bottom of the  k cup holder and into the coffee cup.<br /><br />Like every traditional K-Cup these are a bit on the weak side, especially as you increase the cup size on your brewer, but I usually brew at the 8 oz setting and I thought these were acceptable.  It does have the (for lack of a better word) 'burnt' French Roast flavor which is surprisinly absent from most so-called 'dark roast' K-Cups and that is much appreciated.<br /><br />My only issues with these cups are the freshness issues.  Since the coffee is basicaly hanging out in the open air (only the paper filter separates it from the outside world) they will change taste very quickly.  I saw someone mention that the Amazon package has them in individual bags of 12.  The bos from Costco has them in individual bags of 8, so of course the manufacturer is aware of the issue of them going bad more quickly.  I personally would prefer they be bagged with quantities no more than 4 or 5 - the quantity I would use up in 2 or 3 days.  I don't have one, I think they look tacky, but if you have one of those 'Carousels' on your counter to display your k cups, I think this product would be completely incompatible with it.  My other issue is that since this coffee drips directly from the filter into the k cup holder on the machine, the holder will have to be washed regularly (probably daily) lest the coffee oils build up and change the final coffee taste even more..<br /><br />I'm generally happy with this product though, and probably will buy it again. with proper storage in an airtight container, I think the economical price evens out the freshness issues."
1,"I drink Starbucks with my own grinder on the weekends, but during the week, due to convenience, I use a Keurig.  I have tried the Starbucks pods, and they are ok, but not as good as some of the other coffees that I have had.<br /><br />This is a strong roast.  It came in 3 bags with 12 ""pods"" in each bag.  They do not use the plasic cups on the outside, but just use a little coffee filter attached to a plastic disc which still fits in the keurig pod hole.  The needle in the Keurig Machine is not touched by the SF Bay pods.  This eliminates those stray grounds from finding your cup of coffee, or potentially clogging up the your brewer.  The filter bag with the coffee in it is not firm before it is used, but the grounds swell during the brewing process and the bag has a much firmer, fuller look after it is brewed.<br /><br />The coffee itself is pretty decent.  I think for the price, I would much rather pay 13 for a pack of 36, than 13-18 for a pack of 24 any day.  After the bag is opened, I put the unused coffee pods into a zip lock bag and have not had an issue with freshness.  I actually tried a green mountain donut house from a previous order, and when compared with the SF Bay, I prefered the San Fran Bay French Roast.<br /><br />EDIT: 29 Mar 2012<br />I usually leave the pod in the brewer until I brew again.  Recently noticed that the SF Bay pods have been dripping a little coffee after being brewed.  Not enough to make a significant mess, but it has been getting on the bottom of my mug and I notice a ring on my desk occassionally if I have 2 cups in the morning.  Nothing that a wet paper towel can't take care of, but just something to note."
0,"Bought this because it was suggested to me via email from Amazon.  So disappointed!  I love bold, dark coffees (French Roast from Tully's, Green Mountain, etc), but this tastes like an ash tray.<br /><br />Gave it two stars because the more environmentally friendly design is clever.  Otherwise, it would have been one star for sure."
1,"Robust, full-bodied and delightful. If you like deep, rich complex coffee, this is the perfect blend for you! Appreciate the reduced eco-friendly packaging too. Added to my Subscribe & Save account."
1,"I bought this as an alternative to the .60 cent K-Cups I had been buying previously and I'm glad that I did. The coffee is good, aromatic, and strong. So strong that I can usually squeeze two cups from a single K-cup. It's also environmentally friendly due to the packaging containing a filter at the bottom instead of plastic. This is a double edged sword though because it tends to result the coffee losing flavor after extended periods (2-3 weeks if left out and open).<br /><br />Overall, if you're looking for coffee that costs $.30 cent per cup, this is a good choice - just be sure to put open bags of it in a zip-lock for freshness."
1,"I bought this coffee without reading through the description thoroughly, so when they arrived minus the plastic cup I was used to I was shocked and ready to send them back.  But I decided to give them a try and I have to say that there is no difference between these and the regular Kcups.  The coffee is rich and full bodied and I like the fact that they are a little more environmentally friendly that the regular plastic cups.  I will and actually have ordered them again.  I normally use my adapter for my bagged coffee, but when I am in a hurry (or for my husband who would rather not fool with the adapter) I use the occasional K cup, or this kind now that I have tried them!"
1,"I will start off saying i'm not a coffee snob, but I think these are great. For the price they can't be beat- and we keep them in a mason jar on the counter (so cute!) to keep  them fresh. my husband also said they are easier to prepare to go into the compost pile.<br />Any reservations on this, please order them and try! what will you be out? with ship and save only $13.50."
1,Strong coffee at the right price the one cups work just as well as the k cups do for a lot less money
1,"I have been searching for a good tasting French Roast Decaf and I finely found it. I also love the packaging,it is easier to store."
1,"Bought a Keurig last year but have struggled to find decent coffee.  We finally resorted to the little refillable thing but it was a mess and a hassle.  We've always enjoyed SF Bay Coffee and these pods are wonderful.  The quality of the coffee is SO much better than anything else we've tried.  Not sure about those negative reviews--nothing watery or dishwatery about the cups we are brewing.  I like the packaging much better as well, I don't want things I consume touching all that plastic that is getting heated up.  The French Roast is perfect in the morning and the Rainforest Blend is wonderful too.  The Company has also made a big commitment to the communities where their coffee is grown, including fair trade and sustainable ventures."
1,"This is some of the best coffee of any kind that I've had in years. I don't write a lot of reviews, but had to give these folks credit for an excellent product. I like very strong coffee and San Francisco Bay French Roast delivers - rich flavor, delightful aroma... yes, due to the unique pod design (which works perfectly with my Keurig brewer) you have to store them in an airtight manner, but it's totally worth it. The only improvement I'd suggest is making their shipping bags - which have a valve like on a regular bag of coffee - zip-top, so I can use them without a rubber band after opening. But I expect that my have price implications, and I prefer the lower price over a better bag."
1,"I just recently tried the San Francisco Bay Coffee one cup for the Keurig and instant brewers. I was a little leery of trying them as many people have been but decided to give them a try. They were a little less expensive and I figured if I liked them it would be worth it. I love the flavor. I don't mind the way its packaged at all. And they work great in my Keurig machine. The only difference I find is because of it being a filter holding the coffee rather than the plastic cup with a tiny hole - after the coffee is brewed it drips a while longer because of the open filter. Not a big deal - just something to mention. The other thing about the SFBay French roast that I bought - compared to the other French Roast varieties - when I use my largest cup setting on my Keurig machine (mine has 3 sizes to choose from) it is not nearly as strong. If I use the small setting, which is about half the amount - it is the same strength as other French roast K-cups. So for me - wanting to save a little money by trying the San Francisco Bay cups - it really isn't working out that way as I use 2 K-cups on the small cup setting to fill my big coffee mug. So price wise - it comes out about the same as what I have been paying for the others. But it is excellent - strong and good flavor. I kind of like that they come packaged in individual plastic bags of 12. And it is no big deal to put them in a little jar or container by my machine. I do that with my regular coffee maker - so this is no different. Not sure why others feel that is a problem. Hope this helps anyone who is considering buying this brand. I would definitely recommend it - and would give it 5 stars on taste - but just did 4 because of it not making a large mug as strong as I like."
1,THIS IS THE BEST K-CUP DESIGN. IT ALLOWS A RICHER AND GREAT FLAVOR TO SEEP THROUGH.  A FAVORITE AND AT A BETTER PRICE COMPARED TO OTHER K-CUPS.
1,"The coffee is wonderful!  Excellent and I would purchase again, great price too.<br /><br />The 'pod' is a bit different design than the K-cups I have been using, but they work just fine with my Kuerig."
1,"Unlike some of the reviews of this coffee I've seen, I did not detect any ""off"" flavor and the coffee is GREAT. I can get two 5.25 oz. cups (actually the smallest cup size is really 6 oz.), from one unit and that lessens the already good cost of this particular brand."
1,Great coffee! Nothing more to say -- good product --  highly recommend it to any k-cup users!  Much more reasonable than other brands!
1,"I really like these French Roast k-cups.  I was concerned having read other reviews and ordered the Fog Lifter first (which I like as well but it is not as strong).  I ordered 80 k-cups which is a great value.  I have no issues with the ""cupless"" k-cup. I also do not find the flavor ""burnt"" or ""bitter"" which I read in other reviews.  I find it to be a full bodied bold coffee.  It works great in my Keurig and the coffee strength is perfect.  Flavor is robust and I look forward to having a cup.  I would recommend this coffee to others who enjoy the French Roast bold coffees."
1,"WE enjoy this blend very much at our home.  It  has the good strong coffee taste that i like.  Works well both ways,  with or without creamer."
1,"Please see my complete review for all the San Francisco blends under the Rainforest blend.  Except I forgot to mention the Fog Lifter<br />I would put in the little lighter than this French Roast, which I believe is the best Bold I have tried.<br />San Francisco Brand is the only K-cup brand we purchase now that we have found all the PLUSES!"
1,"I purchased ""San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, French Roast"" about 2 ½ weeks ago. Since then I've compared it to ""Green Mountain Nantucket Blend"", alternating between the two with an occasional ""Tully's Italian Roast"" mixed in.<br /><br />My wife prefers the slightly bolder blend of the Tully's; I prefer the Green Mountain. Both of us have found the ""San Francisco Bay, French Roast"" to be a good blend that's robust while not overwhelmingly bitter. It may well become our coffee of choice.<br /><br />Personally, I find the ""Tully's Italian Roast"" and ""Newman's Own Special Blend"" to have a bit of a biting after taste that I don't experience with the ""San Francisco Bay, French Roast"".<br /><br />I have friends who only use K-cups. I've given them samples of the ""San Francisco Bay, French Roast"". Their taste runs more to the bolder coffees. Both of them love the coffee.<br /><br />Several reviewers have commented about the sediment left in the bottom of the cup from the ""San Francisco Bay, French Roast"". I agree with them, there is sediment; it's just like I experience with the ""Tully's Italian Roast"" and ""Newman's Own Special Blend"". That seems to be typical of some of the bolder blends and especially the darker roasts. It may also be that the beans are ground finer on these blends to extract more flavor in the brew cycle.<br /><br />These are not traditional K-Cups but they'll work just as well in your Keurig coffee maker. I actually think I get better water flow through the coffee with this new design. My only complaint is the need to keep them sealed rather than in the carousel where I normally store my K-Cups. The cups are packaged in a very heavy plastic bag, which is properly vented for storing coffee. I cut the top enough to remove one cup at a time, then fold over the top and put a clip on it. We drink enough coffee that the 8-cup bag only lasts a couple of days. It's really not a big deal.<br /><br />Should you try it? Probably.<br /><br />I enjoy good coffee, even more when it's reasonably priced. I'm not a ""coffee snob"" and I'm willing to try new things. For me, the ""San Francisco Bay Coffee"" has been a good experience. I'll probably try some of the other blends as well. And, although I bought an 80-cup pack for this first try, I'm happy I have the choice of 36 or 12 count packs to try on the other blends."
1,"The San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, French Roast, 36-Count was a great value. This is my second time buying the SFB brand. I like the Fog Chaser much better and will stick with that one next time!"
1,"The trouble I find with a lot of the Kuerig cups is that I like my coffee strong and most cups aren't strong enough if I want a full cup of coffee without using two cups at a lower volume. With these, I get the strength I want with just one."
0,"The concept for packaging this coffee was great.  Simply putting the coffees in a ziploc bag preserved their freshness and the idea that I was putting less plastic in our local landfill was great as I live in a little village on the Yukon River.<br /><br />However, I found this roast to have a very bitter aftertaste.  I generally enjoy a full, dark roast and I like the bitterness of coffee.  That's the whole point.  But I was really unhappy with the finish in this particular French Roast and won't purchase it again.  I am slowly working my way through the 80 count I bought, on days when I have a taste for added creamer flavors.  This isn't a comment on any of the other San Fransisco Bay products, as I haven't tried them, just this particular roast."
1,"I love the fact that this delicious, strong K-cup ready coffee comes with an exposed filter.  I'd been trying to cut the bottoms off of the K-cups I had been using, in order to recycle them. (good intentions, but not realistic!) The fact that they don't even have the bottom portion of the ""regular"" K-cups while still maintaining excellent, rich flavor makes me a convert.<br /><br />This flavor, French Roast, is bold, strong and just what I'm looking for as a morning coffee, and holds up very well as iced coffee as well.<br /><br />I'll be buying many more of these!"
1,"This is a great waste saving package 'k' cup. Lovely strong nutty flavor. Be careful to seal the cups between use. To me, this coffee is fresher than standard k cups. Definitely worth the added hassle of reselling the pack."
1,"Coffee is bold and very good. I like it better than Newman s and Folgers K-Cups. It is a bargain for the price. Also it is great that the ""cups"" are not plastic but just a filter :)My favorite k-kup for sure!"
1,The cost of the San Francisco Bay K-cups is the lowest I have been able to find anywhere.  Good coffee too!  This deal is hard to beat.
1,"I am a coffee snob.  This coffe is a mild french roast.  It works great in my Keurig.  This company has the right idea of less garbage, by using less plastic.  They prices is very resonable also."
1,I tried these alternative k-cups for the first time and thought they were pretty good. I don't think I'll be buying the traditional k-cups again. The French Roast were nice and dark roasted.<br /><br />My 80-pack came with 10 bags of 8 pods. When I opened a bag I put the ones I wasn't going to use right then in a ziplock bag. Not much hassle to save 50% on the cost of k-cups.
1,"PURCHASED FROM MY FAVORITE INTERNET PROVIDER, Amazon.  I am a coffee nut...love a great cup of coffee.  If you want a full bodied coffee with great aroma and taste (not bitter), then I strongly suggest San Francisco Bay French Roast."
1,"If you like Star Buck coffee, you'll love San Francisco Bay coffee. Nice bold taste. Fog Chaser is very strong. It will wake you up. French Roast is milder than Fog Chaser, but still has a great taste. It make Green Mountain taste like flavored water."
1,"If you like strong coffee, this is the best one I have found. To keep it fresh, you probably want to put it in a zip lock bag after opening the 12-pod packs."
1,Love this coffee and love the price!I love the smell when I open the container and it is my new favorite coffee. I would recommend this to anyone. I keep it in a zip lock bag after opening to keep it fresh until used.
1,I work from home and drink aobut 5-6 cups off K-Cup coffee a day. This is good tasting coffee and the lowest price K-Cup on the market!
1,"I did not buy these from Amazon, but apparently will in the future.  I was in my local membership-required-big-box store (am I allowed to say Costco?) when I saw this stuff for about 27 cents per serving.  Since it's very easy to return stuff there, I bought it.  As others have commented, it's unusual looking, in that just the familiar looking K-Cup ring and foil at the top are there.  The plastic cup around the bottom is missing.  But that doesn't matter and it actually creates less waste and probably costs less to manufacture.<br /><br />Off course, being green doesn't matter if the coffee tastes bad.  In this case, it does not.  It's got to be one of the two best French Roast K-Cups I have ever had.  Full of flavor, without being bitter or burnt.  I went back to the store a few days later and they had sold out and they are not sure of plans to get more, so it looks like I will continue to buy my coffee from Amazon, but instead of my usuall brand (Green Mountain French Roast), I will be buying these."
1,"These K-Cups arrived promptly after ordering; the are convenient to use, and the coffee tastes great. Highly recommend the product. Have had no problems."
1,"This has become our daily coffee. We were previously Starbucks (brewed at home) coffee drinkers, although I will say these are not quite as strong as Starbucks brewed coffee...not weak either though. I usually buy them at our local wholesale warehouse, where the price is a little better, but I come to Amazon when I am needing it fast and don't have time to go to the store. It makes a good cup of coffee, that I happily serve to guests. The only down side is that the individual packaging does not allow for display. Not a big deal."
1,"The coffee is very good.  The cup looks different than the standard k-cup but who care as long as the coffee is good and cost effective. With monthly subscription,  it saves me about $10 a month for regular drinking for 1 person.  Do the math if you have more people drinking.  Recommend the coffee and subscription"
1,The lowest price I could find for k-cups and still tasted delicious!!! K-cups fit my Kuerig and deliver the same results!  I tried several flavors and everyone is true to taste.  I will order again!!<br />Why pay more for the exact same flavor as the other brands??
1,"We purchase on Subscribe and Save, 3 boxes a month.  I like the little filters instead of the pods. The price is great. My husband thinks the coffee is stronger than our previous French Roast.  However I really like the robust flavor and, at this price, he just adds a little more cream.  If this had resealable bag I would give four stars. We had to buy a large airtight jar."
1,"I'm generally a fan of dark roast coffees, and this is one of the better K-Cups of that variety.  Perhaps not as strong as Emeril's but better than the Starbucks French Roast K-Cups.  (None of the K-Cups I've found are as tasty as a well-made Aeropress cup, but the ease-of-use, cleanup, and ability to change varieties for each person more than make up the difference.)<br /><br />The form factor doesn't seem to have any significant disadvantage for my.  This box contains 3 12-count sealed plastic bags (each with one of those one-way air valves).  I've kept the ""open"" dozen in a Gladware tub.  All's well."
1,I like this coffee and the design of the cup. Not the same as a K-cup but works just as good. I like the Fog Chaser better than the French Roast but this is a pretty good tasting one too. Can't beat the price..15.99 for 36 is much cheaper than any other on Amazon.
1,Always in the market for a cheaper k-cup (and living in San Francisco) I was happy to have stumbled upon the  San Francisco Bay brand. I was worried about the weird shape at first but it still works in the brewer. I like that the packaging is trimmed down so I don't feel as guilty about the environental impact of overpackaging  (told you I live in SF!)  The French Roast is very bold and at first I was unsure...I think I like  it just fine but plan to try another roast next time. It also tastes a bit more acidic than other brands but that isn't such a bad thing either. I think I am getting used to it. My problem is that I switch from several different brands all the time so I may y always notice that difference. I recommend this and plan to order this many more times!  I would give it another half star if i could!
1,"I enjoy a good cup of coffee, when I found these little gems I was hesitant like other people. We were all brain washed thinking we had to use the wasteful K-cups. As they continued to raise the price of coffee up and up and up I was trying different ways to utilize my Keurig coffee maker, purchased refill cups etc you know how that works. Well this is by far the best way to enjoy a good cup of coffee, the way the cups are packaged does not bother me at all, I don't let it sit around to get stale , I drink it. If you notice the bags are vacuum sealed and a zip lock bag would not work people. If it is not broken don,t fix it, and this is not broken so just keep these prices affordable, and keep the quality of the coffee just the way it is."
1,"I have tried a large variety of french roast k-cups over the last 4 years, even the re-usable k-cups where you add your own coffee, and this is by far my favorite."
1,I really like this coffee - no problem with the bags being open as they are long gone before they would have gone stale.  They work well in my Keurig B40 - I'm wondering if some of the people who've had trouble haven't perhaps used these in the really tiny version of the brewer that does not have a water reservoir.  Love the price and love the coffee.
1,"I was surprised when I got these from Amazon because like the other reviewers said, the cups do not look like traditional K-Cups, because the bottom of the cup is a filter - not plastic like the traditional ones. But don't let this bother you - they worked just fine.<br /><br />The coffee was better than most - strong flavor. One of the better stronger brews.<br /><br />The only issue I see is that after you open the package, you must use the cups quickly or they will get stale. Some people like the K-Cups because they don't use that much coffee and so it is always fresh. But if you are like me and drink a lot of coffee, I don't see how you can go wrong with this coffee."
1,"Yup not a K-Cup. If you don't like the non-plastic cup, then don't buy them.<br /><br />For our family, we like the taste, and the price. We've tried both this French Roast and the Fogchaser, and enjoy them both. We have not had any issues with grounds in the coffee. We keep them in a zip-lock bag after opening the 12 pack bag, so we have not had issues with them tasting stale (we drink them in about 2-weeks). I'm guessing that these cost less since they don't have to pay a royalty to Green Mountain Coffee Roasters for using the K-Cup name and design.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fairly inexpensive alternative to the K-Cup, these are a great choice!"
1,"Great bold french roast for the Keurig coffee machine. The flavor is bold and strong. If you are  a french roast fan, this is the best I have had for the Keurig yet. Even more, the cups are much more environmentally friendly than most of the others on the market because hey use much less plastic- just a small ring and the with a soft biodegradable filter attached."
1,"I bought these in an attempt to get some Kcups at a reasonable price that were NOT instant coffee. While I'm not picky about coffee, I'm not going to waste my  time with instant-coffee Kcups no matter how cheap they are. Using Subscribe&Save, these are half price compared to what I pay at Costco for my husband's favorite Kcup: Starbucks Cafe Vienna. They do not have the white plastic ""cup,"" instead the part under the foil top is coffee-filter material in a curved-bottom shape. So only the foil top is pierced when the machine brews. I like to think this means less waste! They are packaged in thick sealed plastic bags in groups of 12. Aroma is extremely fresh, taste is great, just as strong/rich in my opinion as the Starbucks ones. Wish they came in more flavors and larger quantities!"
1,"I'm certainly no coffee snob but I do know what I like... and I very much like the SFB french roast ""k-cups"". I do the S&S on these and it's pretty much the only coffee I drink now. The aroma is fantastic and the flavor is great. As for the folks bemoaning stale coffee, put the things in a tupperware container after opening the plastic bag. It's not an intellectual challenge."
1,"This coffee had all the rich flavor that I expect from a dark roast and minimal bitterness.  I suspect most folks are checking these reviews to find out if these weird cups actually work in a Keurig machine.  They do.  I had no issues.  The unexpected benefit was the great coffee aroma.  I love the Keurig system, but I miss the smell of coffee before it is prepared.  The aroma is back with these as soon as you open the plastic bag that they come in.  As much as I enjoyed the aroma, I felt compelled to store these things in another air-tight container, lest they lose their freshness. I also decided that I could not keep these cups in the rotary K-cup holder that we keep next to our machine.<br /><br />Despite storage issues, I would get these again for their flavor, aroma, and price."
1,"Function: these cupless k-cups work perfectly in our Keurig B130 (the business version of the small personal brewer) which makes only a small cup.<br /><br />Less waste: We were really disappointed when we discovered that the plastic k-cups aren't recyclable. These are a terrific low-guilt, more responsible alternative.<br /><br />Less storage space: they take up much less room to store. I buy k-cups in quantity to save money, but then I had to dedicate a large cabinet to storing them! Not so with these, partially because they're less bulky and partially because...<br /><br />Great Price: these k-cups are much less expensive than other brands, especially at the Subscribe & Save price. At this price, I can buy less at a time and still pay less per cup than I could finagle with coupons & sales & bargain-shopping the major brands.<br /><br />Taste: Amazing!  I love a good dark French roast, and these are the best I've ever had.  Dark & rich but not bitter.  In fact, this morning I forgot to pour the creamer before I took a sip and I was amazed that it tasted really great.  I've tried to go without creamer before - I'd like to get used to coffee without it - but could never stand to...until I did it by mistake this morning and it was so smooth I drank the whole cup that way.  Trust me, this speaks volumes.<br /><br />Conclusion: I'm keeping my subscription, and I just increased the frequency of my deliveries because we found we drink these more than the regular k-cups. How can you beat cheap, tasty, less bulky, and less waste?"
1,"As the other reviewers have said, this is not a K-cup! I uploaded an image of one of these pods next to a K-cup for comparison. The difference is the filter is exposed in these pods as opposed to being fully sealed in a K-cup. Since the coffee is exposed to the air when you open the package, you will have to seal them with a clip or put them in an airtight bag or tupperware to prevent the rest of the pods from loosing freshness. Having said that, in my experience they are a great inexpensive alternative to use in your Keurig brewer. The 36 count boxes arrived as unmarked brown cardboard boxes, not the colorful retail packaging shown on amazon. Inside each cardboard box, there are three clear heavy duty plastic bags, each of which holds 12 of the pods. The bags are not resealable!"
1,"This coffee is very good, it has a nice aroma and a good strong flavor.<br /><br />I also like the ""minimalist"" k-cup design, but have a couple complaints with it.  Since the individual pods aren't sealed, you have to keep them in a sealed package to prevent spoilage.  It would have been nice if the plastic bag they came in was re-sealable.<br />Also, since the coffee doesn't just come out of a small hole in the bottom of the pod, the first cup you make with these will wash all the stray grounds out of your machine and into your cup.  Be forewarned that you should wash the pod holder before using these.<br /><br />Overall I like the product, just be careful about the different pod shape."
1,"Unlike many others, I haven't paid much attention to the price of K-cups because I've been on Amazon's Subscribe & Save for K-cups for over a year now. Wanting to try another brew for a change prompted me to try these. I'd used this brand before in whole beans because they were at Costco so I knew I would like. Wow! These are very different from regular K-cups. Like another reviewer said, the aroma wafts like real brewed coffee and the flavor is rich and bold. I am so happy I took the chance on this. Subscribe and Save is the way to go!!!!!!!"
1,"I have been purchasing San Francisco Bay Whole Bean French Roast for years, for the money it has been a very consistent good cup of coffee. I bought a K-Cup brewer to please my guests. K-cup brewing really provides something for everyone without throwing pots of coffee down the sink.<br /><br />But I must admit that I didn't fall in love with all the K-Cup selections out in the market no matter what the price, brand or blend. They were generally hitting a 6 to 8 on a scale of 10. I tried the San Francisco French Roast last week and I really loved it. For me, it is the best out there in the K-cup world."
1,"Though the lower than usual price caught my attention, I was concerned that this coffee, marketed for Keurig, was not packed in the common cups.  Rather, the coffee is in small bags.  Not to worry! They fit as well as the usual cups do. I was so pleased with my first order, I have ordered several more...and given some as gifts to other Keurig fans."
1,"At first I wasn't sure but I figured, at the price i'd give it a try.<br />I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor and quality of this coffee.<br />The K-Cup design is somewhat different and you will need to store<br />the coffee in a zip lock bag after opening the bag containing the<br />coffee. Other than that, it's quality coffee at a very nice price.<br />We are talking $0.41 each rather than $0.50+ each.<br />You can't beat it!<br />I'm now buying the 80 count and enjoying it even more as<br />the price is now $0.35 each.<br />Try it...you'll like it!"
1,"I ordered this to see how it compared to the Fog Chaser. It is a good French Roast coffee and is comparable to the Tully's that came with my machine. French Roasts are good for K-cups because you stronger flavor out of one, however, for overall flavor this is not as good as the Fog Chaser.<br /><br />Price is excellent and the packaging is great as it has a much lower waste profile. It's also much easier to compost the grinds with these."
1,"This hot sauce is not to overwhelming and has a nice garlicky flavor to it. Awesome taste or the Moruga in there, this hot sauce is liquidy so it had the dot plastic thingy in the middle. I put it on everything and i would definitely order more."
1,"So I'm a pretty big fan of GT Dave's Trilogy and Synergy lines of bottled kombucha, and, as anybody familiar with true, natural kombucha knows, it has to be kept refrigerated, or else so-called bad things could happen (like continued fermentation).  This brand does not need refrigeration, as it has gone through some sort of processing (pasteurization perhaps, yeast removal, I don't know really) to negate the need for storage and shipping complications.  Of course, the downside is that health benefits attributed to natural kombucha are somewhat lost here, since processing kinda tends to that, but it still contains bacteria cultures (at least according to the label), it's still ""organic"" and most importantly, it still retains that vinegary kick that sort of defines the kombucha taste.  Make no mistake, this product is far sweeter than GT Dave's, 60 calories for an 8.4 ounce can (vs. 60 calories for a 16 oz bottle of GT's ), but it's still got some kombucha-y flavor.  It's perhaps not as ""yeasty"", and is certainly missing any hint of alcohol from the original fermentation - I'd need a bottle of GT's to compare to be sure - but it goes down nice and easy anyway.  It would be a good way to get into drinking kombucha for someone that isn't used to it yet.<br /><br />So, it's not a replacement for GT's or any other naturally fermented and bottled kombucha product (several come to mind that have pulled from shelves), but it *is* tasty, organic, shelf stable, and convenient, and I like it for that reason.<br /><br />As for the flavor, I've tried two (of many) from this brand now, the ""traditional"" and the ""green tea and lemon"".  So far my preference leans to the ""green tea and lemon"" just because I like the tartness of the lemon.  The ""traditional"" hints at stereotypical sweet tea, with that kombucha-y vinegar kick, but it's just a little sweet for me.  Of course, it's better to find a sample around town before committing to a case, if possible, at a health-food store, or more progressive grocery chain.  I'll probably order another case of the green tea and lemon when I finish off the first one."
0,"This is way too sweet and artificially fizzy.  Somehow the pasturization process took out the goodness of the real Kombuchas. I've found that GT's Synergy is one of the best.  It also contains raw Chia, an outstanding energy food. Watch out for others, like this Wonder Drink, that try to use the same words and imitate the quality companies that produce Kombucha the way it is meant to be drank. Find one of the GT's Kombucha products and compare for yourself."
1,"Will this drink give you good health, great longevity, inner serenity and incisive mental clarity?  No, no, no and no.  Does it contain live organisms?  It is pasteurized, so again no.  Is is manufactured and canned by special mystical people high in the Himalayas?  No.  Isn't cane juice just sugar?  Yes.<br /><br />If you are looking for a funky tasting beverage where the taste horrifies yet refreshes and leaves you wanting more then give this a try.  The citrus/vinegar combo is weird at first but now I'm hooked.  As I am on a diet I like that the cans are small so I can get my taste fix yet not go crazy on the calories."
0,"This drink is tasty and made with some pretty simple and natural ingredients. However, carbonation is added (in true kombucha it is a natural part of fermentation) and the drink is obviously pasteurized, which destroys any live culture (and thusly the probiotics that make kombucha popular as a health drink)."
1,"When I first tried this, I shrugged my shoulders and went ""eh"".  Wasn't sure about it.  Then I started sipping more, then a little more until I really understood the Kombucha thing!  I'm not a Kombucha connoisseur by any means but I do enjoy drinking it.  I don't have any idea about the whole pasteurized, non pasteurized concept, but what I do know is that this particular Kombucha makes me feel great.  Can't explain it, but I guess you can say it ""wakes me up"" or makes me feel more ""alert"" or something.  Whatever it is, I enjoy it and I enjoy the way it tastes!  It's definitely an acquired taste but my husband and two daughters love it, and that's saying something!!<br /><br />We have it on subscribe and save.  Love the fact that we can satisfy our need for something bubbly while receiving the added health benefits from the green tea and enzymes!  Good stuff!"
1,Very good  and arrived on time.  I will order this product again for me and my husband's use.  Very health product too.
0,"First, this is a poor-tasting kombucha.  Worse, ""Wonder Drink"" Pasteurizes all of their products, eliminating any live cultures and therefore much of the reason to drink kombucha in the first place.  I do not recommend this product, and hope that Amazon carries a real kombucha in the future."
1,"This product exceeded expectation, makes you feel better after drinking.  Will buy again.  Thank you Dr. Oz for talking about it on your show!"
1,"Served cold this drink tastes very good,Would not be good warm or even at room temperature.But ice cold out of the fridge it is a great tasting ,very refreshing  drink.A much better substitute for ""soda pop"".<br />Price is right too.I enjoyed this product very much"
1,"Although possibly not a true Kombucha, although I am not a pro on the subject, the taste is great.  I have had the hard core kombucha and it took some getting use to, but filled with probiotics and other essentials.  This is a good introduction to the whole kombucha thing.  I'd probably read up to see just how valuable it is compared to other kombuchas.  Price is fair and shipping was relatively fast."
1,"I love the carbonation and tangy, lemony flavor of this drink.  I like the fact that it's not too sugary, but gives me the feeling that I'm drinking a soft drink.  This drink is not for everyone, you have to have an appreciation for ""kombucha"" flavor.  It has a ""tangy"" flavor.  Very refreshing."
0,I DID NOT LIKE IT. IT MADE ME COUGH EVERY DRINK OF IT & DID NOT TASTE GOOD I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY ABOUT IT...
1,This Grey Poupon is likely to be sold out at our local grocery store.  No other Dijon compares so far...  We tried another brand and it was awful.  We love this in our home and stock up all the time.
0,"Do Not Buy!<br />I bought this case of 12 bottles 2 months ago and have consumed a few of them. At first I noticed that the bottle looked different than the ones I've seen before. The bottles are opaque instead of the clear plastic I have seen in the past and is pictured. Secondly I thought the taste wasn't as strong as I had remembered but I didn't have any other mustard to compare it to. The more I used it the more convinced I became that it was not truly Grey Poupon since it just tasted like cheap dijon mustard to me. At Christmas I received a jar of real Grey Poupon and compared the two, no question they are not the same. I cannot return this item and I have used a few bottles. I would not buy again and I would not recommend it to anyone.<br />One note, I purchased this product through Amazon but Sold by: J&M Goods, LLC<br />Not sure if that makes any difference now you can buy direct."
1,"Anyone remember that old joke about Grey Poupon that involved two old sophisticated men in a limousine?  I remember that commercial with fond memories, and in fact is the main reason I avoided eating it for so long for fear that I'd become exactly like those men.  Good thing it was just a big joke and *anyone* can eat this stuff without desiring to feel high and mighty!<br /><br />The taste is good but it's not as appealing as it used to be.  I believe they're either making it cheaper these days or simply have changed their recipe for the worse.  Either way old time fans of this product that have been neglecting it over the years may be in for quite the disappointing surprise when they go to eat this overpriced stuff."
1,I've tried many different flavored coffees but this is by far my favorite.  I used to buy Gloria Jean's Southern Pecan Parfait (still really like that flavor) but this is much better.  I mix it with regular coffee to not only save but it makes the taste a little more mellow.  Soooo good!!
1,"These are the best pumpkin seeds out of several brands I've tried.  Other brands have been roasted too much or too little or didnt use the right seeds or something...Im not sure.  what I know is that these taste the best to me.  Ive eaten many many bags of these and while it is true that some bags seem more salty than others, on the whole they are very good.  i dont know if its the seeds or the oil or the amount of roasting.  whatever...they're good."
0,Got a 6 ounce bag at Wal-Mart for about two bucks.  Stands to reason you can get a quantity for a big discount?  Just look at the price of these seeds.  Way too much money.  No thank you.  Nutsonline has got better deals.
1,I bought these and the Eden brand and find these taste better. So I recommend the Good Sense brand. These are moist and the Eden's are more dry. Both appear to have been made in the US but it is hard to really know. Great snacks. Both come in reclosable bags. Good Sense gets my vote.
1,"These seeds are great and good for you too! I would prefer the product to have less salt but I limit the amount I have daily, so all is good!"
1,"These roasted little gems are a must have if you are on a low carbohydrate diet, or if you just want a snack that won't spike your blood sugar but still is nice and crunchy and satisfying.  I tried the salted version but I am tempted now to try some of their other flavors."
1,"These are better than the other brands I have tried. Most have an ingredients list along the lines of ""Pumpkin seeds, salt, (maybe some kind of oil)"" and that's it, and usually taste as bland as paper to me. I like salt, nay...I love salt. These have a nice roasted flavor, and salt you can actually taste. They are not overly salty tasting, you don't feel the salt on your fingers, and there isn't a layer of salt in the bottom of the bag like you see in a bag of pretzels. It was nice not to have to get out the salt shaker and dump some in the bag.<br /><br />I wound  up eating nearly a whole bag in one sitting. If you like nuts and seeds, and enjoy a tasty salty snack then you will most definetly like these."
1,"Okay, the doctor said, after the second heart attack that some changes could help. Caffeine was one area. But I did not want to give up my coffee, and it was always Starbucks (home brew), no store in our small town. I've been hooked on the strength and goodness of Sumatra for years. No restaurant in our area makes coffee as good as my wife makes my home brew Sumatra. So I give Decaf Sumatra from Starbucks a try.<br /><br />HONEST, NO LIE, I COULD NOT TELL THE DIFFERENCE. I even tried mixing half regular with half decaf. It always comes out tasting great and tasting like Starbucks Sumatra. There was a couple of days of headache that goes with caffeine withdraw, the reason for the 1/2 and 1/2 mix. But now, Decaf is as good as Regular. We keep the regular available for company, and I imbibe when that is made, but I never really know unless I see the bag and read the label. Honest!<br /><br />True, Starbucks costs a bit more. But you get what you pay for.<br />Stock up when you see a sale. I've had Starbucks in the freezer (we always use the whole bean and grind weekly) for over a year and it tasted fine. I've even bought outdated Starbucks, and it tasted better than the popular shelf brands, even past its sell-by date.<br /><br />No I don't work for Starbucks. They don't pay me for this ad. But they do make plenty of profit from my personal demand that I buy only Starbucks Sumatra--be it Regular or Decaf."
1,"The La Lechera item immediately preceding this on the page was priced at 4/$12.53. The Dulce de Leche, which is usually a few cents more expensive than the condensed milk was priced at $14.95.  I thought that was also for four, but when the order arrived there was ONLY ONE.  $15 for a $3.30 item (Walmart price) is outrageous.<br /><br />Returning it would cost over $6, so I guess my wife will enjoy a few gold plated sundaes and I will have to learn to read descriptions more carefully.  I feel that many Amazon Prime items are overpriced to recoup the cost of free shipping.<br /><br />The product is delicious, but a dollar an ounce is way out of line for a product that usually sells for under 25 cents per ounce.<br /><br />P.T. Barnum was, unfortunately, right."
1,"I love that this is a no-stir option without hydrogenated oils. I really hate stirring natural peanut butter. Plus, oily peanut butter - yuck! My only issue is that it's far too sweet. I got used to peanut butter without sugar. I also think the company is being a little deceptive. They say that there's ""no added sugar,"" but then admit in the description that there's cane juice. The carb count, for anyone who's interested, is 8 grams (3 grams of which are sugar) per 2 tablespoons. Whether it's cane juice or sugar or corn syrup, it's really all sugar. Because of the over-sweetening and higher carb count, I probably won't be ordering from this company again, but if they ever make a no-stir peanut butter without any kind of sugar, I'll be the first in line.<br /><br />Fortunately, I was able to turn the peanut butter into low-carb peanut butter cookies. The sweetness doesn't bother me as much in cookie form."
1,"I like all the flavors in the Peanut Butter Co. line. The Maple one is fantastic -- not one I thought I would like and it turned out to be my favorite. The smooth operator tastes like most other natural pb's - nothing out of the ordinary. The price is higher than some other brands. It's worth a try and definitely better than the non-natural brands, but don't expect too much difference from other natural brands. (There is some added oil and salt.)"
1,This is good peanut butter without additives. we eat lots of it and have just ordered our second 6 pack. I'd recommend it.
1,"I love this peanut butter, but suprise suprise, so do my kids!  I have always bought the large container of the jiffy/skippy brands from costco, but wanted to get away from the hydrongenated oils and excessive sugar.  I still wanted it to taste good, be smooth and not seperate like the high end organic food stores.  This is a great alternative, and I feel better feeding it to my kids."
1,"This has become by far our go to choice for peanut butter.  I was not sure what to expect when I placed the order but must say the taste is very good with a clear peanut taste all most like fresh store ground peanut butter, but sweeter, and no stirring."
1,"This has become my absolute favorite peanut butter.  Buying by the 6 pack and also with my Amazon Prime membership, it's a great bargain.  I just wish they made this in bigger jars.  My family eats a lot of peanut butter so 6 jars do not last us very long.  I like that this is all natural, and you don't have to stir it.  It's not that sweet tasting, so if you like a sweet peanut butter this might not be for you.  I think it has a really good taste and texture.  Their other flavor the PB and Dark Chocolate is amazing as well!"
1,"Cheaper than store brand in my area, and much better.  Bought on the word of a relative from the NY area...excellant choice to have made!"
1,"Very happy with the quality and value of this peanut butter.  I dont really like that there is sugar added, but at least its not corn syrup or trans fat."
1,"I love that this is a no-stir natural peanut butter. It has no trans fats and no cholesterol, no hydrogenated oil and no high fructose corn syrup. What I didn't expect was the extra sweetness provided by the evaporated cane juice and palm fruit oil. I prefer pure, ground peanuts. Nevertheless, I would purchase this again. I think children would probably prefer it over natural, oily p.b. too."
1,"We love this PB! its the best out there, and we order this online be cause it is often out of stock at our local grocery."
1,"I love, love this PB!! Its so smooth and taste so good don't even need jelly with it its so good!"
1,My husband and I love this peanut butter!  The taste is great and we love that they support cycling.
0,"I don't know about you, but when I go looking for a product that explicitly states it has no added sugar, I mean sugar in the general, anything-that-is-chemically-sugar sense.  These folks make the ""no added sugar"" claim, and then follow it up with (oh by the way) ""a little bit of cane juice for sweetness.""  Which is to say, added sugar.  3 grams per serving, in fact, if my online search for this product's nutritional information is correct.<br /><br />Who are these people, unemployed politicians?<br /><br />I'm sticking with the Fifty50 brand.  Not only are they not lying through their teeth about not adding sugar, but they also donate half their profits to Diabetes research."
1,"The place where I get most of my essential oils from has started to sell these Himalayan salt diffusers. They had little jars filled with olive size pink salt and you pour the oil over them, close the lid when not in use. I thought I could do that myself. I found these on Amazon, just what I was looking for. Perfect size and price.  The salt does not influence the fragrance of the oils at all, the perfect diffuser. I even will smash some with a hammer for my salt grinder. Spice Lab shipped it out quickly, very happy with the product and Spice Lab."
1,"The flavors in the chocolates are only outdone by their beauty. They a soo good! I know the chef, he trained in Switzerland to learn how to make these, and you can tell. They melt in your mouth and rival any ""name brand"" out there."
1,"I have loved chocolate my whole life and have sought out many types.  This chocolate is smooth, creamy and delicious.  It's hard to put the box down.  I am spoiled for other chcolates!! I highly recomend them to others."
1,"I have English Cocker Spaniels who are allergic to grain. These are GREAT! I have ordered them before and never seem to have enough. My dogs are VERY happy campers. Healthy ingredients and taste good too! They will obey any command I request when they know these treats are available. Wet tongues and wiggle bodies make my heartstrings sing!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002R13LA6"">Northern Biscuit Grain-Free Honey Glazed Duck w/ Real Papaya Dog Treat</a>"
1,"Grand Aroma Insalata is so wonderful I refuse to make a salad without it. I dribble a small amount on my salads, toss lightly and then add a favorite dressing - lightly, again. Using Insalata takes the bite out of overly-vinegary dressings and adds a tiny bit of lemon flavor to all dressings. I always order several and share a bottle or two with my daughter who sometimes uses it with a tad of balsamic vinegar - nothing else. I don't often review products, but Insalata is so spectacular I'm happy to do so for it.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DDBL4C"">Grand'aroma Insalata Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 8.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)</a>"
0,"Is this for 10LB Case of Jelly Belly Tutti Frutti Jelly Beans or is this for what the picture shows ""Baby Flash Pop""... Please change picture or description, very misleading... thank you."
1,"My wife and I used to eat these all the time back when I lived in Central Illinois. Strangely, when I moved to Chicagoland, we couldn't find them any more. So, I was thrilled to discover I could get them from Amazon.<br /><br />These are incredibly tasty. And, unlike many other brands, they are free of trans fats. My only criticism is that they're a bit more fragile than some other brands, especially after heating them in the over per the package directions. You have to be careful biting into them to prevent your entire taco from falling apart. If they were a bit more robust, I'd give them 5 stars.<br /><br />One thing to note: being preservative-free, they have a relatively short shelf life. The case I got from Amazon had a ""best by"" date about 3 months in the future. So, before ordering 12 boxes, make sure that you can go through at least a box per week."
1,"When you live in Kalamazoo it can be difficult to get taco shells without preservatives.Sounds weird I know. Even so I was delighted to see Little Bear Shells on Amazon. Unfortunately, there was a severe communication issue. My shells arrived -- 1 box of 12 shells. I called customer service and tried to explain that more than $20 for one box of taco shells was crazy and that clearly there were supposed to be 12 boxes of 12 shells each or 144 shells in my order. The rep did not understand. She was confused by my complaint, after all the site said 12 and I had received 12. We agreed to disagree. To her credit, she was very kind about refunding the money. I may order these shells again (they are yummy tasting) but I'll wait until they change the number in the package or the number of packages in the order."
1,"Bought these shells because i love the bearitos brand.  The first order came with a bunch of cracked shells, but amazon fixed that issue for me.  No complaints here."
1,"I picked up a package of blue corn taco shells locally but when I went back for more they were discontinued and I couldn't find them anywhere else.  I really think these are better than the yellow or white corn shells.  I mix shredded chicken with only a small can of chopped green chilis, stuff it into a shell with lettuce, tomato and cheese and they're wonderful."
1,Have tried this brand before and love it. These cookies are really good. Will try more from this brand. They know cookies.
1,"This was the best $18.00 I ever spent on a box.  I ate that box so fast I was dizzy.  I was skeptical about ordering a box online but there wasn't anything too fishy about this one so I just went to town on it.  I spilled some on the carpet but the dog came over to clean it up.  Whoah, Sparky! That's for me!"
1,"Wow, this actually tastes good.  Light tasting with a subtle berry flavor.  Each 16 ounce can has 30 calories and only 8 grams of carbs even though it has Organic Agave Syrup.  It does have Stevia but not enough to give it any off flavors.  A welcome change from the other energy drinks!"
1,Amara is so refreshing it has replaced my need for one to two cokes per day.  It is a win-win proposition......vastly fewer calories and no sugar.  Not to mention that the taste is so much better.  And I feel great!
1,"I must say I am not someone who usually writes reviews, but I am making an exception because I finally discovered the perfect healthy drink product on the market and trust me when I hear about a new beverage I am quick to try it, kinda like the inner researcher in me ;) .<br /><br />I am an avid food and beverage label reader and Amara's ingredients are legit. The drink isn't 'fake healthy' like a lot of other 'healthy' beverage companies. It is the perfect mixture of health in a can and it's low calorie (low cal's are important to me, since I don't like to drink my calories). I love how Amara is like ""water +"". I am someone who tries to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day and water can get boring, but I have found Amara to be my go-to as my water with a kick. I like that it is low in sugar, has a light zing of carbonation, and that I can drink multiple 16oz cans (can't do that with any liquid besides water) and it's never overwhelming nor boring. It truly is my water alternative and it is sure addicting.<br /><br />I will admit I was nervous to try Amara for a few reasons, one because it looked like an energy drink (I really dislike those). Two, because I am sensitive to caffeine, but I've never felt glittery or weird from the amount of caffeine in Amara (maybe because of the electrolytes it has and so I never feel dehydrated or off from it), and three because I am a runner and thought the carbonation would hurt my stomach, but surprisingly it never did and made me feel great during and after a workout! I even like to drink Amara in the morning on my way to work!"
1,I came across Amara a few weeks ago while shopping at a Whole Foods.  I was impressed by the taste and the uses and I started using it after my workouts and love the effects!  When you really need to rehydrate this is the way to go!  You feel it right away and it tastes great!
1,"Amara is a great product.  It tastes delicious, not fruity and is lo cal.  A perfect beverage after working out.  Red Bull and Monster are so heavy...like a weight in your stomach.  Amara is a refreshing recovery beverage.  Who wants to fill full after a workout?  Not me!"
1,I have never really liked the taste of redbull or monster (too weird and tangy) but Amara is delicious. It has great flavor with just enough kick to keep you moving.  I drink it solo and have also used it as a mixer - goes great with vodka.  Will definitely order more.
1,"This stuff is amazing! Seriously tastes great and way better than the sugary red bull, or even sugar free because it contains an all natural sugar and non of that funky fake stuff. After a night of drinking this really helps rejuvenate and give you some added energy as well. Its a clear liquid and not bright pink and has a light sweet taste but nothing over powering. I can't find it anywhere as I believe it is a new product. I am ordering multiple cans because its something you WANT on hand when you are feeling a little under the weather or just had too much to drink the night before and your forced to be productive the next day."
0,"A great disappointment.  Having read about the excellence of vintage Pernod products, I was eager to try their modern concoction.<br /><br />What a fall from Grace!  Not only the green color of the drink is obviously artificial; when louched, the potent green is still present, making the final product greenish instead of the white it should be.  You can only taste a strong anise flavor, and a burning sensation when you are finished.  No hint of wormwood at all!<br /><br />I would not recommend this absinthe even to beginners.  Don't waste your money on this one.<br /><br />P.S. I refuse to discuss thujone content and other non-sense and myths in my reviews.  If you are interested in thujone, go eat sage and forget absinthe altogether."
0,"Ok, so 24 16.9 oz bottles for $49.95. I pay $0.88 or $1.25 for my 2 liter bottle (depending on the promotions). Therefore, 24 x 16.9 oz bottles cost only around $11-$15."
1,"Initially ordered this at slightly over a dollar per can. These are big cans (22 oz) instead of the smaller ones, so that was a good deal. The dogs loved this (Chicken flavor) and the T-bone Steak flavor as well, so if they're happy and jumping around to gobble it down, that's good enough for me. I mix it in with dry crunchy food and they lick their bowls clean. I haven't tried it myself (just can't get hungry enough to eat dog food...)  but it smells good. I see the price has roughly doubled since the first order however, so I'm going to have to look elsewhere for a better price or find something else. No problem with the item itself, just the price, and even then, only because it was a good deal before."
1,"I have two senior dogs that were on a raw natural food diet for many years.  I had been hard pressed to find something that would fulfill my pets nutritional requirements while being comprised of healthy ingredients.  This is it!  Even my vet, a fierce advocate for raw food, approves of this.  My dogs love it, I no longer have to mix my own ingredients together, and I have peace of mind knowing my beloved pets are being fed high-quality food.  They devour every last particle!"
1,"This is one food that when mixed with their dry food, my dogs will eat every last drop. They love this. Our older dog (just turned 2) needs to be on a grain free diet, so that is what our puppy gets too. I love that this is 95% Turkey and that the dogs really like it."
1,"My parents were having issues getting their Yorkie to eat Wellness dry and so was I with my Yorkie. They would eventually eat, but it was dragging down their routines. According to the Whole Dog Journal, Wellness Canned Dog Food Chicken and Sweet Potato Recipe is a great food for your dog. The article stressed how gone are the days where wet food was worse for a dog than dry. As long as it's a good, quality food, the wet is actually better for dogs than the dry. I mix the wet with the dry and our Yorkies lap it down quick. I can also hide my Yorkie's morning pill with it and she doesn't realize she's taking her medicine."
1,"I have been involved in dog rescue for many years. I recently took in a very large hound who had been starved within an inch of his life. The vet recommended this (in addition to many other treatments and holistic measures, including yogurt!) to try to quickly get some weight on and good nutrition into the dog. You'd think a starving dog would eat anything, but often times they will not. I had to bake this hound homemade meatloaf for a month. Wellness and Nutro canned were the only ""dog foods"" I could get him to eat. But he did gain weight steadily, was able to wean off 'human food', and did very well.  After gaining 20 lbs, he was adopted by a wonderful family. When you need the best, any of the Wellness Brands I would highly recommend."
1,"Had my big noble boy dog, who had been with me for ten years, die of Cancer recently. He was a animal shelter rescue (As all my pets have been, and are.), and a great creature who never wanted to ever show weakness. By the time he did show weakness, the Cancer was far too advanced to operate on or save him and he died within a month.<br /><br />That set me to feeding my two dogs (His mate who is still with me, and her new mate) ONLY quality dog food. It costs more; but after seeing what was in the average store dog food on internet posts, and confirmed on dog food cans labels, that convinced me to try something better.<br /><br />I researched the net for the top ten dog foods, and this brand kept coming up in the lists consistently; including Veterinary sites. Made only with grain free quality ingredients,and otehr healthy additions for good digestion, my two dogs eat it enthusiastically, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Both dogs are fed Wellness brand ""Beef Stew"" and Wellness brand ""Lamb and Beef Stew"", alternating for variety in their diets; they love both equally, and both canned foods are equally healthy."
1,"I have had my chihuahua since he was a puppy, and he never had much of an appetite. I tried all varieties of dry and canned dog food and he would barely sniff them. He was underweight as a result and his coat looked terrible. I was so glad to discover this dog food. It is the only thing he will eat! Since I began feeding him lamb he has gained a whole pound and his coat is thicker and longer. He also eats the Wellness dry. I really cannot say enough good things about this brand of dog food. It also works for my other chihuahua who has a huge appetite but severe food allergies.<br /><br />If nothing else has worked, give this a try! You may be surprised by how much your dog loves it."
1,My 13 yr old min pin suddenly stopped eating her regular brand food.She went many days not eating  so i switched to this brand and she went BESERK FOR IT.I now buy it from Amazon because it's a little cheaper and i don't have to hassle running back and forth to the pet store wasting my gas and paying more.This is a highly rated pet food without the BY-PRODUCTS store bought dog food has.My little girl seems to be more active since i've been feeding her this brand and I feel better knowing she is getting better nutrition.....
1,"My pups LOVE this food!  WELLNESS products have consistently proven to be top of the line food for dogs and cats and their Chicken Stew is no exception!<br />This is so well made and although the sauce is kinda slimy, it is a healthy slimy and one that nourishes my dearest of creatures!  Please note that this food is not meant as a dish all unto itself, but rather, it is a food topper to go with dry food nuggets.  Together the nutrition abounds!"
1,My dog is now older so she is not happy having to take so many pills. I switched from the more solid Wellness (which is still pretty good) to the stew line since thanks to the thick gravy I no longer have to use most of the can to hide medication. I agree with some of the reviews that my dogs stools were a little on the runny side but figuring out that it was due to whitefish and not of the food itself I just stopped buying the ones with whitefish listed and she has yet to have the same side effect. So take that into account with your pet it could be something listed that was not apart of your dog food before.
1,I like the fact that Wellness offers grain free all meat canned and limited ingredient allergy dry food. Unfortunately my old dog has serious skin issues that Wellness also did not seem to correct so I have decided to take him off commercial foods completely and he now eats only organic human grade freeze dried artisan dog food. Wellness dog food is probably one of the better choices if you feed your dog commercial foods so I recommend this product over other cheaper commercial brand names. Amazon prices are the best and shipping to Maui excellent.
1,"The ratings for this food are among the highest and my Labrador LOVES this stuff!  I feel very good giving him this high quality food and am glad that my picky eater wants something that is so good for him.  It's chunky and you can see peas, carrots, potato, and, of course, the chunks of meat.  I highly recommend this product!"
0,I thought I would try this stuff for my finicky dog who needs moist food along with his kibble.  He was not a big fan of it and it was the most expensive moist food at Petsmart.  The other problem is this stuff hardens up like concrete in his bowl. If he wouldn't eat the food in about two hours the stuff turned as hard as a sidewalk and I had to literally scrape it out of his bowl.
1,WE FOUND THIS DOG FOOD ONLINE AND COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT IT WAS 95% BEEF WITH NO FILLERS! THIS IS HARD TO BEAT FOR PET FOOD. OUR GUYS LOVE THIS FOOD AND IT IS NICE TO KNOW IT ISN'T FILLED WITH JUNK. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FOOD.
1,"Food mixes well, ingrediants are healthy, dog loves the taste.  What more could you ask for!"
1,I just got my 1yr old shihtzu the turkey and she loves it. I mix it with her dry food. It does have a gel substance around the food. I just mix the entire can up gel and all and put it in a small tupperware container. I put left overs in the fridge. My extremely picky girl had her nose in the can while I was trying to scoop the food out. She licked her bowl clean. So happy I found this stuff. Also it actually smells good. I didn't think it smelled at all. My girl is allergic to chicken so I was very happy to find wellness made several flavors without any chicken and grain free. Highly recommend this dog food.
1,"This item came very fast! And my French Bulldog ate this stuff even faster!Great product, great price, fast shipping. I recommend this to all dog lovers for a healthy dog treat!"
1,"It is a good dog food.  Our dogs stools have become normal since using it.  My only complaint is when you open the can there is a gell similar to when you open a can of Spam, which has to be scraped off and you lose some dog food because of the space taken by the gel."
1,One of my dogs is an extremely picky eater so when I find a food he will eat without a problem I can safely recommend it to everyone.

1,"I've been feeding Wellness food to my Chihuahua for nearly a year and she loves it. She dances around eager for her breakfast when I start scooping it into her dish. I would give it 5 stars, except that it is difficult to find in the 6 oz size, and it has that room-filling reek that most canned dog foods have (which my dog loves, but I hate). She has not had any digestive issues with the food, and I like that the first three ingredients on the list are all turkey, and the following three are vegetables. I can actually see the sweet potato in the food. My dog doesn't have any food allergies, but I have read that foods using alternative meats such as turkey, lamb and duck can help if your dog has poor reaction to beef based foods. As long as they keep making this, I'll keep buying it."
1,"I love this brand. If you go to their website, sign up for their newsletters. They'll send you $3.00 off coupons every couple of months or so. No so helpful when purchasing through amazon but helpful if you have a local store with Amazon similar pricing like I do ;)<br /><br />My dog loves this food. I use a spoonful in his dry food every night with some warm water to make it a little soupy for him. I like the ingredients, the way his coat looks, how he NEVER has bad breath or dog farts. Ever."
1,I mix a spoonful of the Wellness food topper/mixer with Wellness Core dry food for both of my dogs and they LOVE it! It's healthy AND grain free which makes me feel confident that they are getting everything they need in their diets. Both dogs eat every bit of their food at their scheduled feedings which has been super beneficial for potty training my new rescue dog. I would highly recommend Wellness to everyone! You can't go wrong with this stuff!
1,"With one dog who'll eat anything and another who's quite finicky it was good to find something they both liked.  Not a ""stand alone"" food, it's meant to be mixed with kibble for a complete diet.  My fussy boy loves it...and he doesn't love much!"
1,"After reviewing the lamb product that is labeled the same way it is worth noting that this food is very good as well.  Not quite as attractive as the lamb, but still rated high on her taste test scale.  It provides a way to give some variety without upsetting her system.  Most of the Wellness canned foods are remarkable in that respect."
1,"I am the companion to a small dog of unknown age and breed who has been troubled with a tender tummy for a few years.  Her vet has tons of medications to give her, but I don't need any of them since I tried the Wellness brand dry dog food and the moist.<br /><br />All her problems gave gone away.  It is amazing.  She has not been to the vet since her last yearly checkup."
1,"My dog is very picky but she will eat this, and it is so good for her.<br />I will definitely keep buying this."
1,"I have the pickiest eater in the world! He loves it.<br />Gilbert (cockapoo), also had stomach issues. I'm glad to report after a week on Wellness Lamb and Sweet Potato, in addition to the Core dry food, Gil's stomach problems are over.<br /><br /> This is Human Grade Food for dogs.  He gets one 6 ounce can a day and munches on core dry all day. I also cut out all processed dog treats. We stick with fresh food treats such as: apple, sweet potato, egg, and some cheese once in awhile. Frozen string beans in an ice cube tray are also great!<br /><br />Please take care to feed your dogs and cats natural foods!  Read articles on rendered meats, your stomach will turn.  Take care!"
1,"We have been feeding our 3 year old fussy Italian Greyhound this for about 2 years now and it's one of the few canned dog foods he likes. It think it's the sweet potato. Hopefully, it's healthy for hims as well."
1,My dogs like this so much that they bark while I'm dishing it up!  They have liked all of the Wellness Stew brands that they have tried.  It smells and looks good too.
1,My dogs and I love this food. They never leave a trace and I am happy that it is healthy for them. I mix it up with the Wellness Super 5 mix.
1,"My dog loves this....and so do we!  Miki has been having problems for over a year with the skin just outside of her tear ducts getting red, then raw...poor thing.  Each time I'd take her to the vet, (2 different vets just to see), they  both prescribed the same eye drop medicine ($27.00) for a tiny bottle.  But, it never cleared up entirely, and the minute I'd stop with the drops, after weeks of applying 2-3 x's a day, it would come right back. Looking at her made me feel terrible.<br /><br />Then, I started thinking about maybe it was something she is eating, even though I've been feeding her Ceasar for a couple years and thought it to be a ""good"" dog food.  But after researching what was in Wellness dog food compared to the store bought stuff, I couldn't believe I was feeding her that stuff!<br />So, after doing the math, a 3oz tub of Ceasar vs the 12 1/2 oz can of Wellness, I could get 3 bigger servings (4.1 oz each) out of a can of Wellness...for the same, or better price, and it was way healthier for her!<br /><br />Our Miki looks so pretty again (Papillon) and seems she has a whole lot more energy too! I figure it must be the change in diet that helped clear up her eyes but wasn't sure because we moved at the same time (same town) and I thought it might have been some plants/allergies she was getting into in the back yard.  But....I let myself run out of Wellness (not on purpose!) and had to feed her something else, so I went with the Ceasar and ordered her some more Wellness.  By the time I placed and received my order, (not much more than a week), the skin below her eyes had already broken out again! Ummmm...CONFIRMATION! And guess what?  Within 2 weeks after our Wellness shipment arrived, and she was back eating her favorite dog food, Miki's tear duct area was dried up, rawness gone, and hair was growing back!<br /><br />I don't even remember how I stumbled across this dog food, and who would have ever thought I'd be ordering dog food from Amazon, but with the great price, and free super saver shipping, like I said earlier, it's the same price as that store bought ""stuff"", but she gets more than an ounce more per serving and look at the ingredients...it's real chicken, and sweet potatoes! (A lot of other good for her stuff!)<br /><br />I'm sold on Wellness (so is Miki~she loves it!) I had just come back online to re-order some more Wellness Chicken and Sweet Potato food, when I thought that I should take a moment to RAVE about this great stuff.<br />So I did!"
1,"well I gave this product 4 stars because the purpose I used it for was not intended.  I saw that it had 95%  meat which was perfect (in my mind) for a cat diet, and the price point was nearly half of that which is for cats.<br /><br />FTR:  Cats and dogs have two completely and vastly varied nutritional needs, in my research I recall reading that a cat's diet is mainly 95% meat (from which they derive their moisture/water from as well) since cats hunt and eat small rodents and birds in nature this makes sense, since the 5% veggie content is likely from eating cat grasses and the contents of their prey's tummy at the time of death.<br /><br />I decided to purchase this food since it was only 2.56 a can at Unleashed and I figured I would just add in a calcium supplement, and taurine, and cat vitamin supplement to make up for the missing bones which would provide the natural calcium source for cats, and taurine since I don't believe dogs require as much taurine in their diets as cats would and vitamins to make up for the possibility that there may not be enough vitamins in just meat alone.<br /><br />My cats loved it.  I have one very finicky girl kitty whom refuses to eat human foods (which is a good thing)  and most junky cat foods (another good thing)  and one male cat that eats whatever he can get his whiskers into.  They both liked this.  So I would consider feeding this to them in lieu of the more expensive cat foods (after I compare the ingredients of this to that of cat foods and make up the missing vitamins and minerals)  however I am not happy with the fact that this cat food has the consistency of pate..<br /><br />it is all ground up meats and looks like refried beans... I'm going to search for a similar product which has shredded meat rather than this consistency :)"
1,I have to say its a bit pricey but at the end I actually saved alot because you only need to give a couple of spoonful along with the dry food. My dog loves it! You have to make sure you give a small amount depending on the size of your pet because it's high in calories. Sashie did not experience any problems when I switched to this new dog food. It's also a great coverup for any medications your dog might need to take.
1,"My geriatric dog has been an extremely fussy eater ever since I brought her home at 14 weeks.  I recently tried Wellness kibble and wet foods and she likes them all, but she particularly LOVES the 95-Percent canned toppers and WOLFS her kibble down with this product mixed in.  Wish I had tried Wellness foods before but better late than never."
1,"I typically make my own dogfood but when I'm short on time, I cook the veggies & use this canned chicken. My dogs love it!"
1,"This 12-pack case is a great value and is actually about 20 cents cheaper per can than my local pet food store. It arrived very quickly at our house and only one of the cans had a small dent at the base. It still made the swoosh sound when I opened it with the can opener, so the vacuum was still good and the food was still fresh. Great deal, and now I don't have to run out to the pet food store after work every few days to pick up more cans. I can simply drive home to my baby puppy at the end of the day. I did notice that all my dogs have had softer stools with this food, but if I mix it with the dry food and feed less frequently they don't have too much of a problem."
1,My 35 pound lab/terrier mix loves this food. I used it as a mix-in with her kibble. Everything arrived from the vendor in tip top shape. Will order again.
1,I have been feeding this to my 1 year old maltese and 4 month old chihuahua. I mix this in with their dry food and they both enjoy it a lot. It's a great deal buying from amazon compared to buying it at a pet store.<br /><br />The only down side is this food does dry up after leaving it out for 5-10 minutes.
1,"My wife and I bought a couple cans of this food for a few days when we were away from home with our dog. It is a little pricey, but then again this is definitely not meant as a daily meal - it even plainly says on the can to feed supplementally only!<br /><br />PROS<br />- Our dog loves it!<br />- 95% chicken content, no fillers<br />- Perfect for road/camping trips<br />- No gastrointestinal discomfort that we could see<br /><br />CONS<br />- Not human grade meat<br /><br />It is important to understand the difference between quality in meats for dog (and cat) food. Much research has been done on the subject (easily found on Google), but my wife and I decided some months ago to only feed our dog human-grade meat, termed in the pet food industry as ""inspected for human consumption"". The chicken used in the wellness food is NOT inspected for human consumption, however since we have only fed our pup this twice, we aren't too worried. If Wellness switched to human-grade meat, I would happily give this the full five stars, and this is really the only criticism I could give for this product.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I would recommend this as an occasional food for your dog, with the one reservation noted above."
1,"As a newly adopter of a one year old, I tried certain foods with not much success.  My dog loves this food, and I do too, as she eats well and healthy."
1,"I'm so happy to have found a high quality wet food for my miniature dachshund. Our family really believes that high quality food is important for a long and healthy life; we try to avoid all fillers and by-products. Our dog loves this formula, which we use one spoon of along with his dry food at each meal.<br /><br />For his size and diet I find that the small cans are more convenient since they last him so long."
1,This is a great product for my dogs. They love it and it is grain free for their allergy sensitivities.
1,"My two dogs love Wellness brand dog food.  It's expensive but I just feel I'm doing the right thing for them with food I think is probably good really meaty food. They have begin to turn away from Newmans and I sure don't trust Alpo since the Chinese dogfood scare, but the various Wellness products are the best I can do for my little (and quite big) best friends."
1,"WE ENJOY FEEDING OUR DOGS THIS GREAT FOOD AND IT IS NICE TO KNOW THAT IT ISN'T FILLED WITH FILLERS OR BY-PRODUCTS, WHATEVER THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE!I KNOW WE DON'T THINK BY-PRODUCTS ARE SOMETHING THAT BELONGS IN OUR PETS FOOD.I BELIEVE BY-PRODCTS ARE SOMETHING LEFT OVER AFTER EVERYTHING ELSE HAS BEEN PROCESSED! I LIKE THE IDEA THAT WE ARE FEEDING OUR ANIMALS FOOD GRADE MEALS THAT ARE GOOD FOR THEM. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT"
1,I have been buying this food locally but began to have a hard time fInding it. I searched online and it was a little more cost effective. My pups seem to love this food.
1,"this food is great but I suggest you just buy one can first, too make sure your dog likes it. (because it is expensive, but... your dog is worth it"
1,"It seemed like our dogs were getting tired of the same old thing for dinner, so I did some research and found this Wellness brand dog food. What I liked about it was the lack of by-products and cereals. Our dogs love the taste of this food and there is never any left in their bowls. It is a well baqlanced food that good for them also and having it shipped directly to my door saves us a trip to the pet stores. I count on Amazon for the best products."
1,"This is, by far, the favorite of my dogs canned food(one of the more expensive, of course).  If I want to be sure she is eating, I just put this down.  She has never failed to clean her bowl when it contains the lamb.  Her digestive system seems to handle it quite well for canned food.  My only complaint is the cost, but she is worth it."
1,My 4 yr old poodle loves this mixture. The combination of chunks and gravy are very exciting to him. Something to chew rather than swallow.
1,"After researching dog foods, I went with Wellness core and my little dog loves it!! I feed Wellness core and put 1/2 can of the canned in with it and am so pleased that my dog begs for ""mealtime""."
1,"I just wanted to supplement the dry food that I feed my two schnauzers. I tried several other brands and even other canned food by this same brand. My dogs did not do well on any of them until I tried this one. They love it and it does not cause stomach upset or potty problems. I highly recommend this product for extra protein, esspecialy if your dog has a delicate system."
1,My two dogs love this; they bark while I'm getting it ready and then woof it down! It looks good and smells good too.
1,"This is definitely a great product since all the ingredients are quality stuff. However, like some reviewers have stated or I read from the label about how some dogs can't take the 95% meat contend. My dog is one of them. She would have diarrhea if I mixed too much of this food with her dry food.  She LOVES this.  I have to mix VERY little into her dry food so she won't have any stomach problem. I would recommend this product; just add a little to the dry food to avoid any problems."
1,My dogs and I love this food. They never leave a trace and I am happy that it is healthy for them. I mix it up with the Wellness Super 5 mix.
1,"Since putting our dog on the Wellness dog food, we don't have any more diarrhea or upset tummy issues."
1,"My puppy had a severe diarrhea for weeks until we put her on Wellness Lamb and Sweet Potato.  Just like a miracle, she is healthy and energetic."
1,"This dog food is excellent! My Shih Tzu's are thriving on it, they are healthier and full of energy, no allergy problems that plaqued them in the past. Yes it is a little more expensive, but well worth it for the health of your pups! I highly recommend it!"
1,"My Heidi is a Bichon with allergies and her doctor told me to keep her on Duck and Potato food as these were the least likely to cause an allergic reaction.  I, of course, wanted the best for my Heidi and Wellness is the best."
1,"I mix this soft food with my Boston Terrier's dry food, so I don't use much for each meal. Using the larger cans meant I would end up throwing half a can away.<br /><br />Wellness brand is very high quality food, and has been working very well for our dog who has a very sensitive stomach."
1,"Even though this is 95% chicken, it looks like cat food (ground up texture) and smells like stinky canned chicken.  It's a very strong smell!  My dogs go NUTS for this, though (1 Labrador and 2 Boston Terriers).  I just add a couple spoonfuls as a topper to their dry food, so one can lasts awhile.  I probably will try something less smelly next time but I like the quality of the ingredients and like the Wellness brand."
1,"I was able to add a full pound to my skinny, 15yr old toy poodle with this.  He loves it and looks forward to dinner again.  I'd order it through Amazon, but it's only one cent cheaper on Amazon than it is in the pet store."
1,"Product was priced fairly; delivery was fast and affordable.  If you have ever had Heinz India Relish, this is exactly like it, which is different than most other pickle relishes--I think it is made with sweet pickles and bread-and-butter pickles.  Mix this relish with fresh or canned corn and a little onion and bell pepper, and you have the perfect Corn Relish for a summer side-dish.  Delicious."
1,"The bamboos arrived in a healthy state and are growing very well. The packaging was very good and the roots were protected from getting dry. Although the plants were on the way for more than 5 days, they didn't have any problems."
1,"I have a 12 1/2 year old Golden Retriever who has worn her teeth almost completely down.  The Barkster treats are very crunchy and yet very easy for her to chew as they break apart easily.  Also, due to less activity due to her arthritis, the Barksters are low in calories which is a big help.  I really am pleased to have found them available on Amazon.  Thank you."
1,safe and tasty treat.i would assume these are like puffed cheetos for dogs. popeye loves them and i get a kick out of hearing him actually crunch and chew instead of woofing down his treats whole and risk getting choked...plus i think these melt in his mouth if the peices are too small for him to crunch.
1,"I love these healthy dog treats. My dog has trouble with a lot of processed dog foods and treats. These are a great way to give her a little something extra when she's a good girl and not have to worry if she will get sick or have an allergic reaction. I will warn you, though, they often arrive broken in pieces, even though they are packed fairly well. They are very delicate, crispy treats. I usually break them down into pieces anyway, so it isn't much of a drawback for me, but it may bother some of you."
1,"Ok, let's be honest. ""Dogs will be dogs"" and mine love just about anything edible,  but they go absolutely bonkers for these little crisps.  I feel good about giving them these as snacks or for training, for a few reasons.<br /><br />First, just like the box says they're ""guilt-free""; made with brown rice and beef, they're wheat & gluten free, low fat and only 12 calories per treat -- so I feel good about not giving them ""junk food"", per se.<br /><br />Second, they're light & crispy -- like a puffed rice, so the pups aren't being weighed down by a heavy dog biscuit full of corn & sugar.  Lastly, the dogs REALLY like/crave these, so they've been a great tool for training, when I use the crisps as a positive reinforcement for good behavior.  When I'm doing repetitive action training over & over again (like teaching my one dog how to shake), I'd rather give him 10 of these than 10 pieces of hot dog or chemical-laden mushy dog snacks.  These brown rice & beef Barksters accomplish both of our needs and I'm actually rewarding him with something good for his body and his spirit."
1,"My Maggie L-I-V-E-S for Her Treatie Time<br /><br />Every evening, after the dogs have eaten and played outside until bedtime, it turns into ""Treatie-Time."" Both of my girls, Lucille and Maggie, are allowed two treats, or sometimes three each if they really beg. They have to sit or down or do something special to ""earn"" their treatie, but it's a special time for us.<br /><br />I value my dog's health, as I'm sure you do. I want them to live a long time and have a trouble-free existence - no scratchy skin allergies, etc. Therefore, I've explored using organic treats, and have even purchased some expensive ones from a local dog bakery. I must tell you that the ""girls"" were underwhelmed with those treats. Despite their healthy ingredients.<br /><br />Therefore, when I was approached to review the new brand of organic treats for Barksters, I was ambivalent. Organic treats haven't been very well received in my household in the past, but I was game to try them again.<br /><br />I believe in organic treats, but if the girls don't eat them, it's really money down the drain. Especially since we're not depending upon the treats for total nutrition, I'm also concerned with treats being of the the low-calorie variety. I was horrified to learn that one of the standard biscuit-y treats contained over 500 calories in each one. That's terrible.<br /><br />As I opened the two packages of Barksters, one was Sweet Potato and Chicken Krisps and the other was Brown Rice and Beef Krisps, I was glad to see two things on the packaging:<br /><br />1.The treats are made in the good ole' U.S. of America. This is important, especially because of the recent pet deaths from pet food manufactured in China.<br /><br />2.The treats are wheat free and gluten free.<br /><br />The second is most important for my ""grand-dog"" Dutchy, the Siberian Husky. Ever since he's been a pup he's struggled with digestive issues. Our vet recommended that he have a gluten-free diet, which has helped him tremendously. We don't want to ruin his digestion with treats.<br /><br />As we spent the afternoon on the deck on a steamy Georgia Sunday afternoon, I broke out the two types of treats to see what the doggy reactions would be. I was surprised to see that the treats reminded me of rice cakes - very puffy - and wafer-like, instead of a biscuit. And, I must say that they were both a great hit with all the dogs. They couldn't get enough of them.<br /><br />The wafers tended to break, but that allowed me to give smaller treats more often to the group. They didn't mind if it was broken in two, that just meant two treats - Bonus!<br /><br />The treats cost approximately $10 per box which contained 5 ounces, which seems pricey. But, since it's a ""luxury"" item, I can go with the price. I was pleasantly surprised at how much the dogs liked these treats, especially since they didn't look like the ones they're used to getting for their ""treatie-time.""<br /><br />I'd highly recommend that you try Barksters!"
1,"Our dogs love Barksters (all varieties), so when my friend needed to potty train her new rescue dog I recommended them to her.  They worked like a charm!  Since they only have 12 calories and can be broken into smaller bits, she could give a piece every time the dog went out.  It's hard to describe their texture.  They are puffed and crispy, but not fried.  They are crinkly like a potato chip but much thicker.  The best part is that they are all natural...oh, and made in America!"
0,"I ordered this company's French Roast and it was awesome. The mesh cups are great, the flavor bold and rich. I should have stuck with the French Roast.  I was sadly dissapointed in Fogchaser. It was actually bland, nothing bold about it.  Either there was something wrong with the coffee or it is just plain weak.  I will reorder the French Roast and give the other 46 cups of Fogchaser to my 87 year old Father-in-law who likes his coffee mild."
1,"On one hand, the unique unsealed design means you won't be keeping these in your K-cup holders or carousels.<br /><br />If you don't mind keeping these in a ziplock bag separate from your other cups and you don't mind the extremely strong scent when you open the bag, you will be treated to a bold flavor that is similar to Coffee People's Black Tiger but smoother.<br /><br />On the other hand, keeping them separate from your other cups allows you to hide them from your friends who like to use your fancy coffee maker."
1,"As a Bed & Breakfast owner and a serious online bargain-shopper, I happened upon this product while searching for the best price on K-Cups.  Needless to say, I serve a LOT of coffee!  Unique in appearance, the San Francisco Bay Coffee Fog Chaser K-Cups deliver a great cup of coffee!  As other reviews state, you'll notice a heavenly, strong coffee aroma when opening the air-tight plastic packaging.  Once opened, I store my Fog Chaser K-Cups in an empty, (clean) large metal coffee can.  It not only keeps the aroma intact, it keeps the K-Cups nice and fresh for brewing.<br /><br />If you haven't already tried these K-Cups, do!  I think you'll be impressed - and pleased that you don't have to pay top-dollar for a quality product!"
1,"I LOVE STRONG COFFEE AND ALMOST ALLWAYS USED ""NEWMANS OWN"" BUT I DECIDED TO TRY THESE BASED ON THE REVIEWS AND THE GREAT PRICE. WHAT A GREAT MOVE THIS TURNED OUT TO BE INCREDABLE COFFEE ,SMOOTH ,GREAT PRICE ,AND LESS PLASTIC. SO GOOD THAT I STARTED A SUBSCRIPTION,CHANGED TO INCREASE THE QUANTIY,AND NOW HAD TO ORDER A EXTRA SHIPMENT."
1,Loved the design of these. They fit perfectly in the Keurig brewer. Less plastic and great taste. Have not had any mishaps and no coffee grounds as you can sometimes get with regular Kcups.
1,"I was very pleasantly surprised by how good this coffee is. I have ordered several of their flavors on Subscribe and Save. Can't beat the price and they are all very good tasting coffee.<br />The pods are different but it is not an issue for me. I don't store them in my carrousel as I am afraid they would get ""stale"" but instead store them in a ziplock bag in the cabinet. This works great.<br />I like them all and wish San Fransisco Bay would come out with more flavors."
1,"The size and shape worried me.  I am glad that I read other reviews first.  The top of these cups are not as big around (diameter) as a regular k-cup.  In fact I was afraid that it wouldn't fit.  But they do.  Then they lack all the plastic that surrounds a normal k-cup on the bottom.  So they definitely look different and weird.  But taste is what is important.  Well taste and price.<br /><br />Taste- I have only tasted Fog Chaser.  It definitely has an upfront bitterness (or acidity) to it.  It is the first thing I notice.  Don't get me wrong.  I actually enjoy some acidity to my cup of coffee.  Otherwise I find it to be a bit bland.  After the acidity comes a great taste.  Very rich and strong.  In fact I think this is the strongest, boldest k-cup I have had.  Only real concern here is the packaging allows the coffee to go stale faster than if each was sealed individually.  It is nice that they come in three separate sealed bags.  But I think we will go through them fast enough that it would not be a problem.  If you drink very slowly and allow these to linger for several weeks I think the taste will definitely be an issue.<br /><br />Price- At 49 cents per cup this is unbeatable.  Then you have the option of buying on subscription and get them at 41 cents per.<br /><br />Conclusion= I love rich/strong coffee and I love the price.  sold."
1,This coffee is very good and affordable.  The flavor is medium without being watered down like a lot of K-Cups.
1,"I really like this coffee.  Rich, flavorful, bold, and very tasty.<br /><br />I was put off by the odd look of the cup at first...as many others have described, it looks strange when you first see it.  If you turn it upside down it looks like a cranium in a hair net.  But it's just as easy to use as a typical k-cup, so no problem there.  The only problem you might have is trying to place it in one of those vertical k-cup dispensers you can get wherever you buy k-cups.  This cup doesn't sit well in there.<br /><br />One thing you'll notice when you open the cardboard box and cut open the rather thick plastic pouch the 12 containers come in: the smell.  It's extremely rich, a very deep, bold smell that makes you think of your very best cup of coffee ever.  Think about it, though: that's the smell of your coffee when it's manufactured and placed within the container.  I doubt the plastic k-cups are as bold when they're tapped into by the Keurig machine...I'm sure they've disseminated some of the freshness on their way to you.<br /><br />What I do to keep that flavor is to take each cup out of the nice thick bag and immediately re-seal the bag with a strong clip.  I feel that retains the flavor.  In that sense, I'm glad they don't fit on the vertical k-cup dispensers...I like that the freshness stays intact within the thick plastic bag.<br /><br />Anyway, I love this flavor.  Keep it secure in the plastic pouch and you'll have a great fresh taste every time you want a cup."
1,"My girlfriend and I got a Keurig a couple years ago. Previously, donut shop or caribou kcups were our favorite. Those are both great, we still love them. I ordered the sfbay french roast, as was definitely intrigued. It had a bold taste, and the cups themselves got my attention. I wish the top cap wasn't plastic, but the pouch definitely allows for more of that coffee smell that I missed when moving to the keurig. I decided to try fog chaser out, it's fantastic. The flavor is wonderful, smells great while you're brewing, and we cut the tops off and easily compost the rest. It's a step in the right direction, and I would recommend these to anyone with a keurig."
1,"We were alittle hesitant at first, but love them! Everyone we have offered a cup to are also in love... will continue to purchase as long as the price remains almost unbeatable."
1,I love a really rich dark coffee. I thought I would give the fog chaser a try. The price was nice and I liked the idea of alot less plastic. I could tell when I opened the box that I was going to love the taste! Nice strong coffee!! Brought some to work with me and one of the Doctors I work with is going to order some. Will be ordering more myself.
1,"I love supporting family businesses and was pleasantly surprised to discover the Fog Chaser K-cups provide an excellent cup of coffee. I love my Keurig, and I also love a good cup of coffee in the morning and the San Francisco Bay Coffee Company doesn't disappoint. Their coffee is just as flavorful, if not more, than the big brand coffee chains. I will definitely be buying more Fog Chaser and also trying some of their other coffees!"
1,"I was a little wary of trying these, but the price was right, so what the heck?  The good news is, they're delicious.  Both the hubby and I are enjoying them.  I wish I could put them in my K-Cup carousel, but I guess I can live without that little perk in exchange for a more affordable K-cup that still tastes great.  I don't understand why people complaining about them going stale don't put them in a ziploc bag after opening.  We consume at least four cups of coffee per day in our house, so we go through one bag of 12 in 3 days or less.  That's not enough time for the coffee to go stale inside a zip loc bag!  Give these a try.  I am going to be sampling the other blends, for sure."
1,Much less plastic for the environment - way to go.. finally.. just imagine all the plastic cups from everones coffee floating around. I will report back once tasted... the reviews look great. Im game.
1,"This Fog Chaser was available at my local grocery store. I thought I would give it a try. Well let me tell you, even on the highest setting this cup is STRONG. Reminds me of a regular pot of Dark Communittee Coffee. If you think the regular k-cups are just too weak, give this a try and you won't be disappointed."
1,"These don't look like K-Cups but they work perfectly in your Keurig Coffee Maker.<br />I have to say that hands down this is the best coffee I've made in my Keurig in the Year that I've had it.  I like a lot of the different Brews but this is really Rich in Flavor with a nice Body! Haven't experienced that with any of the K-Cups up to this point.  I'm glad I signed up for Auto Delivery for these, and I'll look forward to my Monthly stipend!"
1,"Coffee preference is just a matter of taste, so my opinion regarding taste probably doesn't mean much. You'd have to try this coffee for yourself. What I can tell you is that these soft bottom cups are certainly different from the usual all-plastic k-cups. I was initially concerned about how well they would work in my Keurig, but after making about fifty or more brews, they work perfectly. No loose grinds left behind in the pod well, my mug or anywhere else. They cost a little less than k-cups so that's a nice plus for me. The minor drawback is that they come to you in plastic bags that once opened, allow exposure of the pods to air. Simple fix. I just put the remaining pods in a ziplock bag.<br />I like the taste of this French Roast coffee and the fact that it's also cheaper than the competition. Hopefully when the patent on k-cups expires this September we'll see more vendors offering better prices. This is probably why Keurig recently came out with a new brewer, ""the VUE""  that uses different and patented cups."
1,My favorite brand of coffee at a killer price delivered. Doesn't get any better than that! Love my Kuerig machine and this coffee!
1,"I always try my coffee straight black with no cream or sugar the first time. I did not care much for it in that form. Once I put creamer and sugar in though, it is a really good cuppa joe. I probably won't be ordering again since I don't always have cream/sugar available, but I think it is still a solid 4 star since it is so good when properly doctored up."
1,"We love this coffee!  Its delicious and bold, just like we like our coffee.  Its great to be able to get this quality of coffee at such a great price too!"
1,I had basically given up on my Keurig.  Couldn't make a good/strong cup of coffee no matter what brand of coffee I bought.  The Fog Chaser finally did it.  Changed my shipments from bi-monthly to monthly after the first cup.
1,Great coffee for someone who likes a stronger flavor. Small package that really packs a punch - I've had more expensive coffees and really prefer this one!
1,awesome coffee at an affordable price. delivered to my door at no cost to me.  makes having a keirig brewer even better.
1,This flavor is my favorite so far. The price isn't bad either.I would recommend this to anybody who is looking for a smooth cup of coffee.
1,"Tried it, loved it.  I like a bold blend and this one is great.  I really liked the new packaging, which works great in my Cuisinart Keurig machine.  It came in a box of 36, 3 sealed plastic bags of 12 each.  Stays very fresh in the sealed bags.  I put the open bag in the fridge to keep the coffee fresh (not sure I really have to bother doing that, but I do).  I'll try the French blend next, but Fog Chaser is definately my new love."
1,"This excellent blend of French Roast and Arabica is just the right level of roast for my taste.  The best price available when you use the recurring purchase program, plus the benefit of the K-cups made mostly of filter paper rather than plastic for disposal purposes."
1,The San Fracisco Bay Coffee One Cups for Keurig K-Cup Brewers have been the best tasting coffee I have had from the Keurig.  I have tried just about every K-cup brand.  This is not packaged in the typical K-cup plastic cups.  It comes in bulk (12 per bag) and the One Cups have the same top as the K-cup but insead of the plastic housing it is a filter material.  This might bother some people.  I store them in a plastic zip lock so they will stay fresh.  The filtering process through a filter rather than the plastic housing might be what makes it taste so good or it may just be the coffee.  It is much less expensive at $13.59 per 36 than the typical K-cups as well as being the best tasting coffee.  I love the French Roast.
1,"Tried these pods since they were on sale, and glad I did.  Very robust but super smooth flavor, almost sweet.  The only downside to these is having to keep them in a sealed bag, which isn't much of a negative...  Can't stop raving about how good this coffee tastes.  My husband loves strong coffee and I usually don't like most of them because they can be bitter.  This is the smoothest strong coffee I have ever had!"
1,If you are a real coffee drinker you will love this brew.  It is fairly stong but I feel that all coffees should be strong.  The flavor is smooth and there is no bitter aftertase.  Try it and you won't be sorry!  It is now my favorite.
1,"This is an original way to produce a K-Cup, it works very well.  The coffee is good overall, and GREAT for the PRICE.  Signing up for AutoDelivery gets you a price per serving that cannot be touched in the K-Cup universe.  Big whoop, so you have to store the unused balance of the dozen per bag in a ziplock bag ---> for several dollars per box I can handle that!"
1,"I love this coffee! This is coming from someone that loves a good cup of coffee and I love this one. We love the dark coffees in the kcups with this one is comparable and a great price. I'm not sure what residue people are talking about- there's nothing to complain about for sure. And the fact that this is a filter and not a giant plastic cup... Awesome! I wish the coffee snobs and the wine snobs would just taste and enjoy their drinks! This coffee deserves 5 stars- 5 for flavor, 5 for cost, and 5 for saving plastic!"
1,"I tried these on the recommendation of other reviews here, and I'm very happy with the product! The taste is smooth and rich, and I didn't have any sediment in the bottom of my cup. The k-cup-type design worked perfectly in my Keurig. Just a really good alternative and better price than regular k-cups."
1,me: Normally drink Rainforest Espresso<br /><br />Tried this due to the price and less plastic.<br /><br />Like it a lot.<br /><br />Very good and love the concept but wish they shipped in a resealable bag or container.
1,"Great fresh-brewed taste for way less than *real* K-Cups! More eco-friendly than all-plastic K-Cups. A mesh bag holds the coffee with no plastic aftertaste. Some reviewers worried that they come in un-resealable plastic bags & not in a fancy, colorful box. I keep them in a zipper-lock plastic bag for freshness and don't worry about not having a pretty box taking up room on the kitchen counter. Enjoy fresh-brewed taste and eco-friendly packaging & forget the box!"
1,"This is pretty good coffee at a very reasonable price compared with other Keurig coffees.  I liken it more to Dunkin coffee than Starbucks.  The pods work fine even though as others have pointed out, they are not true K Cups.  They come in 3 x 12-pod bags, and they stay fresh until you open the bag.  You can reseal the bag with tape, or transfer the pods to a ziplock bag.  I happened to have an OXO coffee storing container that keeps them fresh after they are taken out of their plastic bag.<br /><br />Give 'em a try, they're not half bad, and it sure beats paying $15 for 24 K Cups."
1,"Unlike K-cups, it's container is more like a ""pod"".  The coffee comes sealed in plastic bags so be careful not to cut the plastic bag until you are ready to use the coffee.  This will keep the coffee really fresh.  It's great tasting coffee."
1,"You open the air tight package and the wonderful ordor is enough to start opening your eyes.. You brew it and you start to wake up. you taste, drink and your ready to face the world. The bad part,packaging. you must store the unused k-cups in an air tight container. Overall, I will continue to buy."
1,"This is absolutely the best Keurig Cup coffee I've tasted, and I've tried a lot of them.  (I don't call them K-Cups just because they're made a little differently -- not encased in plastic, just a little filter filled with the grounds.)<br /><br />All the K-Cup varieties I've tried seem to brew a bit on the weak side.  This actually tastes like a full-bodied cup of coffee!  The Fog Chaser flavor is bold by nature, so if you like a milder coffee it might not be your best choice.  It's not bitter like some bold coffees can be -- it's actually quite smooth and seems to have very low acidity.<br /><br />My favorite way to enjoy coffee has always been a French press, but since I found this Fog Chaser coffee I haven't used my press in months.  It's that good."
1,"I bought these ""kcups"" to save money as the cost on my usual Kcups rose to 51 cents a cup on subscribe and save and I could not find them cheaper anywhere else online or locally. These ecocups produce a nice cup of medium strength coffee (not as strong as a regular Kcup). I use the Fog Chase and French Roast on the 12 ounce setting but the Rainforest is too weak to use  so I have to use the 8 ounce setting. The Big plus with these ecocups is that they are really good for use with your own coffee! I use DisposaCup Lids to refill these ecocups over and over again! That's a great vaule at 38 cents a ""Kcup""!! <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NM9YW6"">DisposaCup Lids - 100 Disposable Replacement Lids for Use with Any Keurig K-cup - BOX of 100 LIDS</a>"
1,"I tried the Fog Chaser. It was rich and satisfying. I stored the yet-to-be-used pods in a ziplock bag, and they kept just fine. Used the last one after about 10-12 days - no difference in taste since the first pod from the pack of 12. A great buy, and very competitive with the dark roast K-cups in flavor and depth."
1,"This is my new favorite ""k-cup"" (it's not a k-cup but it fits in all Keurig machines)! It's very strong, but not bitter or burnt--it's just plain great coffee.  I wish I had invented this cheaper version of a k-cup, because this design is genius.  Out of 15 of my cups of this coffee so far, only one had a coffee ground in it--just one little piece.<br /><br />This is best with just cream, it's just plain luxurious!  Thanks SF Bay Coffee!"
1,"I was given a Keurig as a gift and it is so easy to use that I use it almost exclusively.  I had previously used several favorite brands/types of coffee and I ground them fresh for use with a drip pot.<br /><br />Keurig K-cups do not normally meet my expectations, particularly in the strength of the brew but I have adopted the habit of using K-cups for my morning cup to ""chase the fog away"" and the brands I selected for daily use were good but expensive.  This coffee I found as part of a continuous effort to try new brands, to reduce waste but particularly in light of the increase of the price of my favorite brand to ~$0.71/K-cup.  Since I drink a double 7oz brew for that first cup to get enough volume with the brew size reduced for strength, that works out to nearly $1.50 a cup IN MY OWN KITCHEN for a less than premium brew.  This San Francisco Bay Coffee is of more than acceptable flavor and is very nicely priced @ $0.38/K-cup with an automatic repeating order-- close to half the price of my former choice.<br /><br />Incidentally, after the morning dose, if I want more, I then have enough functioning brain cells to recycle used, washed K-cups using the K-saver stainless steel lids <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XRTDVS"">Re-use K-Cups K-Savers Stainless Steel Lid 5 Pack, for Use with Keurig Machine</a> and my favorite Vietnamese coffee which costs ~$0.20/K-cup.  This is the best brew and the least wasteful way but I don't have the patience too do it in the early morning until awake.  I recommend it highly.<br /><br />San Fran Bay coffee are very similar to K-cups but they do not have a complete cup attached to the mesh brew bag.  This eliminates a lot of hard plastic waste."
1,"I saw this brand for the first time at a local supermarket yesterday and figured for $6.49 for a box of 12 (that's 54 cents a cup), I'd give it a try.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, its not actually a plastic K Cup but a rigid rim with a foil lid attached to a filter filled with coffee. The rim sits perfectly in my Keurig machine. When you close the lid of your machine, the product is punctured from the top only. The filter is sort of bowl-shaped and doesn't make contact with the lower puncture needle, but you really wouldn't want it to puncture a filter anyway - you'd have grounds in your coffee. It's a clever idea, actually.<br /><br />I was skeptical about this product because the box doesn't have the ""Keurig"" co-branding that all the others do, but given the variation to the cup design, I can now understand why. I was pleasantly surprised with this product. The taste was quite good and strong, and is the closest thing to real coffee-pot coffee that I've had in 3+ years of Keurig machine cup samplings. I had no coffee grounds in the cup, and it was quite satisfying.<br /><br />By way of background, my all-time favorite variety is Tullys French Roast, and I prefer dark roasts. The box for San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser says its a combination of their regular roast and their french. Its not as strong as Tullys French but it's definitely not weak. My machine is the B77 model which has 4 size settings. Going from small to large, I used the third size which is 7.25 ounces and I was very satisfied with the taste and strength.<br /><br />I wanted to start with the small 12 count box at the market to try them out. Really, who wants 80 cups of something you might not like? But now I know it's a winner, I'll be getting them here regularly where they are even more affordable."
1,"I read some of the reviews and was on the fence about ordering these - I am very glad I did!  I've been having issues with my standard ""Donut Shop"" K-cups not waking me up.  After one cup of Fog Chaser, I was wide awake.  The stuff tastes good too. My wife, who drinks less coffee than me described it as ""Good Diner Coffee"".  The only thing is I recommend storing them in Zip Lock bags (like other people have suggested)."
1,"I put these in a lock and lock container with no freshness  issues.  I thought it was a strong brew. Comparable to Tulleys house blend, emerils. Stronger than newmans. They also were easy to empty out and re-use the container with my own ground coffee. I use the glad press and seal to keep the coffee in.  You just have to make sure the wrap is on taut so the needle pokes through. If its too loose the needle won't puncture and the water all spills over the top, Big Mess!  Good morning brew. Will buy again."
1,"I love discovering and drinking a variety of different coffee's in the never ending quest for the perfect cup.  The K-Cup format makes the trek much easier and enjoyable with the guarantee of a fresh tasting cup every time, as opposed to coffee beans that can go stall plus the convenience of drinking something different with each single cup if I desire.<br /><br />The journey brought me to San Francisco Bay Coffee's Fog Chaser.  Having had the opportunity to travel I had experienced the the brand and was excited to see it ""available soon"" in K-Cups so I didn't hesitate to preorder.<br /><br />As I have come to rely on, Amazon delivered on time and I was anxious to try it the next morning.<br /><br />The Coffee (5 Stars)<br /><br />- Fog Chaser didn't fail to impress. In fact I would say it over delivered on quality based on my expectations - The rich full bodied taste and smooth finish made an excellent addition to my morning routine and I would highly recommend it.<br /><br />The Packaging (2 Stars)<br /><br />-  The K-Cupish like packaging, though innovative leaves room for improvement.  Instead of the traditional solid sealed K-Cup we have all grown use to the San Francisco Bay Coffee comes in a hybrid type packaging.  The coffee is held in a coffee filter material pouch that is attached to a K-Cup like top. It doesn't effect how you us it but it does effect a few other things.<br /><br />First off I seem to get more coffee grounds in my cup than I do with a traditional K-Cup.<br /><br />In addition the individual cups, because the coffee is exposed to air via the filter pouch freshness becomes an issue.  They come in the box sealed in an air tight bag but it is not resealable so once you open it the remaining coffee is exposed.  If this was the only coffee I drank it would probably not be an issue but because I jump around a lot it sits longer effecting the taste.  I guess I could place them in a resealable bag but call me lazy or cheap but I don't and feel I shouldn't have to.<br /><br />Lastly, though very nit-picky the individual cups will not sit in the coffee carousel I have on the counter next to the maker (you probably wouldn't want them to because of the freshness issue) but again it just makes it a little more inconvenient.<br /><br />As I drag myself into the kitchen after loosing the battle with my alarm clocks snooze button and I struggle in to make the first cup to get the caffeine flowing through my system I just don't like to work that hard at it.<br /><br />Summary<br /><br />- The packaging itself will probably not keep me from reordering but it will be much less often than I would normally with some of my other favorites.<br /><br />So with all that said, if the packaging doesn't bother you or effect long term freshness, you are in for a very nice cup of coffee."
1,"Had to try this as soon as I received it. Made a great bold cup of coffee. Was very impressed  with the ""pod"". Very little waste, as compared to the regular k-cups. I will be trying different flavors in the future."
0,I like the idea like most people and saw many good reviews to believe that the coffee will actually taste good.<br />Nope. The taste is terrible and no aroma. The quality of the coffee bean selection need to be improved.<br />Disappointed with my first try of  san francisco bay kcup coffee.
1,"Great coffee and less plastic in the landfills. As stated in earlier reviews, not actually a K Cup, but that's a good thing. My new favorite."
0,"I purchased this after reading the mostly quite positive reviews which equated its taste with Jet Fuel and other bold flavors.  My first cup (medium setting) was off-putting at best. I brewed my second cup on the small-cup setting, hoping for a bolder and richer flavour and mouth feel; none was forthcoming. I appreciate the less plastic packaging and don't find it a bad flavor - I personally don't find the intense boodness I look forward to in a cup of coffee."
1,This is very tasty coffee and a bit cheaper than Keurig-sanctioned k-cups. The pod packaging is minimal.  I agree there is very little waste.  The top looks like a typical k-cup and the bottom looks like a filter.  You will want some sort of tupperware or jar to store the onecups once you open the pouch they come in since they will be exposed somewhat to air and lose freshness otherwise.  I just use a spare ice cream tub and dump the open bag in there.  Perfect!<br /><br />Today I made myself a larger cup than usual by accident and it was still rich and delicious.<br /><br />I usually drink the Newman's own coffee that I buy at Costco to give you an idea of my tastes.  I think this is better.
1,"I love the convenience of K cups but I don't love the waste so I was looking for an alternative. I've already tried the reusable substitutes but I could never get the right grind of coffee beans to produce the coffee flavor/robustness that I like. This coffee is a great bargain for the price, especially with the Subscribe and Save. It is not my absolute favorite, I still prefer Newman's Own blend, but it is better tasting to me than other K Cup offerings(the Folgers blends for example).  I hope San Francisco Bay comes out with more dark/bold roasts because I would definitely try them."
1,"I was really surprised to find a great alternative to the big plastic k-cups, really great coffee and half the price of any brand k-cups.  Thank you!<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006IOKA84/ref=asc_df_B006IOKA842035578?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=asn&creative=395093&creativeASIN=B006IOKA84&hvpos=1o2&hvexid=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=18733440011009391722&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt="
1,"I'm a coffee fiend.  I love coffee dark and strong.  I love this coffee,  It just tastes good.  Some people have complained about the packing bags that the k-cups are stored in.  I just stored the unused portions in a zip lock bag.  Problem solved."
1,"I hesitated placing my first order of the San Francisco Bay Coffee OneCup. After receiving it, I was impressed and thought it was rather good. So glad to find a cheaper alternative to the K-cup."
1,"Nice cup of coffee, I'm not a tree-hugger, but if you are, you will appreciate that it only has a plastic ring/top as opposed to the normal whole plastic k-cup.  I tried it because it is a little cheaper, but still convenient, with the rising cost of coffee (and everything else) compared to grinding yourself and using the ekcobrew (which works much better than the standard k-cup self grind accessory, but is still a bit of a hassle with clean up).  We do vacuum seal a canister with these once we open the plastic bag (the order came with 3 bags of 12 pods), to keep the coffee fresh (since they can't have the oxygen purged like a normal k-cup for freshness).  Overall a nice strong cup that is smooth, with less hassle than self grind and fairly cheap (even cheaper with subscribe and save)"
1,"I have been on Subscribe and Save for Kcups since I bought a Keurig 4 years ago.  At the time, I thought the 'frustration free' box and Coffee People cups were great.  But over the years the price has creeped up and it was brought up my little cups weren't exactly 'green.'  HMPH!  SF Coffee Pod change everything.  First of all it tastes great.  It is the closest to a cup of coffee from a coffee house.  The pod design allows for a greener pod, but also more coffee per pod than a traditional Kcup.  But the real advantage is having the wonderful smell of coffee.  I've missed it.  I have a done of airtight plastic containers that keep the pods fresh and look forward to opening it and smelling the coffee.  :)<br /><br />if you are looking for an alternative for you Keurig, give this a try.  It wins on many levels including, price, taste and smell.  Real coffee fans will understand what I mean."
1,This is great coffee at a great price!  I'm very happy with my purchase and will purchase more in the future.  Yummy.
1,"While some products like the ""My K-Cup"" don't work in all brewers, the Rogers ""One Cup"" products are more compatible.  They work just fine in the Keurig B-3000, which is a large brewer aimed at the office market.  Sometimes you may get the ""no K-cup detected"" warning, but you can ignore it.<br /><br />It's great to have an alternative to the Green Mountain products."
1,"The container is better for the environment and the coffee is very good.  I have tried Fog Chaser, French Roast and Rainforest Blend.  All are very good."
1,"Finally, a k-cup that actually tastes like a ""real"" cup of coffee.  However, keep in mind you cannot use your normal k-cup ""display"" set up that most of you have.  You must keep these k-cups sealed in an airtight container to keep them fresh, as they do not have the plastic housing you are use to.  Perhaps this is why the coffee actually tastes like coffee.  Stick to the Foghouse blend - it's stronger and richer tasting than the other.  The cost is less, most likely because the plastic is missing.  You have a normal coffee filter-type-fabric encasing the coffee. Looks different than your normal k-cup, but tastes soooo much better.  I'm glad I read a review and purchased this product.  Hope you do too."
1,"Great coffee!  Made even better by the fact that the k-cup is not plastic, making it more eco fiendly!  Scores on all counts!  I have already ordered more."
1,"SF Bay Coffee One Cup is a great option. I felt the coffee was stronger, or less watery, than most k-cups, and the price is a big savings.  It comes with 12 in one sealed bag, so I rolled the bag up tightly between uses and used them up within a few days. Not a good choice if you want lots of variety."
1,"The name of this coffee sure caught my eye.  It is indeed a Fog Chaser.  Once or twice a week I get interested in a couple of cups of this delightful French Roast.  Amazon.com sent me an e-mail and I thought it would be fun to give it a try.  It's strong and delightful!!!!  As a senior, I find it's exciting to try new things.  And, some turn out to be winners."
1,"While the container that goes into the brewer looks odd it seems to work well.  The coffee arrived in a box with three individual bags of 12 ""pods"".  I used the first two of these this morning and did not have any problems with the brewing.  They seemed to work just fine.  I liked the strong robust flavor of the coffee."
1,"This is a great deal, and a great coffee. I drink it every morning, great flavor and a great price."
1,"This coffee is wonderful,it fits my cuisinart keurig ,& the price is great. You will not be sorry you try it."
1,"I am pleased with this brand of coffee, great flavor and no waste with the great design. Will be one of my favorite blends now."
1,A strong brew with an unmistakably rich coffee aroma.<br /><br />Ecologically friendly eliminating plastic in the cup itself.<br /><br />Fine addition to k cup selection and wish more coffee distributors would follow suit in their production methods.<br /><br />Good value as well.
0,"This coffee tastes like a good cup of gas station or fast food coffee (i.e., objectively average, at best).  It is not very flavorful, particularly compared to other k-cup brands on the market.  But, this coffee is also 30-50% less expensive per cup.<br /><br />It's also worth noting (as other reviewers have) that these need to be kept in an air-tight container because they are not individually sealed; the bottoms of each cup are semipermeable filters--not air tight plastic like other k-kups.  This is inconvenient if you prefer to keep your k-cups in a k-cup tower next to the machine."
1,"The only reason I won't give the San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser a 5 star, is that once you open the sealed bag the coffee doesn't stay fresh for very long. I enjoyed the coffee, had great aroma and love that it's packaging is reduced plastic compared to original Kcups. The main thing I loved was the price! Just figure out a way to retain freshness and it's gold!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IOKA84"">San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Fog Chaser, 36-Count</a>"
0,"Overall its just OK when considering the price of other K-cups.  The SF Coffee K-cups do not look like other K-cups in that they do not have the plastic base which contains and seals around the coffee filter.  This exposes the coffee to air and faster oxidation.  When drinking the coffee it lacks a fresh flavor and tastes a bit stale.  The K-cups come in a sealed plastic bag, but once its opened, the k-cups are exposed to air and they quickly go stale.<br /><br />The coffee flavor is a bit weak as well.  The lack of the plastic housing around the coffee filter, in my opinion, causes the water to flow thru the coffee too quickly and contributes to a weak flavor.<br /><br />I don't think I would buy these again."
1,It's a different kind of k-cup but it works great.  I liked the coffee too.  I prefer a strong coffee and this one is good.
1,"I like my coffee to have a bold eye opening taste. This Fog Chaser is very good. Great taste and the way they are made is much more environmentally friendly. The price is very good on them also. I have them on a monthly subscription and save even more money. Thank you for having this top quality item..<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IOKA84"">San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Fog Chaser, 36-Count</a>"
1,Love fog chase one cups very strong just like I like it. No strong after taste. And a great price to boot.<br />Just have to store in a ziplock bag.
1,Fog Chaser is my new favorite single-cup coffee. Love it. The fact that it's less expensive per cup than any other brand/variety I've tried (especially from this vendor) is a huge bonus.
1,"I have become a ""Coffee Snob"". I love San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser. I will probably never buy any thing else. The subscribe and save option on Amazon is fantastic. I never have to worry about running out ever again."
1,"As the other reviewers have said, this is not a K-cup!  Having said that, in my experience it is a great inexpensive alternative to use in your Keurig brewer.  I received an order of three 36 count boxes.  The 36 count boxes were unmarked brown cardboard boxes, not the colorful retail packaging shown on amazon.  See the customer image I uploaded.  Inside each cardboard box, there are three clear heavy duty plastic bags, each of which holds 12 of the pods.  I also have uploaded an image of a pod next to a K-cup for comparison.  The bags are not resealable!  You will have to seal them with a clip or put them in an airtight bag or tupperware to prevent the rest of the pods from loosing freshness.  I have found the pods work just as well as a normal K-cup.  I have no complaints about their function.<br /><br />About the coffee:  It is a very strong bold blend.  I think it tastes great, but it is too strong for my wife's taste!  If you like making a bigger cup (running water through the pod twice) it does a great job.  I definitely recommend this if you like strong coffee!"
1,"I received my package today, ""FOG CHASER"" and was the first cup really good. Full body and full taste just like it came ground fresh....and no, i don't know or work for the company, just thought you would like an honest review from someone that buys 6-8 boxes of K-cup coffee a month.<br />I noticed NO sediment in my cup and yes they cut the corner by leaving off the pastic cup to avoid the copyright that says they would then owe Kuerig a percentage....which drives up the price of all coffe in K-cups. IT'S NOT A K-CUP, BUT WILL FIT A K CUP MAKER, and that is what they advertise.<br /><br />I can live with putting the filter cups in a baggie. I don't need to show off my coffee in a carousel, so this is just great to get a ""subscription discount"" for this good of a coffee that will fit my k-cup brewer."
1,When you open the sealed inner bag and this amazing aroma of coffee grabs you and you just can't wait to brew a cup and try it.  This coffee definitely had me at hello... and I knew it was a keeper when I served to guests and they exclaimed that it was the best cup of coffee that they have ever had. I just wish that it was available on subscribe and save like the other San Francisco Bay coffees.  I also really like the environmentally friendly pod.  I think the new packaging works even better than the all plastic cups.<br /><br />***Modified February 2012<br />Yeah!  This coffee is now available on subscribe and save!
1,"Received this yesterday and was quite surprised how good the taste was. I have bought this brand before in the bean version at costco and it was good.  The coffee was bold and smooth. Had less waste than a regular k-cup. Since the pod  below doesnt have a shell, I suggest once the plastic is opened, place them in an airtight container until used. I'd recommend consuming the 12 pack with a few days to a week.  Can't wait to try the other versions of this coffee. I will buy again."
1,"I am recently new to the Keurig world.  I've tried a handful of flavors since I've gotten my machine, and have been just ok with most of the flavors tried.  Fog Chaser has restored my faith in my investment!  Try this!  Coffee shop taste and at a better price than Keurig K Cups!"
1,"I like the product and the price point, but for me, the flavor was very strong and overpowering.  Perhaps I should have figured this out from the &#34;fog chaser&#34; name?"
1,"San Francisco Bay Coffee Fog Chaser One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers is a very nice complement to the Keurig Green Mountain selections.  I am now on my computer with a nice hot cup of the Fog Chaser at my side. I like the fact that there are eight cups to an air tight bag, and that there is an external plastic container for storage after you open one of these bags. A very nice option which I will again use for future purchases."
1,"This coffee has a full body and a rich taste. The price is far below the ""other"" coffee in the K cup and does not use as much plastic."
1,This coffee is delicious. No issues with the packaging. No grounds in brewed cup. Great value! I'll buy other blends in the future. I consider myself a coffee snob and this exceeded my expectations.
1,Not for the timid. Great flavor with a bit of a bitter bite. Longer it sits the better the taste. My number one choice.
1,"I was a little skeptical about the lack of plastic cup around the base of the ""K-Cup"". It fits perfectly in the Keurig brewer and makes the FRESHEST!!!! K-Cup Coffee I have ever had! The individual packs are sealed nicely and upon opening make you entire house smell like a coffee shop! I have put these on auto delivery now!!! yay! Thanks Amazon for offering such great products!!!!!!!"
1,"This coffee is exceptional and always consistent. I say to myself daily ""Wow, this is an amazing cup of coffee"" I will purchase this product many times over."
1,"Was buying the Kona Blend until it dried up and then the price went through the roof. Tried several different K-Cup coffees until I found the Fog Chaser. Now I have it on my subscribe and save list. I have it sent to my office, my home, my son's home every month. It ain't Kona but it is almost as bold, the aroma fills the kitchen in the morning and that first sip is great every time.<br />And at 1/2 the price of the Kona, it is the ""best bang for the buck"". I'll never go back."
1,I really enjoy the San Francisco Bay Coffee Company stuff.  The Fog Chaser is what I need to get going.  The strong full-bodied flavor will get you up and going.  It is smooth and not bitter.  You also can't beat the price on this Kcup.. I will be buying this again!!!!
1,"The k-cup coffee pods arrived right on time, even a little early. They are shaped differently on the bottom which other reviews had mentioned. They fit perfectly into my coffee maker and it looks as though there is less plastic waste than the other k-cups I have seen.<br /><br />I like strong, full bodied flavor- so does my husband- and we were both extremely happy with this find.<br />I am going to see if there is a way to get set up for monthly auto delivery.<br /><br />I will order from this merchant again...and again...and again."
1,I recently had the opportunity to try the Fog Chaser blend and loved it. Bought this based on that positive experience. The K-cups are quite novel - the base is a filter instead of plastic and they work GREAT.The Rainforest expresso blend is also quite nice. Try the breakfast blend for a little lighter roast.
1,"The San Francisco Bay coffee in the 36 count is a very cost effective way to get coffee for a Keurig machine.  I am serving in Afghanistan and it was in my hands 5 days after ordering!  I could not be more pleased with the coffee package value and the Fog Chaser blend is a bold, yet low acidic flavor.  I highly recommend it!"
1,Really like the price and the package of the Kcup filter vs plastic.  We really like the flavor also.  We will continue to purchase.
1,"As many other reviews have mentioned, these are not the normal K-Cups, but they work much the same. I generally drink the stronger K-cups (Emeril's, Jet Fuel, Kona, etc), and I find that these Fog Chaser pods compare very favorably. There is no bitter aftertaste, just smooth flavor. I have not had any sediment at the bottom of my cup (I've had sediment from other K-Cups). I think people are a bit thrown by the smell of the coffee bag when they get it, as it is a much stronger smell than you'll get from a box of K-Cups. It does smell like when you open a fresh bag/can of ground coffee, which is sort of refreshing after using K-Cups for 3 years. We've just finished the first bag of 12 (6 days), which we kept in a ziplock bag, and the last cup tasted as good as the first. I already placed a subscribe and save order for the French Roast to try out. I will be keeping my subscription for the Fog Chaser, as it is quite good."
1,"Fog Chaser is my favorite coffee and I buy it in whole beans for when I brew a full pot.  I have used it for years and would not think of changing.  When I saw Amazon had Fog Chaser for the Keurig I was thrilled. The flavor is full bodied and rich with a very smooth finish.<br /><br />Because I was familiar with Fog Chaser, I never even looked at the reviews before I made my purchase.  Therefore, I was rather surprised when I opened the box and saw the different type of pod.  With a filter bottom the pod seems much more environmentally friendly.  There was no residue at the bottom of my mug so the filter did a good job.  I agree with other reviewers of the need to keep these pods in a vacuum sealed container (or zip lock bag) but I think the use of less platics is a good thing.<br /><br />I have a B60 and these fit perfectly in the machine. I used the large cup setting and the strength of the coffee was perfect for my taste (I prefer stronger coffee).  Before purchasing Fog Chaser I was buying Jet Fuel."
1,"These Keurig compatible onecups are a cross breed design resembling a Kcup top with a pod body.<br />They come 12 servings sealed in a vacuum bag with freshness seal. This is then placed in a attractive retail type box<br />that would look right at home on the shelf next to kcups at your favorite retail store.<br />The front of the Box has a drawing of a kcup machine and a blow up of the 1 cup inserted in it.<br />It also lists a few of the compatible keurig type brewers it will work in.<br />The top and back of the box has some photos of environmental projects that the Rogers Family has been involved in.<br />one side has a photo of the rodgers family and their mission statement. The other side has a description of the coffee contained in the box.<br />I can see how these should sell well in the retail setting and also appeal to environment conscious individual and those who are just curious about a new alternative to the standard kcup.<br />I have a Box of Fog Chaser described on the box as a blend with the body of our regular roast and the smokiness of our French roast. A heavy full bodied with hints of cedar,vanilla and toasted almonds<br />balanced with a delicate finish with honey and milk chocolate flavors. Sure sounds appealing to me.<br />When I cut the seal on bag I'm hit with a very strong dark roast scent right away and something poignant but can't place the smell. Maybe it's the ceder they describe on the box and I'm intrigued to brew and try it.<br />Fits in my B70 perfectly and I use the 7.25 oz drop as I normally do. Smells good during brewing just like the extra bold dark roast Kcups I normally drink.<br />Brewed perfectly with no issues. Smells and tastes great in the Cup. Strong full bodied french roast with a smooth finish and I like it as does the wife.<br />I'm not one to name flavors and stuff like that so you will have to try it yourself for a more specific taste profile. Suffice it to say I give Fog Chaser a Big thumbs."
1,"These do not look like regular K-cups. And perhaps they won't keep as long because the bottom looks like it's made of rounded cloth, kind of like a tea bag. But they fit Keurig machines just fine, are less expensive, and most importantly I think this coffee tastes better than the coffee in plastic K-cups. I actually prefer the fact that the bottom is not made of plastic. I never liked the idea that my hot coffee was being strained through a plastic cup. In fact, I just ordered more."
1,"This coffee is great in my Keurig and alot more reasonably priced here at Amazon. Shipping was fast and worry free. I really like the fact that this comes packed in 10 individual packs of 8 k-cups each. The reason for this is that these k-cups are different in their construction. Each one is plastic at the top but filter for the lower 3/4 of the k-cup. At first I thought..oh no..I see a big mess coming, but to my great surprise, everything went perfectly. I like this design for two reasons, one..they are made with green practices in every way possible, and..two..they brew alot faster than the regular k-cups. The taste is great, bold and deep mellow flavor, this is my new coffee for sure."
1,"I am the buyer for a 20-person department.  The folks who like a bold strong coffee love this one.  I like it as well, but I use the 10-oz setting when I make it instead of my typical 8-oz.<br />""Fogchaser"" sums it up pretty well.  This will clear your head and get you ready to roll.<br />I also love that there is less packaging.  I must admit to a bit of guilt over the whole K-Cup disposal situation.  (I make people use china coffee cups and am happy to wash them!)  These do not have the plastic outer cup.  I keep them in a plastic container with a sealed lid instead of in the K-Cup carousel to keep them fresher.  But I gotta tell you--opening that lid yields the most wonderful coffee aroma."
1,"Finally, a robust, bold coffee from a Keurig coffee pot.  I had trouble finding one that wasn't wimpy, but this is it!  And it is cheaper than any other.  As an added benefit, the k-cups are constructed in a much more earth-friendly way, no plastic cup.  Why don't other brands go this route?"
1,"I was really lured in by the price and eco-friendly ""pod"" cup. I had read the good and bad reviews and decided it was worth trying the Fog Chaser. Well, I loved it! My cup was as bold and rich as traditional plastic K-cups and better than the reuseable cups (My K-cup, Ekobrew). This will be a mainstay in my coffee selection due to the flavor and affordability. I highly recommend trying it.<br /><br />Hopefully, someone can comment on whether these will work for the new Keurig Vue machine."
1,"Yes, it's hard to get used to the different design of these (paper-filter bottom), but they work fine in my Keurig Platinum B-70 and have enough coffee to make a bold, 10-oz cup.<br /><br />The flavor of ""Fog Chaser"" is strong and complex -- it took me a few days to get used to it, but now it is one of my favorites (tied with Timothy's Midnight Magic).<br /><br />I'm so glad that the patent on K-cups has expired so we can have some new companies making them, producing great products at lower price.  Hooray for the free market! (smile)"
1,Very tasty coffee well worth the price. Comes with a container to put open coffee in. I will definently buy this coffee again.
1,I have bought this coffee on a few different occasions.I love the full bodied taste and also the price.I'm always looking for a good deal and this is a great one !
0,We threw this away. It is the very worse coffee I have ever bought. Undrinkable. Their french roast is much better.
1,Fog chaser was the best both in flavor and body.  So far this is the only product that the body is compatible to the richer flavor of blew coffee that uses k-cup system.
0,"When I first got the pods I loved them but after a couple of weeks in opened or unopened packages these pods must have lost their freshness because the coffee does is just not the same and it's pretty much awful at this point, I am sorry I went ahead and purchased 160 more pods after the first 36 because now I'm stuck with them and I can't stomach them nor can anyone in my family."
1,"If you like bold coffee, Fog chaser and French roast is for you. It has a filter only. No plastic shell. That leaves more richness in the coffee and no plastic taste."
1,"Its about time some one came up with a viable alternative to the more expensive coffee single cup brewers. this is a great product, its not Star bucks, but it works."
1,"It takes trying a few other brands of coffee, to find one that is very tasteful and smooth to the taste. My opinion is: San Francisco Bay Coffee, Fog Chaser is the best."
1,"Love Fog Chaser:  Strong, smooth and, I believe,  like all San Francisco coffee k-cups,  no plastic to toss into the garbage."
1,"The San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser's provide a pretty decent bold coffee at a phenomenal price.  It's about HALF THE PRICE of common competitors.  Well worth ordering.  If you don't like it, you can spend 2X the $$$ on something else the next time. I bet you'll be satisfied with the Fog Chaser."
1,The San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser coffee is one of my favorites.  Full bodied but not bitter - very flavorful.  I really like the design of this product instead of the regular K-cups.
1,"With my Keurig brewer I try to keep the per-cup costs down by shopping around. When I saw the San Francisco Bay products I was intrigued, mostly because of price, but also concerned, as they are not sealed in a container (the bottom portion is a mesh). While I do need to keep the product in a sealed container for freshness, the coffee is good and the cost is right."
1,I never thought I would get decently-strong coffee with my Keurig on the largest brewing size.  I was wrong -- this coffee rocks!  It's nice to know that I'm saving some plastic from the landfills too -- it's a small price to pay for keeping the opened cups in a zip-loc bag.  I can't wait to try some of their other flavors!
1,"For the price, this is one great cup of coffee! I love the fact that the San Francisco Bay coffee cups for Keurig brewers do not have the typical plastic containers. I hate throwing away all that plastic. I tried washing out those little containers but that was such a pain! So these coffee containers make much more sense. The coffee tastes great and the aroma is even better than the original Keurig cups. This is a good alternative and a fantastic price."
1,"We really like this product. It came in a number of smaller packs, and there was a plastic tub for open bags. I did not have any trouble keeping the coffee fresh. The taste and quality were very good. Similar to s-bux Verona, at a lot lower price! I would purchase this again, any time!"
1,This is very good coffee. The one thing that bothered me about the Keurig Coffee maker is when you made a full cup of coffee it was very weak. With this coffee I can make a full cup and it is very strong. I think it has something to do with the filter pod. I would recommend this if you like good strong coffee.
1,"Really, really good coffee!  A bold flavor with that touch of nuttiness that I prefer.  We compost and was hoping for something totally compostable that could simply be thrown in the bin. This is much preferable to the old K-cups but still the plastic top remains for the trash.  I see no reason why a fully compostable product could not be developed."
1,"Since kcups are becoming more and more expensive, we've tried some alternative coffees for our Keurig. These ""soft bottom cups"" allow easier brewing and I think they make a stronger coffee. I like the decaf brew, and my husband loves the Fog Chaser. The only down side is they are not sealed, they have a soft filter bottom and they need to be stored in an airtight container, but who cares if it's cheaper and tastes good? We will continue to buy from San Francisco."
1,"If you like strong coffee or need a jolt to get started, this is the drink for you.  Innovative mesh cup may be an enhancement to the brew flow through, but probably limits shelf life if you let it set in the cabinet too long.  I drink a bit more coffee than one should so shelf life isn't an issue.  Worth the try, great aroma and full caffeine feel.  Gets a thumbs up from me."
1,"I am very much enjoying FogChaser.  The flavor is great!<br /><br />As other posts have mentioned, it does not look like a traditional K cup (which is, incidentally, why the price is so great! No ""k-cup"" royalties, right?) but works just like a Kcup.  The coffee is packaged in bags freshness, and the company thoughtfully included a plastic food storage container for storing the open package.  Sure, it's a cheap-o container, but it works and I think it was a really nice touch by the company to ensure that my opened package of coffee stays fresh.<br /><br />The price is HALF of what I've been paying for my K-Cups from the supermarket, so I am VERY very pleased.  My household goes through 8-10 cups a day, so the savings is significant for us.  5 stars!<br /><br />Happy. :-)"
1,"Tried something new with these paper pods. The coffee is great, smells really good and tastes even better. Every once in awhile the pod gets stuck, but is easy to remove. Makes me feel a bit better about throwing away so much plastic as in other Keurig pods."
1,"great bargain  great coffee  all that I needed in a very easy to use pod.(smaller than a k-cup, same<br />amount of coffee)"
1,"I am a helpless coffeeholic and a devoted Keurig User. I was so dissapointed in the k-cups after the Green Mountain takeover, almost to the point of looking for another brewing method. Then my brother in law suggested I try this coffee. WOW! One of the best cups I have ever had from my Keurig.  Not so thrilled with the Rain Forest blend but the Fog Chaser is the bomb! Don't confuse this with Fog Litter. Don't let the difference in the pod scare you, works great in my brewer. I just ordered a pack of the French Roast. Can't wait to try it."
1,"Got these for my husband who loves a bold coffee flavor, he said they were terrific and he really enjoyed them, the pods look a little strange but they work perfect."
1,I love this coffee. I love getting a value on it. I use it everyday in my Keurig coffee maker. Thanks for a great product.
1,"I like the strong yet mellow taste of  this coffee.  It's a good way to start a dreary morning.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IOKA84"">San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Fog Chaser, 36-Count</a>"
1,It has good flavor. I use it on the 8 ounce cup size & it is not watery or weak
1,"We were skeptical when we ordered, and received, this product.  It doesn't look like it would fit a Keurig, and is not our top brand coffee.  We both ended up liking it very much, and end up rooting around for the last FOGCHASER, since it is now OUR favorite.  It's nice it has less plastic/packaging than other brands as well...."
1,"I've had many other k-cups and none were ever strong enough for me.  This one still isn't quite as strong as I'd make myself, but it's close.  Very enjoyable.  One great thing that I noticed in the packaging (80-count) was that they included a plastic container which fit 1 bag of the cups very easily.  This will serve me well in keeping the unused but open-bag cups fresh."
1,"I was a little hesitant to try these, but eventually decided why not try & see for yourself.  Im so glad I did.  These are by far my favorite coffee pods. Once I open the bag, I just put them in an airtight container.<br />I pay 41 cents a piece for them which is a deal against other brands.<br />The coffee is full bodied & tastes great."
1,Great coffee.  I use these Keurig-compatible sengle serve units both a home and in the office.  I am just about to place a follow-up order.
1,"I love this coffee.  It works great with K-cup type brewer even though it is not a k-cup.  Since it is not a full plastic cup, I do store the units in a covered canister.  Using a canister instead of the rack is a small price to pay for the difference in price to regular K-cups.  The coffee has wonderful flavor.  I like a bold cup of coffee in the morning.  If I dont have this, I drink Donut Shop.  I like the San Francisco Bay so much, I get two boxes on auto ship every month."
1,this is the best K-cup flavor so far.  Chases my fog away. Has a nice finish. not to bitter....just smoooth.
1,Have been getting this coffee for several months and very much like their bold flavor in comparison to others I've tried. Keep it air tight after opening is not a big deal. great coffee!
1,"This brew seems to light a bit more of a fire under me than previous k-cups I've tried. Perhaps that's why they call it ""Fog Chaser."" Enjoy"
1,This coffee is a great deal!  All the coffee drinkers in the house enjoy it - will purchase again.  Compared to many others we have tried this is in the top 5.
1,"I ordered and recieved my box of 40 pods of coffee from San Francisco Bay.  When I opened the box I was alarmed that the pods were not K cups. Well, I popped the first pod into my Kuerig coffee machine and what came out was the aptly named foggy coffee.  Dark coffee that had a nice bite to it.  I will be ordering more products from this company as their coffee rocks the house. The price was better than the K cups and it is because, I suspect, the pods that they make are a plastic ring with the coffee encased in coffee filter paper.  I dont konow if they created these new pods but the are ingenious and they work perfectly, well done!"
1,"The 1-cup pods work fine in my Keurig brewer - slightly more sediment at the bottom of my cup. I would like to see more variety in the blends available. I find the fog chaser to be a bit bitter for my tastes, I'll just add more sugar! I like that I'm not wasting so much plastic on every cup."
1,"Excellent morning coffee to jumpstart the day, robust , but  not too strong. I have tried many brands over time; Chase that fog away!!"
1,"I have been ordering Coffee People's Jet Fuel K-cups for years.  I never really liked wasting all the plastic so I was happy to give these a try.  The coffee is very comparable in strength and tastes great!  But most of all, the design of these k-cups eliminates a large portion of the plastic and work great!  You do need to store them in an air-tight container, but they came packaged in separate 12-pack sealed bags which will keep the coffee fresh until I'm ready to use it.  I'm willing to change my storage container in order to help the environment just a little.  So willing that I just cancelled my Coffee People Subscribe & Save order and replaced with SFBay's Fog Chaser!"
1,"I will definitely buy the San Francisco Bay Coffee again.  After I try the other flavors, I will use the subsription plan.<br /><br />After meeting my husband, I started drinking darker roast coffees, and this Fog Chaser was bold and delicious.  But the biggest reason why I tried this brand was because of the lack of the extra plastic.  I've felt bad about the excess plastic that was being discarded with K-cups.  I've bought a wide variety of gadgets that are compatible with Keurig, all in attempts to reduce waste.  Some had a re-usable cup with small inner paper filter, (which I still use when I acquire my own ground coffee) others were caps that went over re-used K-cups after they were emptied and rinsed.  But that all takes time that I don't always have.  I feel better that these have less waste PLUS they're less expensive than regular K-cups.  A subscription will make it that much cheaper.<br /><br />The box has separate bags of 8 coffee pods each.  I don't think maintaining freshness is an issue for me, since once I open up a bag, I simply put them in a sealed plastic container.  There is one plastic container included in the box, but it's a little on the flimsy side, certainly not Tupperware tough, but it's still enough to store these.  I drink one to two cups a day, so the opened bag doesn't have a chance to sit around long anyways.<br /><br />This fit perfectly in my Keurig machine, too.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this to others."
1,This quickly became my favorite coffee I make every morning.  Strong enough to make on larger setting without losing it's coffee goodness.  I make it on smaller setting sometimes when I want even stronger. There is never a bitter after taste.  The only negative thing I can say is I can't use my carosel to store these pods. I keep in a Ziplock type bag that keeps them quite fresh.
1,"Tried this pod coffee with a bit of trepidation, first it was a new style pod and 2nd it had several bad reviews.  Tried it anyway and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />1. New pod style worked great.  No issues what so ever.  They pack the pods in small bags so the air does not oxidize the remaining pods.  I use a clip to seal the bag back up after opening.  Maybe they could add a self seal bag type but then they would raise the price on me.  Leave it as is.<br /><br />2. Coffee was great.  Very bold just like I like it.  In fact it was better than the other bolds on my Amazon Subscribe and Save list.  This coffee pod just made the list.<br /><br />All I can say about the reviewers that did not like the bold taste is that perhaps they are only ""wanna be"" bold coffee drinkers.  Maybe they should practice more and then try this blend again."
1,"I was a little worried due to a few bad rewiews, but this coffe was great, smelled good, tasted great and the price was right!so glad I tried it."
1,"I love coffee.<br /><br />I drink it in the morning, in the afternoon, and right before bed.  However I had yet to find a k-cup that gave me the full bodied taste that brewing a nice strong 1:1 ratio pot ever gave me.  I tried all the usual suspects.. green mountain, starbucks, caribou, donut, etc.  While I normally love their whole bean, ground, and coffee shop stuff.. I just could never find a full taste in any of them.  So, I gave up on k-cups and went back to my trusty home drip brewer.<br /><br />Then one day our company bought kuerig machines for the office.  So, I decided that I'd go out and try to find a decently priced k-cup, as anything tastes better than the sludge that they make in their industrial drip machines.  These are what I found, and whether it's the coffee, the lack of plastic on the bottom, or some combination, I'd have to say these K-Cups are the absolute closest thing I've found to a regular cup of coffee.  It bold, but not hit you over the head bold.  It isn't watered down.  It's perfect.<br /><br />Anyway, give them a try if you want a great cup of coffee for a great price.  Don't let their look scare you off.  It's perfect."
1,"First off if you are wondering, they are not K-cups.  The coffee is in an innovative filter pouch with a ring that fits K-cup type coffee makers.  The packaging is thoughtful, 8x 10 packs with a resealable cup for the open pack of coffee your working on. As far as taste its very good coffee, but strong ( fyi I drink coffee black like God intended). I typically make a 16 oz cup of coffee with one 'pouch' of coffee.  So for me it good tasting coffee at a  screaming deal as compared to traditional K-cups."
1,"If you are looking for a consistent cup of coffee with a nice flavor and one thats more robust then this one may be for you. My wife and i subscribed to this coffee after reviewing others opinions and for the price, its a great coffee. Works well in a Keurig machine. Id recommend it."
1,"I first tried San Francisco Bay Rainforest blend, and loved it, but then decided to try their Fog Chaser, and wow, what a great taste. It's a little stronger, but yet not too strong. A great blend, and it offers a nice change in taste. Love it, and again, a great bargain."
1,"I was really surprised to like this coffee this much. Some of the lesser-priced coffees claiming to work in a Keurig have not been so good. This coffee is excellent - and less expensive to boot! I'm picky about my coffee. I like a dark, bold roast, but find many to be bitter. This roast is smooth and flavorful.<br /><br />While I've not been really good about going out of my way to use ""greener"" products, I'm happy to buy a product that I really like and also happens to be more environmentally friendly.<br /><br />A couple of potential downsides with this new style of k-cup:<br /><br />1) since the filter part containing the coffee is more exposed than a traditional kcup that is encased completely in plastic, I suspect these SFB kcups may not stay fresh for very long. HOWEVER, in the 36-cup pack that I purchsed through Amazon, the company has seen fit to package the cups in 3 heavy, sealed plastic bags, so you only have to open, and expose to the air, 12 kcups at a time. Sidenote: the bag emits a WONDERFUL aroma when you open it!<br /><br />2) Also due to less plastic packaging over the filter, I notice more coffee ""sludge"" at the bottom of my cup than I see with traditional style kcups. This doesn't bother me. I just don't drink that last little bit in my cup. The coffee I DO drink is so rich and flavorful that this just isn't an issue for me.<br /><br />3) I take my new SFB kcups to work and use in the heavy-duty machine used there. Due to the smaller length of these kcups, some Keurig brewers don't recognize the cup as actually being there when you insert it in the basket. However, you can easily override this. When the machine says ""no kcup detected,"" it will usu. also say, ""continue? yes or no"" and you simply press yes. The machine will still function, as it would if you were using it simply to brew a cup of hot water.<br /><br />I will definitely order more of these kcups and am interested in trying other blends in addition to the Fog Chaser. Taste-wise, cost and ease of ordering: an all around ""win"" for me!"
1,"Went out on a limb and purchased this based solely on the reviews.  Wisconsin resident so not much ability to get to CA to try things out!  So happy with this purchase.  I love the flavor, I love the reduced packaging.  Perfect cup of coffee."
1,This is one of the best coffees in a K-cup I have had. It doesn't have that after bite that some full flavored coffees have. Love the mesh container as apposed to the plastic cups. The value is great works out to about 41 cents per cup. I am on my second box & it will probably be the only K-cup coffee I will order from now on. Love it!
1,"This coffee is really delicious and the pods are so convenient and less wasteful, plus cost less.  I would recommend this product to anyone that is a coffee lover.  Its always fresh and convenient.  If you are wanting to try it you won't be disappointed."
1,Initially I had read several bad reviews about this product and would not consider it.  I tried another brand of bold coffee after I was notified Timothy's Midnight Magic would no longer be available on Subscribe and Save.  I was searching for another K-Cup and found the more recent reviews for this brand of coffee were more positive.  With the first cup I was hooked.  Good strong coffee and no bitter after taste. Fog Chaser by San Francisco Bay is the best K-Cup coffee I've had and am now signed up for regular deliveries.
1,"Don't hesitate to buy this fantastic coffee. And, don't let the price fool you! I was elated to see Fog Chaser packaged for the Keurig system. Having bought this blend before I knew what to expect, and it didn't let me down. It delivers a full-bodied cup of coffee, with a fantastic nutty, sweet kinda spicy-chocolaty finish. On the technical side, I like that they've figured out a way to work around using all the plastic. These ""K-Cups"" are an ingenious design using a filter instead. Absolutely a splendid cup of coffee all around. This product has been added to my Subscription orders with Amazon."
1,"This is great coffee for the Keurig Coffee Maker.  It is not the strongest coffee around, but everyone in our family likes the flavor and it's always fresh."
1,"I am a rather late comer to the K-cup world. I have always loved my the flavorful and bold 'one cup at a time' coffee faithfully brewed by my cherished <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009314RQ"">Gaggia 90501 Titanium SS Super Automatic Espresso and Cappuccino Machine, Stainless Steel</a>. After six years of faithful service my Gaggia developed an issue requiring it to be sent off for repair, so I purchased a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MZYZHU"">Breville BKC700XL Gourmet Single-Serve Coffeemaker with Iced-Beverage Function</a>. The Breville is intended to be an interim coffee maker while my beloved Italian Gaggia is sent off for repairs (a 3 month endeavor).<br /><br />I don't think of myself as a coffee snob, but I will admit to being particular about the coffee I drink. I was now faced with the challenge of finding some of my favorite coffees in the new to me K-Cup containers. As I came to the realization that my old favorite beans were not readily available in this medium I turned to Amazon buyer ratings as my guide in this java quest. I placed orders for both <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00461AF2W"">Emeril's Big Easy Bold 48 K-Cups</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007TGDXMU"">San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Breakfast Blend, 80-Count</a> as a starting point. The SFB Breakfast Blend arrived first. I read all about the Rogers SF Bay family coffee business philosophy and their social give back and thought it was pretty cool. I then looked at their K-cups (OneCups) and thought to myself, ""is that how these things are supposed to look?"" Their OneCups take a more Eco-friendly construction approach so that you see a rounded filter bottom rather than the standard shaped plastic cup bottom. It all seemed interesting, but how would it taste? I thought the Breakfast Blend was really a lovely cup of coffee. The smooth medium-dark roast Central and South American beans are very tasty indeed! I would venture to say that it is on par with any of the very best medium-dark roast coffees available. I would never turn my nose up at it, that is certain. However my personal pallet preference is for something a bit more dark and bold. Three days later I received the Emeril's Big Easy Bold order and immediately tried it. It certainly delivered on all aspects of a robust dark roast with full flavor. It is a bold, dark, classic Parisian roast, in your face brew, just the way I like it. However I find it to have an ever so slight unpleasant aftertaste and a not too far away from, but not quite there bitter finish. Again this is just according to my palette, you may not think so. All in all it is a very good coffee.<br /><br />The SFB Fog Chaser arrived and I couldn't wait to try it out. I cut the seal on bag and was hit with the scent of a strong dark roast. I placed the now familiar OneCup container in the machine and hit brew. Immediately the aromas hit my nose and let me know that I was in for a treat. Fog Chaser is a strong full bodied French Roast with an extremely smooth finish. It is certainly bolder than Breakfast Blend, but is not as bold as Emeril's Big Easy Bold. The taste is full, smooth and well rounded without any unpleasant bitterness or aftertaste at all. I wouldn't have minded if the yield had been slightly stronger though. My next order will be <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IOKA70"">San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, French Roast, 36-Count</a> to see how it compares to these three. Until that time, I give SFB Fog Chaser two big thumbs up!! It is currently at the top of my K-cup coffee taste experience."
1,"The subscribe & save service is good, product was delivered as required and actually did save me money! The coffee is great and has a good full bodied taste, just what I need to wake me in the mornings."
1,A grat tasting cup of coffee at  a great price. I also like the design of this Kcup. Les plastic. I get this item on subscription which brings the price down even more
1,"this is my third purchase of the fogchaser kcups and i will keep buying it!  The taste is on the darker side, kind of like a SBUX french roast, but much tastier.  The smell from the bag when I open it is just heavenly!  I also like that the cup isn't all plastic, just the plastic top with mesh bottom.  I have had no occurence of the mesh bottom ripping open after about 200 of these."
1,"This is a great tasting coffee. But not as strong as I was hoping for. I expected it to be stronger then the french and on the lines of Black Tiger and Jet. In my opinion, it's not as strong. I was disappointed. But still a nice flavor."
1,Pretty good coffee a little bitter for me but most strong coffees are. The price is great though and its worth it and will order it again.
1,"Fog Chaser was great. I ordered it twice and will continue to order it. It comes nicely boxed and packaged beauifully. I bought the 80 count box and the price was the best I found, Under 50 cents a cup."
1,This is my new favorite coffee!  And the price is a great value too.  I first tried this coffee from a local grocery store and was thrilled that I can purchase it through Amazon in 80 ct package at a great price.
1,"The only coffee that actually gets me going in the morning. I love the rich aroma and deep coffee taste. The is no funky aftertaste, just a good kick of caffeine energy. This coffee rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Very rich and flavorful coffee.  I like the pods without the plastic case.  Requires storage in a sealed container.  This is a very good everyday smooth coffee.  The story on the side of box is compelling.
1,"This coffee has wonderful flavor and brews very well.  Works perfectly in our Keurig coffee maker.  Really like the pod style, actually easier to use than the cups.  Great product!"
1,I lover this coffee and will keep buying it.  I never drink Decalf but since getting a Keurig I can have a cup when I get home without brewing a whole pot and just love this decalf as it has the flavor of a full roast coffee.
1,Tastes excellent and is great for the price. Shipped quickly and the pods came in batches in plastic packages so the pods don't expire.
1,"San Franciso Bay is an nice, inexpensive alternative to the K-cup.  I like a bold cup of coffee and this one comes through.For the money, this brand is well worth trying.  I paln to purchase again. It works well in my Keurig."
1,This coffee smells really good.  Even the non-coffee drinkers in my office comment on how rich it smells.  Coffee lovers have been just breathing deeply!  LOL!  This was a test and it passed.  Took some getting used to but I have come to really like it.
1,"I ordered San Francisco Bay Coffee Fog Chaser because of the title ""fog chaser"" and the price was good. We were pleasantly surprised with the make up of the k-cup.  It is not all plastic, it is made up of a fiber which means, to me, less plastic for my hot coffee to run through.  I am pleased with the product and even signed up for the automatic delivery option so we don't have to be without good coffee when we get up in the morning."
1,This is very good coffee.  Despite a number of previous reviews to the contrary this style K-Cup works very well.  The price is also lower than the competition.  I would recommend you try a package and make up your own mind.
1,"I just received this product.  I was a little hesitant with the product not being enclosed in the cup fully, having an exposed filter.  I was pleased with the brewing and taste of the coffee, it was no different than other kcups I have used.  I have a Cuisinart K-cup brewer and it works great with this coffee.  I recommend this product and plan on ordering more."
1,I was very happy with my purchase of the fog chaser coffee. I will definately buy more of it in the future.
1,Nice product for the price. All you have to use is a zip lock bag because they use a screen for the bottom of the cup. Good medium cup of coffee.
1,"I had been purchasing Coffee People Jet Fuel Dark Roast K-Cup from Amazon. I was pleased with the taste of the brew. The price of the product was moderate, which appealed to my senior income. One day my sister told me about the San Francisco Bay K-Cups which she had just purchased from Amazon.  She indicated that the medium blend of coffee she ordered was very good and suggested that I try it. I prefer dark roast so I ordered the Fog Chaser One Cup.  I am thoroughly pleased with the coffee and economically it suits my budget.  I highly recommend it."
1,"I am so happy to have found this product.  The different type of cup was no problem at all, is more environmentally friendly, and the coffee is wonderful.  The price is another advantage."
1,I've been using the SF Bay Coffee - Fog Chaser - for several months now and it has become my coffee of choice.  I will select others as a change of pace but use Fog Chaser as my everyday selection.  I highly recommend it!
1,"I am a coffee lover. Drink it all the time, prefer dark roasts with full flavor and typically drink it black unless i crave a drop of honey. I used to buy the very expensive dark roast K-cups but i saw these on sale and decided to try them based on the good reviews. First, the cup itself is awesome.  Far less plastic than 'regular' K-cups, so there's less waste. The flavor is awesome-- dark brew but no bitterness or sourness.  Nice bite, clean aftertaste.  This, in my opinion, tastes more like my local coffee house brew than any other K-cup on the market.  and Amazon has great prices on these, especially with subscribe & save."
1,"I was leary to order this coffee but after reading other reviews I decided to give it a try. Very good taste if you like the taste of coffee,"
1,"I thought I would like this because I like to think I like bold coffee.  Wow, this isn't bold.  It is stand up and knock your socks off it is soooo bold even at the biggest setting.  So if you enjoy a powerful cup of coffee this is for you.  By the way the filters work great in my machine and all else is perfect; if only I liked the coffee.  So after being knocked to the floor by my coffee this morning I am going to crawl over and try the breakfast blend. Four stars for the filters and minus one star for my personal preference on the coffee."
1,in error the review I just submitted attched to emeril's big easy (also excellent)<br />now down to business.<br />just recieved my first order of s.f. bay / fog chaser immediatly made a cup.<br />was unsure as I just purchesed a cusinart k-cup mach. worked perfectly regardless.<br />the strength / flavor is all it was touted. & the price is resonable<br />I'll be back often!!!!<br /><br />billw......
1,"I was having trouble finding a good everyday coffee for my new Keurig. I like a strong flavor, but all the ""bold"" ones I tried were too bitter, some even tasted burned. The ""not-bold"" ones were too weak. I decided to give the San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser a try because of the reviews, recommendations from friends, and I like their minimal packaging. This coffee is great! Exactly what I was looking for, a strong rich coffee flavor with no bitterness. Perfect for me!"
1,"Overall, great price, nice medium to bold taste!  I also like the ""less plastic"" container as it helps cut down on oil consumption and helps the environment."
1,I have purchased 3 flavors of SanFrancisco Bay Coffees and have been pleased with all of them.  The pod is a bit different than the typical K-cup but the flavor of the coffee is GREAT.
1,I have used a K-cups for years. Found San Francisco Bay Coffee cups and decided to give a try.  As soon as I opened the first bag I knew it was going to be amazing.<br />The smell of the coffee grounds was awesome.  I did not know until then how I missed the smell of fresh grounds.  That woke me up immediately. Love the Fog Chaser coffee!  Can not wait to try other flavors!  Highly recommend.
1,"This coffee is just what I wanted - not too bitter and not as strong as some coffees. The aftertaste is easy and smooth. I appreciate the packaging into smaller groups of cups, in order to keep the coffee fresh."
1,I used to drink Newman's Special Blend or Starbucks Sumatra but this is at least as good and cheaper. I'll spring for the 80-cup box this time.
1,"I've been looking for a good quality coffe for my Keurig, and have tried many options (Starbucks, Mountain Green, and others).  I now found my coffe, good robust flavor, no bitterness."
0,I found this coffee very weak - I had to lower the cup size to get some flavor.  I would not order this again.
1,"Found these by accident on amazon. If you like strong coffee, you'll.like fog chaser. Some days I find it a bit too strong, hence the 4 stars. But, I do love the price, what you get for the price, and the fact that it works wit my machine. I like the French roast too, maybe a bit more. It is strong as well."
1,"I like a bolder cup of coffee - not ""Starbucks-bold"" but full bodied and flavorful.  The SF Bay Fog Chaser really fits that bill.  Not over the top strong but very flavorful.  Its great that this product offers competition to the traditional K-cups.  Price is lower but quality is very high.  We've never had an issue fitting this into our Keurig brewer.  The only issue mentioned by many others is the small ""sediment"" in the bottom of each cup."
1,"They come in bags, I think nitrogen sealed. It is enough to last a week each bag.<br /><br />Flavor: Very bold, very strong but not bitter or acidic. Very much like costco coffee<br />but far more flavorful and complex.<br /><br />Can do a full 10 oz and it is still strong with milk.<br /><br />Less plastic to waste"
1,Right amount of caffeine to wake you up.  Flavor and strength are fine too.  I will buy these again as soon as I run out.
1,"I rarely rate things 5 stars, this coffee deserves the top rating. It is incredibly good, I don't think I want a cup of coffee and then I remember these are in the carousel for my Keurig machine, I change my mind in a heartbeat. It's like having a box of your favorite snack in the cupboard and trying to resist eating it, but you know it's there and you keep thinking about it.<br /><br />The flavor of this San Fransisco Bay coffee is rich, complex, and delicious. I can't think of a cup of coffee that I've bought anywhere that can beat the bold, rich flavor of this brand. It's like drinking a glass of fine wine. My favorite k-cup previous to this was Tulley's Kona Blend.<br /><br />The packaging of the individual coffee pod threw me off because when I opened the plastic bag with the pods in it, a very strong aroma of coffee filled the air. I wondered if the paper filter bottoms of the pods wouldn't let the coffee get stale, so I put them in a ziplock baggie. Time will tell I guess if the paper filter will allow the coffee to get stale or not. On the other hand I liked that there was a more green solution to the regular plastic coffee pod holder. I'm torn on this, I 'think' I'd rather have the pods be the more usual plastic in order to preserve freshness, but time will tell. I doubt any of the pods I have will have time to ever get stale however, because I'm drinking them all the time."
1,"I previously purchased a smaller quantity package of this coffee and, liking it as much as I did, I purchased this 80 count package as the price per cup is about 18% less per cup.  This coffee is strong, but not too strong, and good-tasting that not only tastes great but has a nice aroma.<br /><br />The pods are a little different than your traditional plastic K-cup portion as, instead of any plastic around the sides or bottom you have basically a mesh coffee filter holding the coffee grounds. This appears to make a more complete brew, and allows more of the flavor to come into the actual coffee. You will see a dirty residue at the bottom of your cup due to this filtration system vs. a ""clean"" look from a normal K-cup pod. This seems to make sense as the normal K-cup pod has all of the brewed coffee escaping through the pinprick hole vs. the full brewing experience of these pods.<br /><br />As the pods are in this filtration medium the coffee is not air-tight sealed after you open the package of pods. I have put the unused ones in a sealed Ziploc bag to keep them fresh.<br /><br />I also shared this with some folks in the office, who liked it so much they ordered their own so it's not just me who likes this stuff.  I believe I have found a new favorite coffee!"
1,"I was so excited to get my box of Fog Chaser. I had been paying nearly $40 for Starbucks at a wholesale club and only for 40 cups. I had cut myself to one cup per day! Then my friend shared this link and I thought ""Why not!"" It arrived quickly, and smelled heavenly. I like dark, strong coffee, and I could tell by the smell it would fit the bill. The real test is in making it. I brewed it this morning--no grounds in my coffee, and no residue left in my cup. Wondered if the soft filter cup at the bottom would work, and it does. How great is that???? It doesn't taste like instant coffee either, which some imitations do. 80 cups for $33 is an awesome deal...that is around $0.42 a cup. If you buy the little boxes at WalMart you only get 18 for $10..which is around $0.61 per cup...you save $0.19 per cup, which doesn't sound like a lot, but you would spend $50 buying as much at WalMart to get 80 K cups. So you are saving $17. I love it!!! Order yours today, you won't be disappointed."
1,"Thanks to Green Mountain (Keurig) buying up all the K-Cup makers, traditional K-Cups keep getting more and more expensive while getting less and less good.<br /><br />Bad combination.<br /><br />I was almost resigned to buying my own coffee and using the Ekobrew refillable filter until my Keurig gave out but then I came across San Francisco Bay Coffee's Fog Chaser non-K-cups.<br /><br />WOW, I can actually use the large cup setting again!<br /><br />These deceptively little pods pack a punch and while I'm no coffee expert, they are consistent and taste great.<br /><br />Now I'm just hoping that Green Mountain doesn't take them over..."
1,"I am one of those guys that dont like the rising price of k cups. This works great and makes a pretty good<br />cup of coffee. It is very easy to clean up.. just throw away. At the current price of 16.99 it is about .47<br />per cup or .40 with subscribe and safe. I also like saving money using the EKOBREW the refillable k cup filter, when you use that you can put in your own grinds and it costs about .25 for starbucks. This is a little easier when you are finished though and is a Good Value."
1,"These K-Cups arrived promptly after ordering; the are convenient to use, and the coffee tastes great. Highly recommend the product. Have had no problems."
1,"I was at first hesitant due to the 'weird' lack of a normal kcup but other reviewers take on this flavor tempted me. THANK U for tempting me, this flavor is crisp, delicious and downright 'good stuff'.<br />I will definitely reorder over and over, now one of my favs."
1,"I was a bit leary when I ordered this, as it wasn't the traditional K-cup but no need to worry.  It worked just fine.  Only problem is, they don't fit in my K-cup carousel all that well and tend to fall out if I turn it too fast.  Beyond that, the coffee tastes just fine and I LOVE the aroma in the kitchen.  Since they have a kind of mesh/fabric back, the aroma of the coffee comes through.  I HAD to have a cup as soon as they arrived just 'cauze it smelled so good!"
1,I'm pretty much a coffee snob and don't care for most of the choices offered for K-cups.  After trying the San Fracisco Bay French Roast I don't think I'll be able to go back to any of the other K-cups!  It tastes so much fresher than the others and has a rich flavor that beats most gourmet coffee at the high-end shops.  Try it if you like real coffee.
1,"I like more full bodied, strong coffee, but usually find they are too bitter, acidic or taste like burnt grounds. The SF Bay Fogchaser was none of the above. I like the ""cup"" it's a lot less packaging than the normal k-cup (which isn't accepted in our recycling can). With these, I recycle the top and plastic ring and throw the rest into the compost pile. Yes, they look funny, and yes you need to put them into some sort of airtight container to keep them fresh, but a small change for a pretty good cup o' joe."
1,"This product makes a great cup of cofee, bold but not bitter, no bad after taste. The smell starts the experience  and the satisfied full flavor follows. I will buy this product as long as it is available !!"
1,"I am not familiar with other San Francisco Bay Products, but, Fog Chaser will get you moving in the morning.  Definately a dark roast for those of you, like me, who want a quick pick me up in the morning. Yes, I have more than one before going to work. I have tried several different dark roasts & this is in my top 4."
0,"I prefer a stronger bold cup of coffee, which other review promised this brand/type of coffee was, but I found that I had to use the smallest size brew size cup on my keurig to get any flavor at all, therefore using double the pods ( smaller than regular refills)  don't recommend. Too bad because the price is right."
1,"This coffee is outstanding, nice strong flavor without bitterness.<br />I am wondering if these k-cups can be used in a Kreurig Vue?"
1,"THIS COFFEE IS SUCH A GOOD FRAGRANCE AND SOOOO GOOOOOOOOD TASTING! THIS IS WHAT I CALL A CUP A JO! AND SMELLS SO WONDERFUL FROM OPENING THE BAG, TO BREWING IT AND DRINKING IT. GOOD JOB ROGERS FAMILY! THANKS! I WILL BE ORDERING MORE FOR SURE. ANY OF THE K CUPS CAN'T TOUCH THIS! BELIEVE ME BECAUSE WE HAVE TRIED THEM ALL!"
1,"This is definately a fog chaser!  Love this coffee...will continue to purchase.  Of course, I love to visit San Francisco...so this reminds me of that wonderful city!"
1,when your coffee maker motor starts to weaken and sound like a mack truck . Use these the paper filter makes it easy than those plastic ones and the coffee taste great!
1,"I love strong coffee - not bitter - but strong and flavorful.  I grew up in New Orleans and loved the coffee.  I have tried several ""bold"" coffees and find that they are not flavorful at all - just strong (and bitter).  I bought the fog chaser from the local grocery out of pure frustration of not being able to find anything in a K cup to my liking.  Low and behold I LOVE THIS COFFEE.  It is good, strong coffee with a ton of flavor - very smooth.  Those nay-sayers - stick with the mild/medium stuff.  If you want good strong coffee - this is it."
1,"Very good coffee, have had them for a while, like each amount in small bages. this keeps the other frish.<br />I will be buying more, the tast was better than other k-cups. amazon is great."
1,It's a good Coffee but I think it was a little to strong for me.<br />But It does have a nice taste
1,Tastes great and cheaper.. Looks a little different but it is a nice clean design. Pods work very well and fit well also. Have several friends and relatives on the product now and they are very pleased also...<br />Love it
1,"I just poured my first cup of San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-cup Brewers, and it is great! First of all, the Fog Chaser Coffee will do it's job to chase the Fog away: It is REALLY BOLD! I brewed a medium cup because I like bold coffee and was not sure if this brand would deliver. Next time I will not be afraid to brew a large cup. The coffee is rich, flavorful, and did I say Bold?<br /><br />Secondly, I love my Keurig, but hated feeling guilty about all the plastic I was adding to the landfills using the Keurig K-Cups. This pod uses at least 1/3 of the plastic of the standard K-Cup: There is a plastic ring holding the mesh coffee filter pod to the foil cap. Environmentally, this is a step in the right direction. I also feel the design of the pod is what allows the coffee to brew stronger, smoother and with more flavor!<br /><br />My husband does not like his coffee as bold as I do, so I look forward to trying out the other flavors of San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup."
1,Ordered this on Sunday and recieved it on Wednesday. So the shipping was very fast. The cups aren't the usual cups you get from your local store. Looks more like a k pouch. That being said it is good coffee. As soon as I got them I had to try it out. Tasted fresh and brewed very well. I am glad that I have a subscription as this will be a morning regular.
1,"I tried the San Francisco Bay Coffee Fog Chaser since they have reduced the cost & plastic waste by reducing the packaging. I love a good strong cup of coffee and I love my Keurig brewer.  But I am a cheapskate at heart and hated paying the price for the regular K-cups. This is a great compromise.<br />Since it does not have the plastic cup base and is just a round filter hanging from the top ring, you have to keep them sealed in a zip-lock or similar air tight container or they will not stay fresh.  That is a small inconvenience I can live with.  They also reduce our use of plastic and the trash we generate and I suspect that there may be health benefits from not brewing the coffee in the little plastic cup."
1,"This product is fabulous! Delicious coffee, great price, and the packaging uses only a fraction of the plastic used in traditional Kcups."
0,"This coffee is not what I expected.  I thought it would be a bold coffee similiar to Starbucks, but it is not, and it leaves a sediment in my cup, which other don't .  very disappointed and will not re order this brand again."
1,My husband and I are always trying new k-cups to see what's new. We were both pleasantly surprised by this coffee. It was bold but really smooth. It's a great morning and just the right kick for the afternoon pick me up.
1,"I use these in my Keurig B130, they fit well and save plastic. I brew fog chaser over ice- its got a nice medium flavor.<br />The frustration free packaging works fine. I put the opened pods in a ziplock in the freezer- stay fresh for a week."
1,"I have been using a Keurig for about 18 months.  I love the convenience, but feel guilty about wasting the plastic and my husband doesn't like the k-cups cause he says the coffee tastes like plastic.  This brew cup is great...less plastic to waste and the coffee taste fresh!  5 Stars!"
1,"My 5-star rating is in comparison to other K-Cups I've had, not compared to beans just ground and brewed in my Technivorm Moccamaster. Having said that, this is still a satisfying cup of coffee. My wife was drinking Coffee People Donut Shop as her everyday cup, has switched to this. For me the DS was OK, but I favor the darker brews like Paul Newman Extra Bold and the Van Houtte Eclipse. I like this Fog Chaser quite a bit better, and it's a great bonus how much less plastic waste the cups create. On top of that, they're cheaper, so extra bonus. If you like strong, but not bitter, coffee, this is definitely worth trying."
1,"This is great coffee! I can not say enough about how bold and rich this is. I was pleasantly surprised at the richness in the coffee, because I feel like most of the k-cups are kind of weak. This coffee is so good that my husband has declared we will ever buy another brand again. I love the packaging on it as well. I'm not sure if the filters at the bottom instead of the plastic are what help the coffee to taste so good, but it's a great idea! So much less waste and coffee wasn't meant to be streamed through plastic anyway. I wish more k-cups were made this way. We have no problems with the coffee going stale before we get  through the 10 in each package. I store them in the k-cup holder I have and they are still perfect. LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff. Highly recommended!"
0,"This has been running much less than other K cups so I gave it a try.<br /><br />Lower cost than K-cups but more than using an Ekobrew cup with your favorite coffee.<br /><br />Much stronger smell when you open a plastic package.  Not a pleasant coffee smell but some people like that dark a roasting, look at Starbucks.<br /><br />Cons: not very complex, darker almost burnt roasting, some bitterness.<br /><br />If your preferences are more to the Nantucket Blend on the roasting scale this is not for you.<br /><br />Added, I see they have a Breakfast Blend which according to reviews is milder and more complex. However they helpfully point out it is still roasted more than other brands and I believe the amount of roasting is part of my objection to the flavor."
1,"Because of the minimal packaging I didn't expect much or even for the cups to work as well as the usual ones.  I pleasantly surprised at the excellent flavor of the coffee and the way the cups stood up to brewing. This is a very dark roast, not for the timid coffee drinker. It would do well as an iced coffee due to it's rich, bold flavor - hmmmm, not a bad idea, I think I'll try it right now!"
1,"My wife is the coffee drinker in our house. Pete's, Starbucks and a whole host of local coffee spots come under her purview. And then there are all the coffees at the grocery store. She has now deemed Fog Chaser for her Keurig coffee maker the best!"
0,"This was an extremely affordable item, but the old adage you get what you pay for applies here.  The coffee was nothing special and tasted like discount coffee.  One of the best aspects of the single-cup coffee maker is that you get a cup of coffee that is strong (depending upon your preference), fresh and, tastes like a cup of coffee from one of the chain reatil locations, without the retail price. This coffee tasted like weak, old coffee - coffee that was made in a drip maker.  In my opinion, not a ""Fog Chaser"" at all."
1,"I love this coffee.  Great flavor, great price.  I wish I'd found it sooner.  I haven't had the experience with ""stale coffee"" as some of the other reviews state, but I have left the coffee in a ziploc bag instead of in a holder."
1,"Great stuff! Tastes fresher than all of the other types of k-cups; and I've tried all the major ones including Starbucks.<br />It looks like you save ten cents over everyone else as well. The only negative; because of the way they are packed and manufactured, my 30 cup k-cup carousel is now useless."
1,"Coffee People Kona Blend Island Style has been my favorite (prepackaged) coffee for my Keurig.  Fog Chaser may come in a close second.  I started on this one as the Kona hasn't been available for awhile now.  The Fog Chaser is a medium-bodied blend that does well any time of the day.  I like it iced also.  It's smooth with earth and cedar notes.  Not sweet, but not bitter.  A nice balance.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the plastic bags with the air seals on them.  No coffee, no matter if it's whole bean, refrigerated, or in fancy packaging will retain the same flavor profile it had in the first weeks after it's roasted.  Coffee should be drunk in about 2-3 days after it's roasted and for about another 2-4 weeks.  The majority of flavor in coffee comes from it's aromatics, and they are gone in a relatively short period of time.  When I have time I buy green coffee beans, roast them in my air pop popcorn poppers, wait 2-3 days, grind as needed, and drink it all in the next 2-4 weeks.  TMALST  These won't go bad if you leave the bag open on a counter."
1,This coffee is delicious but very strong. Not for the faint of heart...it will wake you up!!!It has a wonderfully rich aroma while brewing and a deep yet not bitter taste. This is a great deal for K-cups and supports an environmentally friendly company. I would wholehearted recommend.
1,"I've really enjoyed this K-cup. The coffee is strong and flavorful and I love that the Cups are recyclable. After I open the package, I put the remaining K-cups in a container in the refrigerator to help keep them fresh."
1,"I almost didn't bother writing this since everything i have to say is covered by others.  Stated simply, it's good coffee, excellent price, with less plastic to go into the trash.  I often run two cycles (one large and one small) using the same ""k-cup"" (not really a k-cup but functions as one) and mix them together. To calibrate my opinion, I'll mention that I am a huge fan of Dunkin Doughnut coffee and I tolerate Starbucks."
1,"Because this Fog Chaser K-Cup makes a very strong regular (a.k.a. SMALL) cup of coffee, it is a great pod for making a larger (travel-sized) cup of coffee that is the perfect strength.  This is absolutely the best deal I've found anywhere online for any K-Cups, and this brand has proven to be of excellent quality as well (I've also ordered French Roast Decaf and was happy with those too!).<br /><br />Because these have a filter-type bottom, you will have to keep them in a sealed bag or container once the individual bag has been opened to keep them at optimal freshness, but this is easy to do and, in my opinion, not a big deal.<br /><br />Great price + great taste = great value.  You can't go wrong with these."
1,This is great stuff.  One of my all time favorites.  If you like strong coffee then you will like this.
1,First time user and found this coffee is very good.  Not too acidy or overly strong.  Good stuff!  I would order again and definately recommend this to others
1,"PLEASE READ!!!!! Do not let the bad reviewers drive you away, I almost didn't order these because of them. If you like REAL coffee not fluffed up flavored coffee but real coffee this is for you. I have tried pretty much every K-cup on the market and the only ones I enjoy are midnight magic and jet fuel. If you like either of these two you will enjoy this cup of coffee. A little about my coffee preference, I mainly enjoy french pressed strong coffees because the flavors are out of this world. I do have a Keurig (Christmas gift) for about 5 years now, sad part is I only use this if I ran out of time in the morning. With all of that said do realize this is not even remotely close to a french press but is now being added to my very small k-cup approval list."
1,"What I really like about this K-Cup is that it is not a normal K-Cup encased in plastic. The coffee is enclosed in a filter, which results in less plastic in the landfills. In addition, the coffee itself is a nice strong cup worthy of it's name, Fog Chaser. It is my favorite cup of coffee in the morning. I have made it a point to subscribe and have it delivered every month."
1,"Though it may not be the BEST coffee I've ever tasted, it's pretty up there, and for a price that's a fraction of the other K-cups, it's 5-stars in my book.  I get an 80-pack box from my local BJ's for $28, so it works out to be $.35/k-cup.  It's much more rich and flavorful than other k-cups I've tried (donut shop, green mountain, gloria jean's)."
1,"I first bought this at a local grocery and liked it so much I went to amazon to purchase it on an automatic delivery.  It has a different packaging than most, but it works the same.  The pricing is much better than purchasing either in the store or online individually.  This is my first auto delivery from amazon.  I am very pleased with the coffee and the shipping process."
1,"This is a great coffee, very strong and tasty, not just bitter and bold.<br /><br />The lack of a plastic cup at the bottom is neat, reduces waste significantly."
1,"Count me among the fans. I love the lower-waste design of these k-cup compatible pods. It is a mild inconvenience keeping them in an airtight container, but the investment in a tight-sealing jar paid for itself with the first case. It was smart to package them in bags of 12, so each bag is only open for about a week.  The coffee is good. Not astonishingly strong, but pretty rich and balanced. They don't advertise it here, but the company's coffee is fair trade/direct trade as well!"
1,"A friend offered me a cup of this about a week ago. Wonderful stuff! Disappointing when he told me, it's not in stores. (At least not around here, so I have to order on Amazon...) It's great tasting coffee!  And more importantly, even though it brews in the Keurig, it's NOT in little plastic cups.<br />More than two years ago I switched to the oh-so-convenient K-Cups, despite reservations about brewing coffee in little plastic cups. (1)Very hot water steeps in Plastic cups. (2)Lots of little plastic cups go into landfills or incinerators.  Now, finally, there's a product with all the convenience of the K-cup brewers, but none of the drawbacks!  Why didn't someone think of this sooner?"
1,"I really like this coffee. It's bold, yet smooth as well. I especially appreciate the simpler packaging with much less plastic waste. Additionally, I don't think the coffee grounds touch plastic at all, just the foil top and filter. They work impeccably in my Keurig."
1,"Our family really likes this brand of coffee.  The package the coffee by the dozen in plastic bags to ensure freshness and the taste is a mild to medium flavor.  The subscribe and save is a great way to save money (around fourteen dollars for thirty six cups) and ensure you're never without coffee.  Although it's still wasteful, each cup has less plastic than the regular k-cup coffees out there.  I actually like that you can see the coffee and the little filter pouch it sits in.  We recently found out that costco is selling this brand of coffee (french roast - which is much more bold) for a more economical price (eighty cups for around thirty six cents a piece).  We will continue to purchase and suggest you try it out at least once."
1,I like a bolder coffee than my husband does and this one is good enough for me. It leaves a pleasant after-flavor. I am impressed also with the design of the cups. I'd certainly order it again.
0,"It was much too ""sharp/harsh"" for me.  Had to add cinnamon and half-and-half just to get it down.  Really sorry I purchased two boxes of it!"
0,"I purchased this because another reviewer likened it to Coffee People's Jet Fuel.  Unfortunately it is not even close.<br />The first cup seemed fine. The flavor immediately after brewing is good, but as soon as it cools down some it turns harsh fast.<br />The open-filter is a poor design. It can and absolutely will go stale.  I compared the scent of the final coffee pouch(cup?) from a previously opened bag to a newly opened, and the scent is completely different. Think old coffee can vs. freshly opened.<br />The other gripe on the filter is the poor filtration. There is always sediment at the bottom of the cup.<br /><br />About me: I am very picky about my coffee. I drink it straight black and brew at 8oz with double filtered water in a Cuisinart Keurig coffee maker.  I don't reuse k-cups!<br />My favorite coffees are Coffee People's Black Tiger and Jet Fuel, Caribou's Mahogany and Van Houtte's Eclipse."
1,"Both my wife and I like this coffee.  one brew per cup for her is how she likes.  I brew a cup 1-1/2 times to get the flavor I like.  Very good price.  If there is a down side it would be the container is not your typical k-kup, rather a round filter at the bottom holding the coffee.  It works fine in the Keurig and we keep ours unused in an air tight container to keep fresh"
1,"Love this coffee - when it first arrived I thought I had ordered the wrong thing as the ""pods"" are quite different from regular K-cups, but they work perfectly and I think the coffee tastes much better than the coffee in the plastic pods.  The Fog Chaser is a nice, not-too-strong, coffee, perfect for that first wake up cup in the morning."
1,"From the moment I cut open the sealed bag containing the coffee pods, I could appreciate the quality of this coffee, as the wonderful aroma enveloped my senses.  The coffee taste only bolstered my appreciation, as the flavor was rich and delicious.  Highly recommended!  (Note: I have no connection with this company... just a happy customer)"
1,"Love these k-cups, bold flavor similar to Jet Fuel or Big Easy with less of a French roast flavor.  I can actually get a 12 Oz. cup and still have good flavor."
1,wonderful full bodied coffee and a great price; much less 'offensive' packaging than a normal K-cup; works just like a normal K-cup; no problems.
1,"""Fog Chaser""...a great description! Extremely fresh. The taste is surprisingly deep and rich for a medium roast, or ""Full City."" I usually drink a darker roast just to get the extra bit of flavor, but this one is even better than San Francisco Bay's French Roast. The only other coffees that come close are <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006Q822L0"">Brooklyn Bean Roastery ""Fuhgeddaboudit""</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006Q82652"">""Cyclone,""</a> two of my other favorites, along with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006N3I5DM"">Green Mountain Revv</a>.<br /><br />Keep in mind that these are ""pods"" rather than actual k-cups, so after you open the bag, you will need to seal the unused capsules in a zip bag, preferably in the refrigerator (not the freezer). Doing this, I've never had the coffee go stale. If you like deep, flavorful coffee, I recommend you give this one a try."
1,The design of these pods are so much better than the Kcups.  Give a full bodied rich cup of delicious coffee.<br />Wish there were more flavor options in this packaging.  Fantastic!!
1,"Good option for K-Cup coffee makers.  The filter pod fits right into the machine and brews a great cup of coffee with less plastic waste.  The packaging allows a pretty good price point, but for a stronger better tasting coffee  (you know the one named after the actor) I will stay with club stores 80 pack for $39, keeping the coffee price just below that 50c mark."
1,"No sediment, just great tasting (and smelling) coffee.  Tired of Emeril's constant price changes and packaging changes.  This is as hearty as Emeril and as smooth with less waste to Mother Earth and much less money.  Very impressed, been using Keurig for over 5 years and this coffee is great."
1,"I am not big on posting reviews but this coffee is awesome!  The aroma when you open the bag, the smell while it is brewing, I just cant say enough good about this coffee!!  Yes is it not the same K-Cup we are used to seeing - so what!!!  It works great and I will just store them in a canister - it is worth it for a good strong cup of coffee.  Something, in my opinion, that has been missing from K-cup selections.  Hope this review helps!!"
1,"After living in Europe for 6 years, I have become very picky about coffee.  I am not a ""coffee snob""...I can't tell what aroma a coffee may or may not have; I can just taste the difference between good and bad coffee.  Don't be fooled by the price of this coffee or the different looking k-cup; this coffee is top-notch.  If you like good coffee, this is worth a try.<br /><br />****EDIT****<br /><br />I thought about writing a long rant, about how the negative reviewers of this coffee, don't know what good coffee taste like, but I thought twice.  They just like a different taste to their coffee.  So instead, if you like Folgers, Maxwell House, Green Mountain, The Coffee People, etc., you will probably not like this coffee.  The people who will like this, should know who they are, by my previous comment.  I did find a couple of varieties of coffee from the same manufacture I did somewhat enjoy; Coffee People - Black Tiger, Green Mountain - Black Magic and Sumatran Reserve, although I did not like it enough, to purchase them again.<br /><br />Here is a list of coffee I really enjoy and come in K-Cups.<br />Caribou Mahogany, Starbucks Sumatra and Pikes Place."
1,Thses cooffee pods are extra nice because there is much less plastic and work just as well.  The flovor is nice and bold without being bitter.  I have re-ordered and will continue to do so.
1,"Very smooth with no aftertaste, slightly bold. I use a medium size setting, I think 7 1/4 oz. on my maker. It seems necessary to store them in an airtight container after opening, to keep fresh. One of my current favorites."
1,"I stumbled upon this coffee while browsing Amazon and was instantly interested because of the price and when I looked further I saw that it had much less plastic.  I decided to try it.  It is sooo  good.  I can see this being my new favorite coffee.  I will have to see how it stores.  I do like that there are 3- 12 packs so I only have to open 12 pods at once.  I'll store them in tupperware or something but I can't imagine it will be much of a problem.  It really really is a wonderful, strong, flavorful cup of coffee.  Thank you SF Bay Coffee."
1,Great coffe! Ordered the French roast to see if it is as good. The pod design is very good.<br />Enjoy!
1,"This is one that truly seems to depend on your taste in coffee.  I served it to five people at the office because I personally love it.  Two of them said they couldn't finish the cup, while the other three thought it was the best they've had. I personally like the more traditional taste of brewed coffee that this product produces.  The plastic k-cups always seemed to have an awkward taste to them, almost as if I wasn't really drinking coffee.  I do get a small amount of sediment in the bottom of the cup, but also don't mind that.  Since it does turn the inside of my white cup pretty black, I suppose I should also start thinking about what it's doing to my teeth and my insides, but the flavor seems to make it all worthwhile anyhow.  At the office it was clearly a love it or hate it type reaction - this from four people who usually choose a bold coffee and one who always drinks light (but happened to love this)."
1,"After buying the SFB French Roast K-Cups, I thought I would give the Fog Chaser a chance.  Wow!  What a good and strong cup of coffee.  Stronger than the French Roast.  I will keep buying these!<br /><br />Just an update:  Recently I found k-cups on sale and bought a box of what used to be my favorite.  After brewing the coffee and drinking it, I realized, I did not like it!  The SF Fog Chaser is superior to the k-cups offered.  Will not go back to the regular k-cups again."
1,makes a good cup of coffee at a reasonable cost. not a true k-cup but works well in a keurig.
1,"I stumbled across this coffee, and I'm so glad I did !!!  Just received it today, was curious so I made a cup.  Great flavor, a bit bold, but very smooth.  I think my husband will love it tomorrow morning.  Signed up for the auto shipments, which takes the price a bit lower and I don't have to place an order every month.  Great product and love the auto ship !!!!"
1,"I was a bit skeptical when I saw to alternative to the original K-Cup,  I tried the Fog Chaser and have to say it is a great product.  Good balanced flavor and strong too.  I usually buy coffee by the case at Costco but this is a superior option.  Less plastic also makes them more ecologically friendly and potentially recyclable.  Two Thumbs Up!"
1,I am so glad I read the reviews on this coffee product.  The cups fit the Keurig very well and make a tasty cup of coffee!  I like the fact that there is no plastic base to it (less plastic in the trash).  I will buy it again and again.  My favorite coffee thus far.  I have subscribed to this so it will be shipped automatically every month.
1,"Fog Chaser is a pleasant tasting cup of coffee. I like the more environmentally friendly cup/pod design, but since it comes twelve in a plastic bag, I don't know if it is a net eco-plus. I also can buy it at Wegman's for much less than from Amazon."
1,"This is a great full bodied coffee. I have tasted different brands and have a few I would call favorites, this is one. The design of the K-Cup without the plastic cup at the bottom is very different but you don't even miss it. You will love the taste of this coffee.<br />I haven't tried the other flavors San Francisco Bay puts out but I'm tempted."
1,good coffee not to strong not to weak enjoyed very much will continue to order this brand of coffee in the future. Thanks so much
1,"Another manufacturer recently discontinued my favorite k-cup and I have been searching for a replacement - Fog Chaser is my choice - robust and flavorful, it is best consumed black - it certain chases the fog of sleep and and helps to get my days started."
1,"Hands down, this coffee is the best K-cup compatible product available..  Filter system is superior to K-Cup, much of the natural coffee oils actually make it into your cup.....  HIGHLY RECOMMEND - subscribe and save a +"
1,"Bravo for the new Eco Friendly Pod.  I actually forgot what fresh, real coffee tastes like.  At first I was taking back but the strong, robust flavor.  Then after a few sniffs and sips I felt rejuvenated.  For the first time since I got my Keurig I realized that I missed fresh brewed coffee.  The taste is so fresh, so lively, so good.  The price is also an added bonus.  This Crazy Coffee Mom is really hooked."
1,"Just recieved this coffe for the first time. San Francisco Bay ""Fog Chaser"", I like a bold coffee and this one delivers...great balance flavor and this cup design works great! With so much less waste and the price is outstanding! Thanks San Francisco Coffee Co."
1,"These ""cups"" have a little filter at the bottom instead if a plastic cup which allows for less waste in the trash can, yeah!! I always felt kind of guilty putting so many plastic cups in the garbage. Now to the coffee it is absolutely the best I have had.  A 10oz cup is possible without tasting too watery, especially with the French roast.  Every one of the Rogers family cups are great.  The fog chaser is a little smoother than the french roast but nice and dark.  The french roast is great also not quite as bitter as the usual french roast even the decaf is great.  This coffee rivals fresh brewed easily and is less expensive which is a bonus for those of us who want the freedom of K cups but don't like the price.  I will buy this brand from now on, I am a loyal customer of this Old San Francisco Bay Coffee.  Rogers family thanks for bringing real coffee to Keurig."
1,"OK, I know there are over 200 reviews, but I just had to add my two cents. THis is by far THE BEST approach to this one cup (kcup) system. Not dispensing with the pod system, which is slightly less toxic to the environment. Ok, so without a doubt a step in the right direction on the kcup systems; but the coffee....WOW..this stuff hits your nose when you open the bag and keeps hitting it each time I open the zip lock I put them into, after opening the original ( slight dig on the company for not making a resealable bag..come on man!  Anyway, can't say enough about the coffee, I have tried just about every bold, dark, espresso, medium roast, you name it, and this one is my favorite so far.<br />I may have to buy some beans or grounds to use to make my own.<br /><br />Thanks!"
1,I really like the idea of the large filter on the bottom.  I hate when one of my K-cups would not work correctly and leak everywhere but this design prevents that. The coffee tastes great with no bitter after taste. I will be buying this again!
1,"This coffee is a good selection if you like a dark, full-bodied brew to chase the fog, and dislike the waste inherent with the convenience of a Keurig K-cup brewer. Works great, less material waste and less packaging waste. I do think it is a good idea to keep them in a sealed container, but an old coffee can works great."
1,"The flavor of the the Fog Chaser is pretty good. Bold, yet not ""too"" strong.<br />The cup design seems to work/brew okay, just maybe allows for a small amount of ""fines"" to sneak into the coffee cup.<br />The price is attractive and makes it a ""re-buy"" if I'm running low on Coffee People Donut Shop...<br />These need to be kept in a air tight container. I use a zip baggie."
1,"This is a great idea to reduce packaging and works great on the kuerig brewer.  The coffee was wonderful, and the price was much better than the regular k-cups. I would love to see them come in flavored coffee also."
1,"When I ordered this coffee, I hoped the majority of the reviews were correct, and they were. I am really happy with Fog Chaser. I've bounced around through all the Keurig dark roasts and in my opinion, this is better than all of them. The aroma and taste far surpass any K-cup I've ever had. I store the coffee in an air-tight container, and have had no problems with freshness. They work perfectly in my B70 brewer, and I do wash the K-cup holder every couple of days or so because these have a real filter instead of plastic. The price is great, especially with Subscribe and Save - never going back to plastic K-Cups!"
1,This is some great coffee. My wife likes it too. It has a good blend of flavors and isn't too bitter. I'll keep ordering it.
1,"A perfect blend, and a good bargain.  The coffee ""pod"" cups fit perfectly in the Keurig.  I bought this coffee for my husband who is a fussy coffee drinker.  He loves it!"
1,"This was a new item for me, believe me I have tried them all. The new type of K-cup is great! It lets the coffee drain much better.  I am ordering more...Thanks San Francisco Bay Coffee for your new way of packaging."
1,Great coffee flavor.  Great price!  Like this method.  Use coffee canister to store once open package.  I use the subscription for an even better price.
1,"This was a new brand for our Keurig, so I did not know what to expect. I was surprised with no ""k-cup"" - but this works very well and seems ""greener."" Tastes great."
1,"I like coffee but I don't have a palate that can differentiate between a coffee with subtle hints of vanilla, grass and one with ""smokiness."" I just know whether I like it or not. To me there's two kinds of coffee, the smooth kind and the kind that has a bite.<br /><br />I feel like Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts have a bite to them, something that makes them different. This Fog Chaser coffee is like that. There's something about it that makes it different and I think it's really good!<br /><br />The cups are not your normal K cup so I just got a metal tin and put them in there to keep them fresh.<br /><br />If you do the subscribe and save on amazon, it makes these cups very affordable (for k cups).<br /><br />Overall, very good coffee."
1,"Bold taste, but the roast isn't too strong.  This is a nice, every-day cup.  Brews well in Keurig.  I also bought the Rainforest and French Roast (which I love)."
1,"Coffee has a very good taste, is not bitter and has a pleasant aroma. The only problem I have with it is it comes in a fiber womb, not plastic like most other K-Cups. And sometimes it allows the coffee sediment to leak through. It doesn't happen all the time, found to be about 20-25% of the time. Also you have to place cups in a zip lock baggie to keep fresh, after you open Mfg's.bag. If it weren't for this I would have given it 5 Stars."
1,"First of all, the coffee is quite rich, and definitely appropriately labeled Fog Chaser!  Non bitter, smooth bold medium-dark roast.  It is one of my personal favorites.  But the purchaser should be aware of how this coffee is packaged. It works great in the Keurig machines but the packaging is not a true K-cup.  A K-cup, as designed (and probably patented), is a small plastic cup sealed with a foil lid, under which is a coffee filter pouch of a single serving of coffee.  The packaging on this does not have the plastic cup encasing the foil lid and filter paper pouch of coffee.  I suspect the manufacturer is saving in paying licensing fees from using the K-Cup design by excluding the cup.  But you have to use different storage containers for these packages, as using the usual racks and other means of storing K-Cups will allow air to get to the coffee and cause it to go stale unless stored in an air-tight container or plastic bag.  Also, this packaging may not work in Keurig brewers that automatically dispose of the spent K-Cups.  Another slight inconvenience is that the brewed package leaves a wet coffee filter sack of coffee grounds, whereas with a genuine K-Cup, the spent package only has one small hole in the bottom of the plastic cup, the rest of the package is dry upon disposal handling."
1,"The moment I opened the bag I knew this was going to be good.  The Aroma was FANTASTIC.<br />I have this in my office at work and several other people have had a ""wow"" reaction to the aroma."
1,"I am very surprised that the biggest secret about San Francisco Bay single service coffee , which works perfectly in famous brand K-Cup makers, has not been revealed in any of the previous comments.  Or at least I did not find the secret yet revealed.  I love Amazon.com and am a high volume customer but folks, you can get this product at COSTCO at a significant savings.  An 80 count box at COSTCO is just around $30; unit cost is about 34 cents.  Do not hesitate because of the 80 count box.  The contents are packed 8 units to a heavy duty sealed nitrogen filled bag that will hold for over a year.  You will find the 'good until' date clearly printed on each bag.  When you cut open the bag (you will need scissors) the phenomenal fragrance of freshly ground French Roast coffee comes right at you.  If you like that rich smell of fresh ground, this will be almost as good as when you drink it after brewing.<br /><br />So is this a good coffee?  I am an old restaurant guy and I always prefer my coffee rich, dark and not bitter.  I tried virtually all the K-cup samplers available so I could do a comparison of the DARKS, BOLDS and FRENCH ROASTS I could find.  Other than a few Sumatra brews, this SF BAY product stood out at the top of the list.  That even includes the really expensive stuff that is good but not good enough to be price competitive or flavor superior. If you do not at least try this coffee in your K-Cup brewer, you are missing a unique opportunity for quality and value.  If you shop at COSTCO, you need to look for it and get the best competitive single serve French Roast around town.  You will also find that San Francisco Bay bulk coffees have been sold at COSTCO for a very long time.<br /><br />Now, about that little filter material container in place of the plastic cup you are used to seeing.  Well, the Rodgers Family who produce all the San Francisco Bay Coffees (and other labels), are independent and want us all to get their premium coffees without having to pay the Royalties to use the ""K-Cup"" brand name...and they do not want to infringe on copyright designs, so they were inspired to have this design created.  The entire container portion of the unit is indeed a filter and allows for the best extraction methodology.<br /><br />You must be asking yourself if I am a ""shill"" for this company and the answer is an emphatic NO.  I am just a life long student of consumer economics and I really like to give credit when and where it is earned.  The Rodgers family business is located in Lincoln, California in the vicinity of where I live - and I also like to support my local business.<br /><br />You may forget all about what I have said here, but you will always remember San Francisco Bay French Roast once you have tasted it."
1,"Like others here I am always on the lookout for a K-Cup bargain. With such an attractive price I finally decided to give San Francisco Bay's Fog Chaser a chance. I was a little worried about the unique design of these cups. However, after receiving them and brewing a couple of cups of coffee I can say that there was no need to worry. I would describe this coffee as Medium roast, maybe leaning towards dark. It has a nice distinctive flavor, and the Amazon Frustration Free packaging really is frustration free. We store our open cups in a sealed container to help maintain freshness. All in all a good cup of coffee, and as long as the price remains competitive I will be a repeat customer."
1,"I'm thrilled that we can now purchase less expensive K-cups.<br />Keurig was definitely getting too expensive for me.<br />I tried the Fog Chaser, it was good, clean-tasting coffee but not as strong<br />as I thought it should be. And the free shipping from Amazon makes it<br />more appealable.  Will be purchasing again."
1,"What a surprise when I got home from the grocery store and opened this package to find cups that really look nothing like the ones you are used to.  I was a little worried when I saw that instead of all plastic, this actually is made out of very little plastic and the coffee is actually held in material just like regular coffee filters.  I love that they are not as destructive to the environment as the others.  The company really believes in freshness since they put these little pod/pouches in a sealed pouch and then stick them in the cardboard.<br /><br />Now mind you I am truly wedded to my Green Mountain Dark Magic, but I decided to try this because of the price.  And I'm not one bit sorry I did, I feel a tad guilty for semi-abandoning my Green Mountain! This Fogchaser blend  makes a good strong  cup of coffee without giving me the  feeling that the lining of my stomach is going to burn out.<br /><br />I'm thrilled to see that I now have an alternative to Green Mountain and I can even save money since it is at least 3 dollars cheaper (at least in my grocery store) a package."
1,"Decided to give this a try since k-cup (all coffee?) prices have been going up.  Brewed with the large mug (not tumbler) size on my Keurig B70.  It isn't as dark as Peet's from my ekobrew adapter, but that might be because Peet's does a darker roast.  Stronger than Green Mtn Colombian.  Maybe about the same as Dark Magic.<br /><br />Coworkers agreed that we'll probably buy more since we don't have to do any coupons from other vendors to get good coffee at this price."
1,"5:45 a.m. The alarm just went off. You want to be on the road before 7. You find the kitchen, get out the kettle and start the water boiling. Get out the Boodum, fill it up. Wait. Water boils. Pour it in the press. Wait.  Wait more. Can't wait any longer. Push plunger, drink, coffee is weak, pillow starts calling your name, you lose the will to shower, next thing you know, it's 8:15 and you're praying for the grid to melt down.<br /><br />OR, you get up at 5:45 a.m., drop a K-Cup in your Keurig, push a button and your cup runneth over (especially if you accidentally pushed the button with the picture of the mug on it).  And if it's San Francisco Bay Fog Cutter, you also get a deliciously rich, full-bodied, fragrant brew that is acid free and gentle on an early morning tummy.  Best of all, you can drink your Fog Cutter while waiting for the stuff in the Boodum Coffee Press to be ready. Now you can face the shower, the hair dryer, the curling iron and the eyelash curler without fear.<br /><br />I prefer the Boodum to the Keurig, but when you need coffee now, this blend can't be beat.  It's the best of all the K-Cup offerings that I've tried, and I've tried everything from Donut Shop to Newman's Own and most points in between.  It is my early morning wake up favorite.<br /><br />I was very amused, not to say impressed, by one reviewers comments about the packaging  He notes that there is a drawing of a K-Cup type machine on the front of the box and a list of various K-Cup brewers that will accommodate this version of the K-Cup.  He points out that the San Francisco Bay Coffee supports many environmental projects, as noted on the top of the box, which also shows photos of these worthy projects.  The Rodgers Family, who own the company, are shown in a family photo on one side flap, along with an essay on the company's values.  The other flap has a description of the actual coffee.  This guy is a whiz in the a.m.  I'm happy if I find the sink on the first try.<br /><br />Anyway, this is the best pre-coffee coffee I've ever had. And it's an excellent main course coffee too.<br /><br />Enjoy."
1,"This variety is strong and bold!  The price is reasonable as it is.  But, if you want to stretch your K-cup value even more, you can make 2 cups from one K-cup.  I brew a medium and a small cup into my large coffee cup.  And, it's still a strong cup of coffee!  I like this so much that I signed up for subscribe and save!"
1,"I generally like the stronger coffees.  A lot of the k-cups have been very weak and flavorless.  I have nearly finished my first order of the Fog Chaser and it is one of the better coffees I've had for the Keurig.  The k-cups are little different than the traditional plastic cups, but who cares?  And I can't figure out what ""smell"" other reviewers are talking about.  When you open a bag, it smells like ground COFFEE.  Uh, that is not a bad thing.  It is because the cups are made of a breathable filter pouch.  What does a box of regular K-cups smell like?  Plastic cups?<br />Each twelve comes in its own sealed plastic bag so I am not worried about them going stale unless it takes you a couple months to drink 12 cups.  And the price is much lower than most of the of the other brands.  I can't see spending 1 1/2 to 2 times as much for coffee that is either not as good or at best just as good.  I singed up for the subscribe and save to get it delivered regularly so I dont run out.  I just hope others find it as great tasting as I do so amazon keeps carrying it!"
1,"I wish I didn't feel like I have to give this product a low rating, but I wouldn't buy it again without some changes.  It's really delicious coffee -- bold and flavorful, without the mouth-puckering acidity of some of the coffee I've tried.  The flavor changes as it cools, too.  Most delightful.<br /><br />However.  The first time I used one it really made a mess.  I had to clean coffee grounds out of the brewing doohickey on the Keurig (which I hate doing because it's tedious), and there was quite a bit of sediment in my cup, too.  It's exactly the same thing that happens with my reusable k-cup.  I was trying to find an alternative to that, and to contributing so many of those little plastic planet-polluter K-cups to the landfill.  (We drink a lot of coffee.)<br /><br />If the company could find a way to keep that from happening -- a coarser grind, maybe? -- I'd for sure try this again.  I can use the remaining pods, though. They'll be handy for traveling with. I tried opening one and brewing the coffee in my Aeropress and they're just right for that.<br /><br />And then, later on...<br />I had to come back and update this review.  We ran out of Kcups, and I dug these out of the cupboard in desperation.  My husband likes them so much that I'm ordering more, messy or not.  BTW, he said he considers the sediment minimal, and not much of an issue at all."
1,"After having the conventional plastic packaged k cup brand coffees this was a very eco-friendly and satisfying alternative.  I have tried each of the Rogers family flavors and find them all aromatic and good tasting.  Only one downfall, as they cannot be stored in my countertop carousel.  This flavorful coffee is well worth the inconvenience of having to store the unused cups in an air tight container.  Who would think that such an economical coffee could taste so good."
1,"After reading the reviews that indicated a non-traditional k-cup packaging, I was a little leery-- but the packaging works well in my coffee maker and leaves no residue in the cup. The coffee is delicious-- I tend to prefer strong blends and this is satisfying. Good product, good price."
1,I have owned a Keurig for about 2 years now and this is by far the tastiest cup of coffee I've had and I've tried LOTS. I love the little paper filter as opposed to the full plastic jacket of most K-cups. It's a keeper!
1,"These brilliant K-cups have about 10-20% of the plastic of a normal K-cup.  A persistent criticism of K-Cups in the press is the amount of plastic that winds up in the landfill.  We all know (and love) the ease of popping in a cup, pressing the brew button, and tossing the cup afterwards.  So easy!  However I've always felt guilty about the waste, as normally I compost coffee grounds and of course there is no plastic associated with a paper coffee filter.  You can buy refillable K-cups but none of them fit my B30 apparently and anyway the convenience factor diminishes greatly.  These work in my B30 perfectly.  It's hard for me to judge the taste - I add milk and sugar - but the bouquet is pleasing."
1,"Function: these cupless k-cups work perfectly in our Keurig B130 (the business version of the small personal brewer).<br /><br />Less waste: I was terribly disappointed when I discovered that the plastic k-cups aren't recyclable.  These are a terrific low-guilt, more responsible alternative.<br /><br />Less storage space: they take up much less room to store.  I buy my k-cups in quantity to save money, but then I had to dedicate a large cabinet to storing them!  Not so with these, partially because they're less bulky and partially because...<br /><br />Great Price: these k-cups are much less expensive than other brands, especially at the Subscribe & Save price.  At this price, I can buy less at a time and still pay way less per cup than I could finagle with coupons & sales & bargain-shopping the major brands.<br /><br />Taste: Ok, obviously this is the most important factor...and so as soon as they arrived I threw one in and...hurray, they're tasty!  Fog Chaser is a slightly less strong taste than I usually drink, but I find it pleasant & smooth & complex in flavor.  It tastes like it smells, which is very nice.<br /><br />Conclusion: I'm keeping my subscription.  How can you beat cheap, tasty, less bulky, and less waste?  You really can have it all.<br /><br />Update a month later: this roast has really grown on me!"
1,"This coffee has a wonderful flavor.  It is very aromatic.  I love this coffee and the price!  I love my Keurig, but k cups are spendy.  This product is perfect."
1,"Wow! When I first tried this coffee my response was ""That's way too strong""! And yet, after getting into the 2nd cup, I found that I am starting to enjoy real coffee again. Definitely the big favorite in our house, and highly recommended. Also, a little less plastic in the landfill, so that's a plus."
1,"I purchased the Fogchaser Kcups and really enjoyed the strong earthy taste. The coffee tastes like ""organic"" grown beans. I stopped buying Kcups because I just wasn't getting the caffeine kick that I demand from my coffee. San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser coffee is the only Kcup coffee I have ever purchased that actually tastes like strong black coffee as opposed to the usual Kcup brew of hot colored water.<br /><br />I will definitely keep my ""Subscribe and Save"" order for SFB Fog Chaser coffee."
1,Coffee is excellent.  The K-Cup is different in that a filter is at the bottom and really provides a great taste.  Set up a subscription and you can not beat the quality and price!
1,"I have been having trouble with my small Keurig with the regular kcups.  (this is the smallest Mr Coffee made by Keurig and is brand new), but it would only brew half a cup and sometimes the pressure would rupture the seal on the k cup and grounds would overflow...I bought the San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser and not only is the taste awesome...but my keurig loves them...I think the filter bottom vs, the plastic cup allows the water to flow thru better and I get a full cup every time and no more mess!  I was going to return the Keurig and try something different...Not now!  Mr. Coffee Single Serve Powered by Keurig Brewing Technology"
1,"I received a Keurig machine as a gift for my birthday and had been using the regular run of the mill products that were available.  Then low and behold I found the San Francisco Bay brand of one cup brewing pods and you could not pay to stop using them!  By far the best cup of coffee ever, every single time!"
1,"Life is hectic and it's the small things that matter.  A fresh start to each day with a cup of great coffee!  The personalized product of the one cup San Francisco Bay is AMAZING!  The depth, aroma, flavor, color are far superior to others on the market.  Great quality, great price, great cup of coffee-"
0,"I really liked this coffee, but it will not be on my list of coffees to buy again because of the one major flaw.  It comes in a sealed bag and when you open it, the aroma is tantalizing.  Too bad it is so short lived.  Unless you are going to drink 12 cups of coffee, or have a bigger family who will in one day, that is the last fresh cup you will get.  There is no bottom to this K-cup except what would be around a pod of coffee so the air destroys it quickly.  After I took out the few we would need for breakfast, I sealed the unused ""k-cups"" in a plastic bag, but for the next couple mornings when I got some out, the aroma had faded more and more.  I love the way the original K-cups stay fresh until you use them, and these are not like that.  I also didn't like how I couldn't put them in my carousel of other K-cups.  Kind of a pain to have them sealed in the cupboard until I wanted them.  Don't get me wrong, the coffee was excellent when we first opened the package, but the quality diminished quickly.  If you are one of those people who drinks the same kind of coffee every morning and have several people drinking it, this may work for you.  I like to have variety in the morning whether it be Jet Fuel or Italian roast according to how I feel that day so these won't be purchased by me again."
1,"I like strong coffee and this coffee taste very good even when brewed on the big/travel mug setting. It's flavorful, not burnt tasting, and has a good kick. And to me represents a standout value in the world of Keurig choices. Do the math, especially with Subscribe and Save. I know some folks complain about them losing freshness... I just transfer them to a ziplock bag upon opening the package. Not a big deal and I don't sense I've lost freshness.<br /><br />I'd dock them half a star for the bag-to-bag transfer  (here's an idea: package them with a zipper, like cold cuts!) but it still rounds up to 5 stars. :-)"
1,I have purchased these k-cup/pods a couple of times.  They brew a nice strong cup of coffee.  Bold flavor without bitterness.  These pods work great in my Keurig.  They brew a great clean cup of coffee.  I haven't had a problem with freshness because I go through a twelve pack in a few days.  If you want a flavorful and bold cup of coffee give Fog Chaser a try.
0,"I at first thought I ordered the wrong product, and had to go back and check. This defeats much of the purpose of a K-Cup, having a sealed package with nitrogen gas to keep it fresh until ready to use. When I opened the bag, it was a great smell, as all the aroma escaped into the atmosphere!<br />Know how do you keep the rest fresh? Opening and closing a zip lock isn't going to cut it, as air gets in each time.<br />Also, without the cup, I don't think the coffee gets a chance to 'seep' long enough, as it seems a bit weak for something called Fog Cutter.<br />Think I'll avoid this one in the future."
0,"I picked this up at a Fresh & Easy.  While I like the idea of more choices than the officially licensed K-Cups, this is just not a good coffee.  It tastes bitter and bland.  Not recommended.  Try Millstone's Fogchaser K-Cups instead."
1,Outstanding Cup of Coffee!  I have tried at least 20-25 different K-Cups for the Keurig Brewer.I highly recommend this one!  The aroma of the coffee in the K-Cup was fresh and smelled like the beans had just been ground. The flavor was not bitter or too strong.  I am impressed and now a fan of the San Francisco Bay Coffee makers. I also tried the French Roast and loved it as well. I appreciate other AMAZON users posting their reviews or I would never have tried it.
1,Excellent coffee and one of the best Keurig cup bargains there is I will buy more of this product and no plastic bottoms
1,"Loving the Greenmountain Nantucket K-cup .  I like a variety of coffee.  Love trying new<br />but Regular types of coffees.  I found this to be a nice cup of coffee.  Not Acidic at all.<br />Some people are Starbuck lovers , some poeple are Dunkin Donut coffee Lovers.  Im<br />a Dunkin Donut coffee lover.  This coffee was enjoyable to both me and my husband.  Would<br />defintely order again.  We love that it has less plastic on the actually pod/k-cup to save<br />the earth.  The downside is that it doesnt fit in our k-cup  stand.  I actually store<br />them in a ziplock to keep there freshness.  Would be nice if the company when they sold<br />it had it in a ziploc bag atleast as we had to transfer it to one ours.  Other then that.<br />Great Taste,"
1,"I am so happy that I found this coffee. I have been using a Keurig for years now, and tried many of the single use cups on the market. I have even used the cups that you fill with your own coffee, but nothing compares to this San Francisco Bay coffee! And can you beat the price? Love the coffee, love the price and love the convenience of the 80 count box."
1,This coffee is at least as good as any of the actual Keurig K-cups at a much lower price. I will definitely order it again!
1,"Excellent packaging, aroma, taste and delivery.  A little too bold for my husband's taste (he likes a lighter coffee), so I am not going to hesitate to try the breakfast blend next time."
1,"I actually stopped using my Keurig coffee machine for several months before finding these tasty SF Bay fog chasers.  Now I'm using my k-machine nearly every day again and loving it.  The best part of these k-cups is they're not made entirely out of plastic like all the rest.  I do think that the ""all plastic"" k-cups affect the overall taste of the coffee.  The fog chasers have a ""filter paper"" bottom that contributes to a much more authentic brewed coffee taste.  Great deal and a great cup of coffee!!!"
1,This coffee is something all should rave about at the price compared to other you must pay more for a commerical resaurants.
1,"I am a big fan of bolder coffee's and have struggled to find coffee pods that live up to the bold flavor, until now! I am such a fan of the Fog Chaser blend, that I have it on auto ship & save from Amazon!  One taste and you will see!"
1,"Much smaller, less plastic than original k-cup style, good flavor and for the value pricing when you use repeated mailing option. Would recommend the bold version."
1,"Yep - I'm totally sold!  And it's about time too :)  I love a strong / bold flavor that's not too bitter.  My favorite brands were Black Tiger by Coffee People and Extra Bold by Paul Newman.  However, the price of K-Cups keeps going up and up! So I saw these and decided to give it a try. I'm a big fan of Amazon's ""Subscribe & Save"" program b/c it's so flexible where I can choose my delivery from anywhere from once every 1 months, all the way to every 6 months.  So I generally signe-up for the S&S for many things starting off a delivery every 6 months just to see if I like it.  Unfortunately for me I end-up liking many of my S&S items and bumping the delivery to every 2 months! But the price for this at .41 cents is unbeatable.  And the flavor is right up there with my Black Tiger & Extra Bold.  So this is it - I've found my new coffee, at a great price, with less plastic.  A win-win all the way around!"
1,"I love my Keurig, but the cost of the cups had me looking for a better deal, and I was getting tired of adding to the plastic in the world with every cup of coffee.  I tried peeling the tops and bought the new lids to iron on (too messy and time consuming) and I do have the refillable cups you can use repeatedly, but those are messy, too.  I always thought the goal of a Keurig was a quick single cup of good coffee without the mess or fuss of a regular coffee maker. During a recent browsing day on Amazon, I ordered this product.  Surprisingly, the missing bottom to the cup is not an issue!  Spouse and I love the coffee, it is rich (read strong) enough for him, and tasty for me (I add a little hot water to mine.)  If you want to recycle the grounds, they are much easier to get to since you only have to tear open the paper basket on the bottom.  The cups come in sealed bags of 10 cups at a time to preserve freshness, so buying 80 is no problem.  This purchase was cheaper than my local Costco, too.  I also bought the decaf, and it is great as well.  Definitely a recommend!"
1,"This product is exactly what I have been looking for - a reasonably-priced per-serving K-cup!  San Francisco Bay has successfully found a solution to the royalty/licensing issue that has kept K-cup prices in the $0.60-0.80 per-serving range.<br /><br />My requirements for coffee are best described by Louis L'Amour - ""hot as hell and black as sin.""  Surprisingly, the quality of this coffee tops any Starbuck's I have ever tasted.  In fact, having tasted nearly every coffee offered by Gevalia (of which I am a subscriber, and have been for years), I can say San Francisco Bay Coffee rivals even some of the seasonal/limited edition coffees from Gevalia.<br /><br />For anyone snobbish enough to bad-mouth the quality of this coffee, if one is really such a connoisseur of coffee, one should also know enough to keep the bag tightly closed and preferably in the freezer.<br /><br />I wish this family-owned company the best of luck, kudos on meeting a market need in such a delicious way, and PLEASE offer subscriptions in 2- or 3-week intervals!  36ct. will not last me a full month!<br /><br />Protip: Store in an emtpy resealable plastic coffee container in the freezer.<br /><br />EDIT: Looks to me as though someone was dissatisfied with the coffee (for some reason...maybe poor taste) and reinforced their lack of taste by systematically voting every 5-star rating as Unhelpful.  Classy."
1,I have found this to be an excellennt value for the money.Purchasing this excellent full bodied coffee in bulk is a great way to save money over the full retail costs in the grocery store. I like the fact that the mesh K-cups are easy to refill and reuse when if you order the k-cup disposable lids.
1,I was going to go back to a traditional coffee maker until I found these pods.  They are the strong and I enjoy the flavor of the coffee.
1,"I just received my order for the San Francisco Bay K-cups ""Fog Chaser"" I am drinking it as I am writing , it is the BEST....If you like a nice robust coffee with yet a smooth flavor, then this is it. I have tried the actual K-Cup variety and NONE of any of their flavors came even close to this strong, yet , smooth great taste. I will def. be re-ordering this in my future. For the price and the amount you get , $17.49 FOR 36 COUNT whatttttaaaaa deal !!! They are also a lil different then the original K-cups, the have a filter type bottom but fit and brew just fine. I have not tried the Lavazza Gran Crema Expresso or the Dark Hot Chocolate, which was also part of my order, yet... <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IOKA84"">San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Fog Chaser, 36-Count</a>"
1,This is a good strong coffee. The modified k-cup pack works well in my Keurig brewer and I suppose is less wasteful. You can't beat the price especially with subscribe and save!
1,Really love this newly designed cup for my Keurig. Coffee is delicious and aromatic. Less plastic waste is produced and the price is much lower than the traditional k-cups.
1,"I really didn't know what to expect when I ordered this, but the reviews were mostly good so I tried it. I occasionally like a cup of Tully's Kona (outrageously priced right now) or Folgers Black Silk, but I have made the San Francisco Fog Chaser my regular morning cup. The 36-pod order comes in three air-tight bags of 12 each.  I open them as I use them, putting the pods in a jar to maintain freshness.  Going to order more soon!"
1,"Having tried 20 or more different k-cup varieties from Amazon over the past 2 years, I must say that this is probably one of the best (if not THE best) k-cup variety I have purchased.  I was skeptical at first because the pictures showed a lack of complete shell for the coffee, and I wasn't sure how the pressure brewing would work.  But I must say that this coffee has more aroma, strength and flavor than most Keurig brewed coffees.  It comes in small bags, containing 12 each.  I usually transfer them to a freezer bag right away once I open each bag.  This helps keep the flavor a little more.  I like it so much that I started my first coffee subscription from Amazon for this product!  If you love coffee, you MUST give this a try, at least once."
1,"I used to like to try different coffees but after wasting (a lot) of money buying kinds that were a disappointment, I've finally found one to stick with. San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser is my favorite Great coffee - deep, rich, full bodied but not bitter. I especially appreciate the minimal plastic used in the cup. Cups don't fit 100% in my Keurig storage turntable but they do fit. They just fall out a bit more easily."
1,"I was skeptical about this coffee packaging but read the reviews and took the plunge. I was SOOOOO amazed at this coffee. First of all, it is a wonderful, decent strength coffee with no bitterness. Secondly, the packaging is much better for the environment. Thirdly, the value is outstanding!! Just be prepared for a small amount of residue at the end of the cup, a minor thing for such a great coffee!!!"
1,"I read the other reviews and decided to give this brand and style of Keurig cup a try. I, like many, am now a believer. The coffee is excellent and I agree with others who say the taste is enhanced by eliminating the plastic cups other brands use. My wife who is not a ""coffee drinker"" (per se) even prefers these. Also, the price is relatively reasonable."
1,We took a chance after reading the good reviews for this coffee.  We love it.  I find the way they package it to be great for the environment as there is almost no waste.  We keep it sealed in zip lock bags to retain freshness.  We will order it again.
1,"I consider myself a bit of a coffee snob. Living alone I love K-cups ability to brew a single cup instead of wasting a whole pot. I have tried dozens of different K-cups and all of them made a decent cup of coffee but when I really wanted something good I had to use the french press. These K-cups are by far the best. I love opening up a bag of them and smelling that sweet smell of coffee, something you just don't get with the plastic ones. The taste of these is bolder and stronger than even the most potent plastic version. Lastly these will biodegrade a lot quicker than the plastic ones making them better for the environment.<br /><br />One last quick tip: Put them in a ziplock to retain that fresh ground coffee smell and taste."
1,"Found this coffee at Costco, 80 count for $25.95, purchased 1 box, should have bought more!!! Went back today to buy more and they have discontinued it ! My whole Italian Family loves this Fog Chaser Coffee, we have been using other flavors, mostly Paul Newman's, but we like this much better, It is Rich, but not strong, it has a wonderful taste that appeals to us. I will be ordering the 80 count from Amazon, I am so happy to find it available."
1,"I read some reviews stating this coffee was stale and didn't taste good, so I was skeptical, but the price was low enough for me to try at least once.  I'm glad I did!  I would pay $25 for the same amount of K-cups at the store, and this gets delivered to my door for $14!  Not only does this product waste less plastic because of the design, but it also tastes good.  Now, I use a lot of flavored creamer in my coffee, so I may not be the best judge, but my husband, who likes his coffee strong and black, also drinks this coffee daily.  He agrees that it is good, and a bargain too!  This product comes in three individual, sealed bags, each with 12 cups, so I think this helps keep it fresh.  It is definitely worth a try, and they do sell these in stores if you want to buy a smaller package."
1,This coffee is so much better than the K-cups you get in the grocery store. And I love the K-cup design. I'm<br />on auto-ship so I don't run out.
1,"I really enjoy this coffee! I was skeptical about the packaging, thinking it wouldn't fit correctly in my Keurig, but it did! And for the price, AWESOME! I have used the refillable Kcups, the ones where you can get lids and ""refill"" other cups, but hate it! (I guess I am too lazy to keep refilling and cleaning my kcup) This coffee tastes good too, not the best I have had, but good! I still get most of my Kcups from Kohls when I get a 30% off, I stock up-I love the variety packs there! But I will definitely keep getting these!"
1,"this is a very enjoyable 'cup'. the packaging is not a normal plastic,but a mesh of a sort.it did not pose any problem for my machine. the only thing i worry about,perhaps needlessly, will the 'mesh cause a decrease in shelf life.it comes in a airti ght clear plastic package but i break the package and add the kcups to my other kcups on 50 unit display unit. anyway the coffee is nice. im not a expert but i would say its a medium,so it required 2 mugs for my normal bowl movement.im retired so it does not pose a problem.but you younger whipper-snappers may want to keep that in mind. i always kept a small bucket in my car for that reason when i was young,just saying. and no,thats not gross,whats gross is not to have a bucket,cant make it to a rest room,or when u get to one,its in use. be perpared,anyway happyness and peace to u,ur family,and friends,bye-bye."
1,"I had not heard of this brand before, and happened upon it in my local grocery store.  The lower price for a box of 12 cups made me take notice, so I thought I'd try it.  Instant coffee gratification :-)  This is a strong cup of coffee, but it's not overwhelming - at least to my taste.  I prefer some kick and this has got it.  I love the environmentally friendly pod as well.  Definitely will be subscribing and saving!"
1,"they are not contained in the keurig plastic cup so once you open the package, you'll want to put them in an airtight storage but i was really impressed with the smooth flavor and good taste. these were a little cheaper than most of the keurig kcups i've found so i was not sure what to expect but these are deff up there on my favorites list."
1,My daughter introduced me to the San Francisco Bay coffees.  I love them.  This is my favorite of the ones that I have tried.  Fog Chaser!!  The best coffee ever!
1,"I really like this coffee, this was my second order so far. I haven't had a bitter after taste like I have experienced with some other higher priced K-cup brands. I will order again , the price is great & I like the pods better than the original K-cups because the lid is the only plastic in the pod."
1,"Great strong coffee perfect for the morning.  Like the minimal plastic use on the k-cup itself - instead of a plastic bottom it has a paper filter that works fine.  Comes in three bags of 12 cups each, once a bag is opened I just store them in a tupperware until I use them."
1,"I am very pleased with the quality of these coffee k-cups, it makes a great cup of coffee and leaves less of a container going into the landfills."
1,I was disappointed that Timothy's Midnight Magic was no longer available as a Subscribe and Save item. I looked around for a replacement that has a bold flavor and was economical. After reading several reviews I ordered a case of Fog Chaser. This coffee is great. Really great. I also picked up a case of Starbucks Cafe Verona and I prefer the Fog Chaser. It has a wonderful aroma and a bold but not harsh flavor that I really enjoy. The slight inconvenience of having to keep it in a air tight bag to keep it fresh is mitigated by the excellent flavor and price. It's a good trade-off. I have a case coming every month and I may run out sooner.
1,"Great bold taste and aroma.  I would recommend to coffee drinkers who enjoy a strong cup of coffee  Tha pods are ""greener""  in packaging.  Good job San Francisco  bay Co.<br />Fairly priced."
1,SanFrancisco Bay coffee is GREAT love this stuff.  Flavor is very good flavor dark but not bitter will buy again
0,"The price of this coffee and the fact that it could be a little ""earth friendly"" convinced me to at least try it. The coffee came packaged as described, so ""hat's off"" to the seller. But that first cup just didn't do it for me. It's lacking that rich dark coffee taste and the pods leave a residue at the bottom of the cup, so that last gulp just doen't happen. I'd rather fill the little coffee baskets, use a mini-coffee liner and fill it with my favorite coffees than buy this product again. But again, this is a $reasonable$ price for Keurig compatible cofee."
0,"I was hoping this would be as good as many people said, but it falls way short!  The price was great, but the taste wasn't.  It tastes like cheap regular coffeepot coffee!  And it was too weak as compared to many stronger Keurig coffees.  I will stick with my trusted Dark Magic.  I can make a 12oz. cup and have it taste like coffee.  This brand I had to reduce it to 6oz. to get something I could drink. That's not cheaper nor more convenient when I have to make two cups in the morning."
1,"Very good coffee, but must keep bag sealed at all times.  It will pick up other flavors.  Other than that it is great!  AND takes up less room than a kcup."
1,"This is a first impressions review of the unique cup SF Bay uses in place of the traditional sealed K-cup design after using 12 cups.<br /><br />The cups work fine. They may take a few more seconds to brew (I haven't timed it) because the filter bag inflates with the hot water before the coffee comes out. This makes me think that the mesh bag is actually sealed somehow and that seal is broken with the pressure of the hot water as it's injected into the cup. A strong smell test indicates that there is some sort of seal there because there is not a strong coffee smell coming from the dry cups.<br /><br />If there is some sort of seal these cups should stay fresh longer than they would if the coffee was completely exposed to air. I am still storing these cups in the sealed 12 pack bags they came in and would recommend storing them in a sealed container if you don't go through them quickly. The need to store them sealed takes some convenience out of the K-cup system but the lower price of these cups should offset that.<br /><br />As for the coffee itself, it was good, strong, and tasted more like a fresh cup of coffee than any other k-cups I've tried. It could be the coffee or could be the cup itself. I plan to order a few different flavors in this cup style to find out."
1,"I was looking for affordable k-cups online, and came across the San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser - YUM! is all I can say.  It's rich bold coffee with strong flavor, and an environmental friendly packaging at an excellent price.  Highly recommend it if you're thinking about it."
1,"Brews a very good cup of wake up coffee, but wish they had packaged it in a zipper pouch to keep it fresh."
1,I opened my Fog Chaser coffee and immediately thought I had ordered the wrong thing because it looked different from my k cups. I read the reviews and found out I was just confused by the different packaging. I brewed a cup and it was a very good cup of coffee. It worked perfectly in my Keurig maker. My story has a happy ending.
1,Fog Chaser lives up to it's name!!  One cup and I'm good to go.  I love the style of the cup as well... less plastic!
1,"Good and bad for without a bottom k-cup plastic.  Good is that like one user say, no hot water going through another plastic.  Bad, is that you need to keep the coffee in a sealed bag once you opened the factory sealed bag.  I wish it comes with a resealable bag for this.  They already save money by not using the plastic bottom half of the k-cup.<br />The coffee do taste good though."
1,"Fog Chaser is the tastiest full bodied coffee I have had from my Kerig maker. I love this coffee! My husband calls it my ""Foggy day"" coffee. It truly chases the fog away!"
1,"This coffee is very rich and fresh .  The only downside of this product is that when you brew it you should have a wide brimmed cup under it, because it comes out of the pot, in an uneven stream and goes all over.  Other wise its delicious."
1,"This is really a great cup of coffee. It has a deep complex taste and is not at all bitter. It is a good balanced strong tasting brew if made at the 8oz recommended level. While not a K-cup per se, it is just as well thought out with it's open mesh design. It is basically the inside of the K-Cup without the plastic bottom.  The person that gave it 2 stars because he/she says the 1st cup may be good but the rest will go stale, is just plain stupid. I guess he/she has never heard of a plastic bag or container. Once you open the package just stick them in an airtight container or plastic bag...oooh that's difficult! I wonder when he wrote that review if he had something more than just coffee in his cup??"
1,We wanted to try something different and this coffee didn't disappoint!  We prefer bold flavored coffee which this is.  I was concerned that the pods might not fit my basic model Keurig but they fit perfect.  Less waste with these K-Cups because they have a filter type bottom instead of the plastic cup.  We will definatately order these again!
1,The coffee tastes good and the packaging is less wasteful. The price is very nice also. Thanks for providing an alternative to the standard K cup.
1,"Before I purchased this coffee, I read the other reviews. All rated this coffee extremely well, with a few concerns stating it did fit their coffee maker. Not knowing if that would be the case with me, I took a chance and was not dissapointed. It fit my machine with no problem, the smell of the coffee is exquisite and it lives up to the excellent reviews.  Everyone in my family that tried it, loves it.. Keep up the good work!"
1,"No, these do not look like traditional K-cups, but worked perfectly in my machine. They have eliminated the plastic lower portion of the package which has created a more enviromentally friendly product, although many who like to display their pods will be disappointed because you have to stick them in a zip lok bag after opening (boo hoo). If you open a traditional K-cup it looks exactly the same. Anyway, the coffee is amazing!! Bold but not overwhelming. Perfect for starting the day!<br /><br />Thanks for providing these Amazon!"
1,Have the rest of you coffee lovers nearly fainted over the sharply rising price of coffee? When Amazon sent me an email with a link to this coffee it was cheap enough that I thought I would give it a try. I use and love Newman's Own Organic-Caribou Blend and Sumatran Reserve on a daily basis. The price on those k-cups right now is $65 to $.70 per k-cup. I am always looking for a good bold k-cup that is less expensive. These look different than a k-cup and they need to be in an airtight container after you open them. You need a small container as you only open 12 at a time-the rest stay vacuum sealed. I can't understand the fuss about the packaging-it is a simple thing to put them in a Tupperware type container. The bottom line for me is that the subscription price for this coffer is about $.41 per serving as opposed to $.70 per serving-and the coffee is GREAT! I love the coffee and I now drink it daily. I have not given up the expensive blends that I love-but this one works for me for my 3rd and 4th cup of the day. Just give it a try-some of you will not like it-but some of you will find it to be an excellent and reasonably priced supplement to those very expensive k-cups that we all love.
1,"I brew a double cup out of one kcup and it is still nice and strong. The cups are like a cup/pod hybrid, so I store them in a ziploc baggie. Love these, great price for great coffee!"
1,"I had to try this coffee in an attempt to find a lower price on k-cups. I love it! It's a good strong brew, with a nice smoky aroma. The 36-count comes as 3 plastic bags of 12 cups. After opening the 1st bag, I'm keeping the remainder in the bag, sealed with a clip. It's possible that these could have freshness issues if left out for several days/weeks. I don't think my supply will last long enough to go bad though. I like the idea of less plastic - I like to compost my coffee grounds in the summer and these have much easier access to dumping out the grounds. (I can just tear open the mesh bag.) They fit in the Keurig and brew just fine.<br /><br />In fact, I usually buy the strongest coffee k-cups so I can ""double-brew"" mine into a bigger mug. True coffee aficionados may not prefer this. It may be too strong if you like lighter roasts or flavored coffees.<br /><br />Tastes great, cheaper and more environmentally friendly than other k-cups!"
0,"I wanted to try this in my K-cup brewer because of the positive reviews and the lower price; however, I did not like the flavor of the fog chaser coffee.  I've since tried the rainforest blend, which is better, but still not as good as the Donut House k-cups from Coffee People,which I chose when the Kona blend was no longer available.  I'm debating whether to try the breakfast blend; too bad I have to purchase 36 of them just to try them, though."
0,"this stuff is so oily, you probably could run your car on it. it takes 1\4 cup creamer to make it change from black to tan ick !!!!"
0,"I was enticed by the cool design - less trash is good. The price obviously was also very enticing.<br />When the coffee arrived, I carefully transferred the pods to a plastic ziploc bag.<br />So far, so good. I then proceeded to brew my first cup - all excited to have found something wonderful.<br />Well, the excitement ceased when the cup produced was pure black liquid with a flavor that was not pleasing to my palate - at all. Maybe if you like bitterness in a coffee without the pleasantness of a well-rounded rich coffee, then this is for you.<br />I found it not an experience to be repeated. I tried to like this coffee, but will go back to another brand. Sorry San Francisco Bay Coffee company - I really tried. The decaf French Roast was even less likable..."
0,This coffee is very stale tasting and gives off no good aroma.  I thought I would be getting a strong coffee because of the name!  Instead it is very weak.  I can't return it so in the garbage it will go or maybe sell it at my next garage sale.
0,"When I received my latest order, the bag said ""36 count"" but there are only 12 K-cups inside.  That makes this very very expensive coffee."
0,This coffee is horrible and unfortunately not eligible for return. It tastes like burnt wood shavings. Looks like its going into the compost pile.
0,"This coffee was not even drinkable. It was so strong even adding double the water and extra cream and sugar didn't help. We like strong coffees, Starbucks original, but this was too much."
0,"I regret to say that we were disappointed with the coffee pods.  Immediately upon opening the package there was an obvious lack of wonderful coffee aroma, but rather a stale one.  Although the title of the coffee itself was most appealing, we would not purchase again.  Thanks for letting me remark.<br /><br />\"
1,"Finally...a coffee for my new machine that I like.  Usually the coffee I have tried has been too bitter with a nasty after taste.  This Fog Chaser is just wonderful.  I can finally enjoy more than one cup of coffee in my day.  Any coffee will pretty much do first thing in the morning, but that awful after taste has no place in my afternoons.  Fog Chaser is flavorful but smooth. If you have had difficulty finding a good coffee for the new machines, do give this one a try."
0,"I have been drinking coffee for over 40 plus years now.  Folks, I have tried so many varieties from Instant to Drip to K cups, and the list goes on.  Hopefully, the reader gets the picture...I love my coffee.  Yet, I am not sure what this ""stuff"" is.  Here is my experience...<br /><br />First, I get the shipment.  Open it up, and I must admit, I do like the nice box the coffee arrives in.  I do appreciate the added note on the box from the Robinson Family along with their mission statement.<br /><br />""Taste the Difference - Make a Difference - Community Aid Program"" and there is more information on the side of the box which really sort of made me ""feel good"" about my purchase.  The Robinson Family goes on to state ""Offering the best value to you, our customer.  Treating our employees, suppliers, and customers as if they were part of our family.""  I mean all this really made me feel good and I was glad I had purchased a product where a ""family"" supported others...<br /><br />Yet, that is where it ended.  I opened the box, cut open the plastic sealed containers this ""cups"" come in, and grabbed my first little strange looking but new looking ""k cup"".  Please note, as others have said, these are completely different than an actual ""k cup"", but I thought unique and liked the design....<br /><br />UNTIL...yes, UNTIL...I hate to write this, but the very first thing I noted on the side of this ""bag cup"" was something that looked like a bug!!  It politely dropped in the palm of my hand, and since it was not ""wiggling"", I figured I could examine it very closely.  I did....<br /><br />YUCK!  It was some sort of freaking small, slim BUG!!  I thought maybe it was my ole' eyes, but had my son examine it and he confirmed my verdict....<br /><br />Did I go ahead and try the coffee???  Well, again, I hate to admit this, but I figured the bug could not ""kill"" me, so yes...I went ahead and tried the other ""cup"" things (honestly, I don't know what to call these little cups"").  My first reaction was just ""disgust""...The flavor was weak and the cream and sugar simply diluted to the bottom of the cup.  Nothing like the Rev K Cups or other K cups I had used...<br /><br />So, I went to the computer to write a review...no, not today I thought...I wanted to be fair, because, again, I felt a part of the ""Family"" the manufacturer had written about on the box...and maybe the ""bug"" was still in my mind!<br /><br />Thus, here I sit today several days later, and just finished another of these cups....and after using a few of the things...I just honestly cannot understand why all the high positives written by other reviewers?  Honestly?  I am trying to like these things due to the price and the ""Family"" caring thing...but, this coffee is simply too weak and does not taste like ""coffee"" to me.  In comparison, it sort of reminds me of an off the wall instant coffee on the weak scale...<br /><br />Folks, all of you who have written such positive reviews...trust me, I want to be open minded...I want to like this coffee.  I tried smaller cups on my K cup machine, and it simply gets worse...<br /><br />So, in conclusion, maybe I got a ""bad box""?  I mean should there have been a ""bug"" in it to begin with??  Even with that...get past the bug issue...where is the flavor?  Why does the cream and sugar simply dissolve to the bottom of the cup leaving a bad looking residue as you get to the last sip?  It dissolves ""into the coffee"" with other brands...<br /><br />I love the price, and wish I could like this...is there another type other than the ""Fog Chaser""???  Would like to stay with the Robinson Family, but not left in the ""Fog"" as this is sort of how I feel trying to drink this coffee .....""Fog Chaser""????  Well, I am definitely ""chasing the Fog""...trying to understand how this is called ""coffee""????<br /><br />I will continue through this box the best I can, and ""if"" I find one of the cups different, then in all fairness, I will update this review to treat the ""Robinson Family"" fair...And yes, I guess maybe I am crazy to drink through all these things since the bug was on the first one, but I figure the hot water should kill any harmful bacteria...hope I am right??  But, again, I want to emphasize, it is not the ""bug"" that is causing my dislike of this ""wattery, weak...very odd coffee""....."
0,"The Good:<br />+ Eco-friendly packaging<br />+ Less expensive per cup<br /><br />The Bad:<br />+ Stale taste<br /><br />While I was excited to see the innovative packaging of this new product, it just doesn't taste good.  It tastes likes the coffee is stale, which makes sense considering that the coffee is exposed to air.  I realize the packaging reduces the amount of ""exposed air"" but it doesn't matter - the taste speaks for itself."
0,"As others have mentioned, these arent k-cups.  Its a paper top with a filter bag full of coffee stuck to it, no plastic bottom.  So the coffee will go stale far faster than a real k-cup and they dont fit properly in my k-cup rack.<br /><br />You have to license the patented k-cup design and pay green mountain a couple of pennies per cup made in royalties, these guys seem to have tried to cut that corner.  But I wont buy them again, I buy k-cups because I want a fresh cup of coffee not something thats been exposed to circulating air until I use it."
0,"Im usually happy with all my purchases from Amazon, however this was my worst purchase ever. I went by other peoples reviews when I purchased this coffee. The coffee was rated good by everyone so I took my chances and ordered it. My boyfriend and I both tried it and it was not drinkable! The taste and the smell of it was terrible! I didn't even feel I could give them away to anyone because I didn't want to subject anyone else to the terrible taste of it, so I tossed them in the garbage. What a waste of money! I will stick with familiar brands like Green Mountain."
0,"Received the package and tried one out immediately. I don't know what the expected shelf life is on a coffe kcup but I think this one expired a long time ago. The coffee had a harsh smell, like when you left the can open and the coffee went stale. The taste was bitter and did not meet my expectations. Cross it off my list!!!!"
0,"I'm all for eco-friendlier packaging, but this coffee goes bad the minute you open the package. Even the first pod out is a bit stale, and anyhow the flavor is terrible to begin with. Yuck!"
0,This is NOT equal to doughnut shop coffee.<br />This is a STRONG coffee. Not to my likeing!!!!<br />I would NOT recommend it...
0,"I made the mistake of buying 72 of these K-cups. The other reviews were good, so I thought I would like them. First of all, I enjoy strong coffee thats not bitter.  When I got these and opened up a pack, the odor was wierd, in a way thats kind of hard to describe, they smelled terrible, not like coffee at all. They are to be used in the Keurig machines but have a filter casing, not plastic like the regular K- cups, which is not a problem.  The coffee tasted terrible. The date was fresh, so it wasnt that the coffee was old. I will never again waste my money on this brand.  I cant understand why the company would put out a product like this and expect it to sell, I for one will never buy it again.  I drink alot of coffee, 4 cups at least daily, So far the best ones I have had are the Starbucks,Caribou,and Newmans Own (bold).I hope this helps with your future buying decision. John from Buffalo"
0,"While I am happy with the coffee itself, I find the description of this item as ""for Keurig K-Cup Brewers"" to be slightly misleading.<br /><br />As a recent reviewer points out that these OneCup pods are mesh pouches with a foil top. Twelve of these pods are contained in a sealed plastic bag. Once the bag is opened, the coffee does seem to be more ""exposed"" to air which raises the possibility that they then go stale faster than a sealed K-Cup.<br /><br />Comments on the previous review said that the coffee has noticeable degradation in quality after 14 days of opening the sealed plastic bag. This seems unacceptable to me because the point of a Keurig Brewer is choice - having to use all 12 OneCups within 14 days limits my ability to choose other coffees.<br /><br />All considered, the company is using this ""OneCup"" packaging to expand their market to other brewing systems and save the costs associated with multiple types of packaging (and possibly multiple licensing agreements?). They pass this savings on by pricing these cups a couple cents less per cup than K-Cups - the price can be further reduced a few cents with Subscribe and Save. Subscribe and Save was the initial reason why I chose these cups - being a convenient way to keep a steady supply of a ""house"" coffee for myself and guests. This convenience is reduced by the fact that the packaging is not ideal for maintaining freshness. As noted by other commenters, the solution may be to put the rest of the OneCups into a Ziplock bag and hope that this will maintain freshness until I use up the others - not exactly elegant."
1,This has become one of my favorite K-cup coffees. It has a great bold taste. I will certainly be buying again.
1,"What some think is residue is actually crema, though not as heavy as in an espresso shot. Crema is a flavorful, aromatic, reddish-brown froth made when air bubbles combine with fine-ground coffee's soluble oils. The strong presence of crema indicates a quality, well-ground coffee Crema helps give espresso a fuller flavor, longer aftertaste than drip coffee. This is excellent coffee and the crema makes it better."
1,"This was a repeat purchase, so nothing more need be said!  Although this is a very pleasing coffee, it is not Jet Fuel.  This is not a knock, but rather a statement of fact!  Fog Chaser has its own taste, one you don't have to search for.  Once the pak of 12 has been opened, store the remaining pods in a seal-tight container.  And the PRICE is RIGHT!  :o)"
1,"San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser coffee is one of the best coffees my husband has ever had.  If you like a bold coffee that is not the least bit bitter, he says this is the one. It is my husbands favorite.  Buy it and enjoy.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IOKA84"">San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Fog Chaser, 36-Count</a>"
1,"Like many others, the price point of this coffee got my attention but what's the point of cheaper coffee that's all but undrinkable... Grove Square, anyone?<br /><br />So before ordering on price alone I wanted to see other reviewers contrast and compare this blend to other k-cups such as Timothy's Midnight Magic, Emeril's Extra Bold or Jet Fuel. After all, given the wide disparity of opinion about which k-cup blend is bold, strong or rich in flavor, at least finding common ground with others who enjoy the aforementioned brands you can estimate the appeal of the flavor to your own palate.<br /><br />At the time I placed my order I didn't find any clear indicators from other reviewers along these lines, hence for what it's worth, as one who enjoys the previously mentioned k-cups, I can say that overall San Francisco Bay French Roast measures up pretty darn well to the more expensive brands.<br /><br />Now if cost were not a factor I'm not certain this would be my first choice as this blend has a somewhat smoky after taste and I prefer a more fruity or sweet flavor. But hey, this is French Roast and as such the taste seems well suited.<br />Nevertheless, no regrets...it's a nice bold brew (with an appealing price) that I look forward each morning."
0,When I purchased this I wasn't concerned about not being a traditional k cup and I was looking for a cheaper bold coffee. This just doesn't do it. It's a medium at best and not very consistant from pod to pod. I won't be purchashing this again..
1,"I thought I would try these K-cups because they were about 15% less expensive than the other ones available.  I was a little concerned with the packaging in that the bottom of the K-cup is a filter and not solid plastic like a standard one.  However, aside from a very fine trace at the bottom of my coffee mug, there is no mess and no fuss.  The coffee is very smooth, too.  I will be making this one of my regular choices for K-cups from now on."
1,"I was ready to order a bunch more of this but then they jacked the price, from 36 cents s&s to 45 a cup. I can get coffee for this price at Costco. So I'm cancelling my s&s. Too bad, because it is really great coffee."
0,"I bought these expecting a standard K cup.  What I received was a coffee pod that is smaller in size than a K cup and appears to be a ""filter"" type material vice a plastic container.  As a result, they do not fit in the standard K cup dispensers and the coffee does not stay fresh like the standard K cup.  It appears the ""filter"" type material (like fine rice paper) of this coffee pod allows free flow of air and allows the coffee to go stale.  Requires you to store the coffee pods in a zip lock bag to ensure freshness remains.<br /><br />I will not buy these type K coffee pods again and I am surprised that the Amazon web site does not clearly identify the K cup material issue<br /><br />++++++++++++++++++<br />UPDATE-I emailed Amazon regarding the web site issue not being clear as to KCup packaging type.  Amazon refunded my money since they want the customer happy.  Amazon is a great place to shop and has high customer focus and is very much appreciated."
0,"I'm shocked at all the good reviews for this sludge...I found it to be akin to VERY watery mud. Horrible, and not an item eligible for return with Amazon unfortunately. A total rip off! Now, I'll splurge for the keurig k-cups; lesson learned the hard way :("
0,if you buy this coffee you will know you made a mistake when you open the first plastic bag it comes packaged in. You can tell by the smell that it's.......NOT!
1,"the coffee was not that good at first; it had a strong smell that kind of reminded me of an ashtray (seriously, it did)! But after a couple of cups it became very tasty and it had a nice kick to it. So, give it a chance and you'll probably like it."
0,"This has got to be the worst thing I've tasted out of my Keurig, ever!! I couldn't even finish the cup I brewed.<br /><br />I don't really mind that they're not actually K-Cups. Who cares if they get stale? You're not going to want to drink the coffee even if it's fresh.<br /><br />I just wanted to edit to describe the flavor better. It tastes burnt. It tastes like someone put their cigarette out in my coffee. I'm out of my good Timothy's K-Cups so I had to use these again tonight, and once again, I'm bot going to be able to finish it."
0,"I'd like to be able to review this product - however, San Francisco Coffee did not include it in my shipment. Although noted on the invoice, along with the French Roast ordered, they sent two boxes of French Roast and did not correct the shipment when notified.  Therefore, one star it is!<br />BTW - the French Roast is a 4 star."
0,"this has a chemical taste that ruins it for me, have to put in extra creme. will not buy again, will go back to<br />dognut shop, which is excellent."
0,First of all the way the K-cup is pakaged tends to let the product dry out.Also found the coffee weak tasting......
0,"The cups are smaller and hold less coffee than the competitors. They also are not airtight so will degrade once the package is opened unless used quickly.  But even if used quickly they are weak and watery.  Actually, more like dishwater.  They should come with a warning label.  I would have wanted to know that they were weak and watery by design."
0,"Extremely disappointed in the quality of this brand's brewing quality.  Will not order this particular brand again.  Will dispose of, instead of being disappointed the majority of the time."
0,"Thought I was getting a good deal on these K-cups...but this is the worst coffee we have ever had!  The taste is so strange and for it to be called Fog Chaser, I thought it would be strong.  It's not very weak...see through coffee.  Will never buy again."
0,"I bought these at the grocery store just to try them. They are probably the worst k cups ever. The taste is terrible. I tried both the fog chaser and rainforest blend. They both taste awful, like bark and dirt. There is dark brown ""sediment"" left in the bottom of the cup when you drink this brand. I find that the taste is strong in the dirt department, but highly lacking in the coffee flavor area. I will never buy these again. I like my coffee in the morning, but I actually dread having to use these if there is nothing else available."
0,"Its not a real K cup.<br /><br />There is no way to store them except in a air tight container or ziplock bag, also when you get to the bottom of your coffee cup there is alot of sediment and grounds,its really gross.<br /><br />I would stick the real K Cups and skip this.Remember amazon does not offer refunds on this either since its a grocery item."
1,"I believe this coffee tastes as good as any brand of K-Cup I've ever tried while currently costing about a third less (using subscribe and save on Amazon).  It actually tastes fresher to me than other K-Cups, possibly because it arrives packed in a plastic bag which seems airtight until opened."
1,"I have my concerns about this coffee's packaging, but the important part first: It tastes good. Fog Chaser is a little more robust than I like for a morning blend (I tend toward a Dunkin Donuts style coffee first thing in the AM), but is perfect for afternoon or evening. The nonstandard pods fit into my B70 and while there has been occasional sediment, it's not been a problem with the majority of my 36-pod pack; at least, not as bad as (say) Grove Square. Yes, I'd buy these again.<br /><br />Now the negatives. As has been stated, the pods aren't plastic cups with embedded filters, sealed by a foil cover, but rather filter pouches with a plastic ring and foil cover. There's no need to punch a drain hole in the plastic cup, since there isn't one. I've heard concerns about the Keurig success causing more spent K-cups to be dumped in trash tips and landfills; I'd also guess that the construction makes it a non-trivial recycling task. So a redesign with less plastic would seem like a good thing.<br /><br />However, one of the charms of Keurig is that the cup is packed in a relatively inert gas: I've heard nitrogen, which would make sense. Oxygen is the enemy of coffee. Old coffee goes stale because it oxidizes. Keeping air away from coffee keeps it fresh... but the coffee in the San Francisco Bay Coffee company's packaging hasn't this feature. The bags (containing twelve pods each) are heavy-duty plastic with a metal button of unknown purpose, and perhaps those bags are filled with something other than oxygen... but as soon as you take them out, the coffee begins to deteriorate.<br /><br />Not that this happens in a matter of seconds, or even days. After all, keeping the lid on a pound can of coffee (I can actually remember when a pound was sixteen ounces, not 13.5) kept the coffee fresh enough, assuming you were a regular drinker. If you use a ziploc bag to store the unused pods from an opened bag, I'm sure that they'll stay fresh enough in the week or two that the bag lasts.<br /><br />My concern, though, is for occasional coffee drinkers, for whom the Keurig system is a godsend. For example, I dated a woman who hated coffee, but wanted me to have some when I visited. Having fresh coffee in an inert storage container would have been great. These, though, might go bad in between my visits to her house.<br /><br />So in conclusion, go ahead and buy these if you're a frequent coffee drinker who will finish a whole 12-pod bag in less than a month. Keep a couple of ziploc bags (sandwich bags hold 6) for storage. Companies that go through a whole lot of K-cups ought really to like these, especially since they're about 10% under the cost of most K-cups."
1,"The K-cups have a plastic ring around the top but the bottom part is porous - I could smell the coffee when I<br />opened the pack...cannot store in KCup rack and must keep them in a ziplock bag to keep coffee fresh..that is why I gave it only 4 stars Each order comes in three 12-pack bags...Oh...the taste is great...nice and strong, and dark as well."
1,"I ordered this on a whim when I received an e-mail from Amazon about new deals in k-cups. I'm always looking to mix up my selection because that is one of the true benefits of the Keurig machines. I read the reviews trying to determine how dark/strong Fog Chaser was and could not quite nail down the strength. I relied on the name and thankfully knew about the packaging. I keep mine in a canister after realizing I had an extra one to spare, which will keep the air out. I quite liked the k-cup design, it looks like it creates less waste.<br /><br />Fog Chaser clearly says on the side that it is a darker brown but does not show that it is the strongest. I will have to investigate which is stronger. This k-cup did give me a nice smooth strong 12 oz cup of coffee. It had no weird after taste and it wasn't bitter. I forgive bitter strong coffees because that is a product, often enough, of stronger coffees that could be manufactured better. I'm no snob but I also don't drink watered down coffee (i.e. Starbuck's new Blonde coffee).<br /><br />I will definitely order this again. I've never had coffee from this company before but I think I'm quite the fan. I also ordered the 3 12 packs because they shipped sooner and the idea that they would stay fresher longer was appealing. The price was slightly higher though, of course. Now that I have a canister that fits 36, I will go ahead and buy the other packaging and likely subscribe."
1,"I purchased this 3 pack for my parents as a pre-Christmas gift. (I did not want to be late or it the shipping date to get away from me!)<br /><br />They LOVE the taste and aroma, both are in sync.<br /><br />It is worth it as a gift and for yourself if you are a true coffee lover and especially a ""K-Cup"" fan!"
1,"I was a little worried about this k-cup since it is shaped differently from the regular k-cups. Instead of being in a fully plastic container, only the top is plastic. The bottom part is enclosed in a coffee filter type holding. While this means that when I opened the sealed wrapper I was hit with the delicious aroma of coffee, something I miss when I open a regular pack of k-cups, it also means I have to store the remaining cups in a tupperware or storage ziploc type bag to keep the remaining cups from going stale. This isn't a big deal, just something to mention. These also wouldn't fit in the normal k-cup carousel.<br /><br />I have a b60 and the cup fit perfectly, brewed up great, disposal was easy and the filter didn't tear or leak as I was throwing it way.<br /><br />Fog chaser is a bold deep brew (I brew on the middle button of my keurig) The coffee is very smooth and mellow with a terrific aroma. There is no bitter or burned taste. This is quickly becoming my favorite keurig coffee and I can't wait to try the other offerings from this company."
0,"I've urged Amazon to change this product's listing so as not to trick anyone else into buying it, but until they do, I want to add my voice to the revelations hidden in a few reviews that are already here. Please be warned that while the first cup of this coffee is tasty, the second is unlikely to be as good, and the twelfth is almost guaranteed to be disappointing unless you're the twelve-cup-a-day sort of household.<br /><br />Why? Simply put, these are not K-Cups. They are not individually sealed portions, but instead are open mesh coffee pods, not dissimilar to Senseo pods, topped with a K-Cup-like plastic ring and foil cover. That cover does make them work in Keurig brewers, but you lose the important freshness-preserving feature of K-Cups. The company could lessen this problem by putting its pods in a resealable plastic bag, but they chose to instead use a plastic bag reminiscent of those in cereal boxes -- just much, much harder to open. That's especially ironic given Amazon's recent move toward frustration-free packaging.<br /><br />I strongly encourage you to move on to another product until the San Francisco Bay Coffee folks can temper their (laudable) green-focused pod design with some reasonable solution for keeping the coffee fresh for more than a day or so once you open the box."
1,"I have not picked this item up on Amazon but in a retail store in my area in North Carolina.  I had seen it on Amazon but when I saw it local I gave it a try and I am glad I did.  This is a rich and robust flavor, with a note of nuts, one that wipes the cobwebs away in the morning.  Yes it is nice that the product uses less plastic but that is only a side note the quality of the coffee is top notch.  The only negative side comment I can make is that sometimes the top gets stuck on the upper needle of the Keurig but no problem just pull it off from the top rather than picking it up out of the brewing basket, and if you close the machine and open again it is always off the needle anyway."
1,"This is my second favorite flavor from SFBC.  Breakfast blend is still the best.  All flavors have plenty of flavor for a 16oz travel mug. (If you don't have the larger cup size on your machine, brew at the small cup setting and lift the handle and brew again) Can't beat the value especially if you get them via Amazon subscription.  Hey Amazon when are you going to sell these in the 80 pack?"
1,"Having a cup, soon to be two cups, of Fog Chaser from San Francisco Bay Coffee this morning. Very good. They call these ""OneCup"" but they work in Keurig brewers. Guessing this is a result of the k-cup patent or copyright, whatever it is, running out but wow, this is some good good coffee."
1,"We've ordered the Fog Chaser OneCup twice now. The first time we ordered it, I LOVED it. We are avid coffee drinkers in my house, and both love a nice bold coffee. Since the price was right and we liked the coffee, we ordered again. The 2nd shipment we received was still ""good"" coffee, but it wasn't as great as the first. My husband says he couldn't tell much difference, but the 2nd shipment did not have the same smooth finish and mouth-watering aroma as the original. That being said, it did not stop us from drinking it all, but I do have to wonder which is the abnormality! I rated this at a 4 since we were so impressed by the first shipment, and I really like the way the OneCup brews. As other reviewers mentioned, there is a ""crema"" produced by the OneCup that you rarely see with a K-Cup, which is NICE! I like the less packaging, and don't mind the occasional sediment in my cup (when we brew coffee, we generally do French Press, so we can handle that!). If I had the option of rating 3.5 I would have, since the quality of the 2nd shipment would definitely rank a 3 most likely. I do think we will try this again and see if ""the third time is the charm"". I will try to remember to update on what we think so that we can provide some feedback as far as consistency goes.<br />Thanks for reading!"
1,"Bold and rich. LOVE this coffee for a fast wake-me-up in the morning, and pick-me-up mid day. The name is perfectly suited to the delightful temperament of this brew. MUST store in airtight container after opening the plastic bags though, or coffee will lose it's potency."
1,"Recently I have become more and more choosy with my coffee. I own a Keurig one-cup brewer as well as a traditional coffee maker.<br />For years, I have been using the same coffee brand ( med or dark, middle-of-the road priced) and it was affordable and it tasted just fine. Lately, I was lacking depth and body when brewing in the keurig( I have the cup you can put your own coffee in, which saves resources and $). It seemed like I couldnt' pack enough flavor into the little chamber to really have the right strength. The pre-packed, ready to use K cups were much better, but at 3 cups/day for me not feasible in the long run.<br />I read the reviews of the San Francisco Bay coffee ( fog chaser) and the price appealed to me and also what customers had described, so I tried it. Besides the much more affordable price and far more ""green"" packaging, I find the flavor fantastic!<br />Bold, yet sophisticated, not just strong- really pleasant flavor ! A very good choice at an attractive price!. These cups look different, but I like them much better with their filter-like body and 12-count bagging. Now I don't feel guilty when I indulge with more than 1 K cup. For loose coffee to put into the reusable cup I choose a def. dark roast like italian or french, which is very comparable to the Fog chaser's aroma."
1,"There are so many k cups and flavors out there...for a baseline, my go to cup was donut shop by the coffee people, until now.  I really enjoy this coffee and will purchase again.  Smells very fresh, like the packaging (not just 50 thrown in a box), lower price than competitors, and the flavor is perfect for me.  Great job San Francisco Bay!"
1,"SFBC's Fog Chaser is on the bold side... dark, rich, but not too much aftertaste.  A great daily coffee. Be aware that the entire cup is not plastic, but the bottom portion is almost filter material. This might affect how long you keep the cups before using. The cups are vacuum sealed into a larger plastic bag, so that should help with freshness...<br /><br />The cost is on the low end for k-cups and makes this coffee even more inviting!!!  I definitely recommend as a staple daily coffee.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay"
1,The Keurig cups always had something missing. They reminded me of coffee but always tasted a little funny. I really do think it's all the plastic surrounding the coffee. I didn't get much use out of my Keurig until I found this coffee. I am reordering today!
1,"Can't beat this price and tastes decent! Impressed with the k cup design, no mess. Will be buying more for sure"
1,"Fantastic Coffee, at a a fraction of the price of the freeze dried Keurig K-cup's, all of which are made by the same company, with the same tasteless coffee bean, no matter what the name of the coffee.  I can't imagine paying a dollar a cup for a ""donut house"" k-cup that is made of Folgers.  What a joke."
1,"This is a great pod to reduce some of the wear and tear on the keurig, the coffee tastes good, no grounds in contrast with other reviews, less packaging, and it's a nice size package to keep ""in reserve"".  Better than Folgers, better than Donut House, not as good as Newman's Own.  That's about the limit of my K-cup experience so far."
1,"I love this coffee. I started buying it in the grocery store, but this is a lot cheaper at Amazon. Rich, flavorful, and smells just like I ground the beans myself. Going to re-order right now."
1,"I just received my 80 count box of San Francisco Fog Chaser K-Cups.  I ripped open one of the dated/sealed packets, pulled out one of the 10 coffee pods.<br />I made a cup of coffee, perfecto.  Best coffee I've had from this machine hands down, and I've probably put 50 different brands and made over 1000 cups from this guy.<br /><br />Highly recommended."
1,"The coffee comes in the K-cup filters without a bottom.  I assume this is to save money and reduce plastic.  It works fine in all K-cup brewers that I've tried.<br /><br />The coffee itself is really good.  It has a very bold taste but not too bitter.  Tastes much better with some cream and sugar.<br /><br />I ended up subscribing to these because I like them so much.  Definitely worth a try for coffee drinkers.  I only give items 5 stars if they far exceed expectations, so this gets 4 stars."
1,"I was looking for a good quality coffee in a K-cup to use with my Kuerig. I have the reusable cup and love it but was looking for the convenience of the pre-filled K-cups for workday mornings.<br /><br />These K-cups were exactly what I was looking for, convenience and delicious coffee! I prefer a bolder coffee and this Fog Chaser fit the bill. I also felt this was an excellent deal considering most K-cups retail for $10.00-$16.99 for a package of 12 K-cups (and sometimes 10) and this was 80 cups for just over $30.00. The other thing I love about this is being able to have it on the subscription program.  You can set up your delivery to be delivered whenever you like beginning with 1 month intervals and you get a small discount on the price when you order through a subscription. With a quantity of 80, I've set my deliveries to come every 4 months but it may turn out that I will have to shorten it to every three months.<br /><br />If you have a Kuerig and love the convenience of the pre-filled K-cups, you can't go wrong with this product. It is a bold coffee but this company makes several types that are available in several blends. I highly recommend this product and the added  value of the subscription option."
1,"When I got my Keurig, I couldn't wait to get my favorite Starbucks coffee in K Cups. When I saw this, I liked the design of the cup and the price is much better too. I'm so glad I decided to give it a try. Doing a side by side comparison, Fog Chaser wins hands down! If you like a bold cup that lingers on your tongue and hold up under creamer too (I use unsweetened coconut milk), you will be happy you tried this coffee. Oh! A huge added bonus of the new environmentally friendly K Cup design is that you get that heavenly coffee aroma from the minute you open the vacuum sealed bag! You don't have to wait until its brewing to ""wake up and smell the coffee!"" :)"
1,"This is the best coffee I've had since my Mom's percolator brand.  The best part though is the cup can be re-used. I have a K-cap <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0053CEPP6"">My-Kap Green Reusable 3 Piece Cap Set for K-Cups</a> and I just clean out the cup and refill with whatever coffee I choose.  It's really the perfect design for re-use as the grounds dry out completely overnight and dump out very easily. I'm buying the whole bean San Francisco coffee to grind and refill the cup. The possibilities are endless!"
1,"Personally, I received this product by going down the list of K-Cups trying to find that perfect cup to put on scheduled delivery.  This is a nice bold coffee, and oddly fiscal.  I personally like the first brew, and the house mate likes the second and third, now THAT is a good deal."
1,"Cheaper than typical k-cups, more environmentally friendly, and better, fresher, stronger coffee. This stuff is dynamite.  They're priced where the traditional k-cups used to be priced, but they're better coffee."
1,"I adore this coffee!!! I also tried the french roast style (which i usually drink in other brands) BUT I LOVE this FOG LIFTER roast so much better! It's simply the best K-Cup I've had! And the cost is amazing, especially if you sign up for auto delivery, which is cool because you can choose your delivery time and not just a default one!!! LOVE IT! WILL KEEP PURCHASING FOR SURE!"
1,Bought this product however it doesnt seem like a great way to keep the coffee airtight. I tried the other K-cup similar cups and they seem to keep it fresher.
1,This is a robust roast. Definitely a morning coffee.  We love the flavor and the value! Be sure to store in an airtight container to maintain the flavor.
1,"I don't usually write a review unless I think a item deserves it but this coffee deserves it. It came in 3 separate vacuum sealed bags. Make sure you store them in a proper container after you open them or they will go bad. When I opened one, the smell was super strong. I thought the coffee was going to be bitter but after brewing it in my Keurig B130 a few times I was hooked. Not bitter at all but the smell is a little strong. But it grew on me. I brew it with 8oz. of water and the strength is good enough for me. Just a bit of creamer or milk and no sugar. I drink only a cup a day. Also, its cheaper than normal K cups and less waste. I'm not going to say that this will be my favorite forever, but it is good and if you are looking at trying something new with your K cup maker then these are worth a shot. I will keep these stocked along with other the flavors of K cups I have enjoyed."
1,"I recently purchased these K-Cups, I have to admit, because of the price per cup. And now I can honestly say I will never go back to the regular K-Cups again! I usually run a K-Cup through the largest setting and then through the smallest (my coffee cup is rather large :). This Fog Chaser coffee holds up rather well. I've gotten a great, bold cup of joe every morning since receiving these. There have been no problems with grounds in the cup as sometimes happens with regular K-Cups or the refillable K-Cups.<br /><br />The 80 count box came with a reusable storage container that holds a week of pods. It's just a flimsy, clear plastic container but it does keep the coffee fresh."
1,"This is the second month we've ordered this coffee and love it!  If you like a strong cup of coffee, this is it.  And, the price can't be beat!"
1,"The fog chaser has a great bold body taste,unlike some brands which leave a harsh after taste.Great product which I recommend."
1,I have tried 5 or 6 different brands and found this brand to be the better one. I am sticking with this for now.
1,"First time trying SF coffee and found it to be a good coffee with a reasonable taste. Yes, the coffee smells burned prior to use but I believe thatunless you are a  connoisseur of coffee I believe most might smelled ""burnt"".  Good coffee for the price and the ""K-Cup"" new packaging works just as well as the original stle K-Cup packaging. I believe I will try another brand for taste but would stay with SFbay if the price were 5 cents less per cup.  I drink alot of coffee.!!"
0,"Not the coffee for us. Very strong. Did the subscribe and save, for got to cancel the next shipment, went to and complete the return forms- No such luck. Great idea, just tastes awful. First item that I could not return, back to buy coffee at QVC, they will take it back if we do not like it."
1,"Ahhh...nothing like a good cup of coffee! I'm a bargain hunter and have considered going back to my drip coffee due to the rising prices of K cups.I read all the reviews,and feeling there was nothing to lose I debated between French Roast and Fog Chaser. San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser did not disappoint (haven't tried the French Roast yet). Fog Chaser is a moderatly bold coffee, smooth, with no hint of bitterness. As for the skeptics concerned with the ""netted"" base of the cup affecting taste and freshness...the product is packaged in mini packs ( sealed thick plastic) of 8 cups to protect freshness. In addition, I feel the netting (not flimsy by any means) offers a better fitration system that the typical K cup. I only write reviews about products that excite me, or repulse me. Obviously, I am a San Francisco Bay Coffee fan. If you choose to try this product, I'm pretty sure you will be pleasantly surprised."
1,"I decided to give these a try based on the price, the favorable reviews here on Amazon, and its sales rank in the K-cup store.  I was not disappointed as this is a strong, but not too strong, good-tasting coffee that not only tastes great but has a nice aroma.<br /><br />The pods are a little different than your traditional plastic K-cup portion as, instead of any plastic around the sides or bottom you have basically a mesh coffee filter holding the coffee grounds.  This appears to make a more complete brew, and allows more of the flavor to come into the actual coffee.  You will see a dirty residue at the bottom of your cup due to this filtration system vs. a ""clean"" look from a normal K-cup pod.  This seems to make sense as the normal K-cup pod has all of the brewed coffee escaping through the pinprick hole vs. the full brewing experience of these pods.<br /><br />As the pods are in this filtration medium the coffee is not air-tight sealed after you open the package of pods.  I have put the unused ones in a sealed Ziploc bag to keep them fresh.<br /><br />I also shared this with some folks in the office, who liked it so much they ordered their own so it's not just me who likes this stuff.  Who knows, I may have found a new favorite coffee!"
1,"SF Bay Coffee's Fog Chaser was a nice ""bold"" surprise.  I am a big fan of Amazon's Subscribe & Save program and have been getting my K-cups this way for over a year.  Of course, once you find one you absolutely love (Timothy's World Midnight Magic), poof!  The Magic's gone!  Midnight Magic is still available on Amazon, though no longer offered through Subscribe & Save, and I refuse to pay $35 for 48 K-cups of any brand.  S & S now offers SF Bay Coffee's Fog Chaser and based on the quantity of favorable reviews, I decided to give it a shot.  The pods are far different than what we've all been used to, but they work like a charm, have less waste, and deliver a pretty bold, smooth cup of coffee.  My morning coffee always consists of two pods at the 6 oz. setting each for one eye-opening 12 oz. mug of coffee.  On that setting, Fog Chaser lives up to its name.  I have noticed some residue occasionally, but it certainly is minimal.  The pods come packed in plastic bags (12 pods/bag).  Once cut open, I just fold over the edge, clip it and store the bag in the fridge.  Strength is a personal decision, and to me, more than 6 oz. of water with ANY pod is too weak.  If you are a fan of Rev of Jet Fuel, this coffee is comparable."
1,This coffee was really good Fogchaser will get you going. It's a strong bold cup of coffee.  This cofee is valued price with a great taste!
1,"Decided to give these a try based on price.  The coffee tastes great but since the 'cups' don't have the plastic bottoms (a filter element), we had to store in a sealed jar to keep them fresh and not have the coffee bean smell thru-out the house.  (or you could use a plastic ziploc - original bag was not re-sealable).  They did one thing finally right - you don't have to pay MORE for going green when buying LESS packaging.  Kudos."
1,"My new favorite!  A few Gr. Mtn. are great: Br. Blend, Half/Caff especially.  Most other brands are more like Folgers than real flavor brews.  How do I get free shipping?"
1,i dont no what the big fuss is about a lot of bad reviews but if u read the description you shoulld no it comes revealed and not in plastic like regualr kcups anyhow i ordered the fogchaser and they were great i amade iced coffee with mine and the flavor was perfect i just keep it in some tupperware to keep fresh is all i plan on buying all 3 flavors and encourage they should come out with even more flavors the price is awsome beats paying 15 bucks for 18 kucps when i just paid 14 for 36 kcups i will def keep on buying these
1,The price was the initial reason for my purchase but I would have to say now that my reorder is based on the taste. Coffee is very rich and fresh tasting even without the sealed k-cup design. I will continue to reorder if the price stays down under the other k-cups.
1,"Fog Chaser has a very good flavor, and it is reasonably strong especially for a K-Cup.  I like it better than their French Roast version, which seems stronger but more harsh to me; and I like very strong coffee.  Their Rainforest version has a more mellow taste that is also very good, but it is weaker strength than Fog Chaser.  The price for any of the versions, especially for the ""subscribe and save"", is very good.  The packaging, which is a box of 3 sealed bags of 12 is fine to deal with; once you open a sealed bag (you can't reseal the bag), just use a ziplock to seal the remainder for the week."
1,"I have been a picky Keurig fan for about ten years, have always bought my coffee from either onegreatcup or amazon (because stores just don't have the selection), and until now had settled on Jet Fuel as my favorite -- just so you know what I like. FogChaser is in that league: rich, deep, dark, zesty, overall INTERESTING and best of all (unlike the plastic-bottomed K-cups) brewing it makes my kitchen smell good again. I'm putting it on subscription.  A good find; a keeper -- glad I tried it."
0,"25 lbs. of hard licorice pieces were dumped into kitchen trash bags, unsealed, then put into a cardboard box.  The most disgusting, unsanitary packaging I've ever seen.  I tossed the entire thing in the trash.<br />To top it off, the first ingredient in the whole thing was corn syrup.  Yuk.<br />Avoid like the plague."
1,"Our nine-month-old daughter is ready for a more substantial breakfast than plain cereals.  We want her to get the nutrients and vitamins she needs (especially iron), so plain fruit or vegetables aren't enough.  This blend of fruit and grains (and, in some cases, yogurt) provides everything she needs for a good breakfast and keeps her full for several hours.  Plus, the flavors are not overly sweet.  One note:  at least two of these flavors include yogurt.  Some babies younger than 1-year may have a reaction to yogurt and other dairy foods, so just watch out for that."
1,"We feed our baby this Wholesome Breakfast at any time of the day, not just for breakfast.  We're happy she's getting a good balance of vitamins and minerals.  Most jarred baby food is pretty light on the calories and nutrition, but the plain cereals that are fortified with essential vitamins/minerals are so boring and don't train a baby to enjoy different flavors.  We've been mixing cereal into our baby's food to enhance the nutrition, but that's inconvenient and messy.  This Wholesome Breakfast provides the best of both worlds:  the vitamins/minerals of a fortified cereal but with the stronger flavors of a real food.  We particularly like that this food contains yogurt.  When she was young (~6 months old), our baby loved yogurt but couldn't eat it plain because it would cause a rash around her mouth.  She was never bothered by the yogurt in this food, though, perhaps because it was mixed with other things.  Now that she's older (10 months), our baby can eat all the yogurt she wants without a skin reaction, but for awhile, this variety of Wholesome Breakfast was the only source of her favorite food."
1,"We're not sure why, but this this flavor of Earth's Best Wholesome Breakfast (Peach, Pear, and Barley) is our baby's favorite flavor.  She'll eat this any time of the day, and we're happy she's getting a good balance of vitamins and minerals.  Most jarred baby food is pretty light on the calories and nutrition, but the plain cereals that are fortified with essential vitamins/minerals are so boring and don't train a baby to enjoy different flavors.  We've been mixing cereal into our baby's food to enhance the nutrition, but that's inconvenient and messy.  This Wholesome Breakfast provides the best of both worlds:  the vitamins/minerals of a fortified cereal but with the stronger flavors of a real food.  Also, our baby is a picky eater, so we're thrilled to find something she likes that's more substantial than Puffs!"
1,"My daughter loves the entire Earths Best line.  I taste everything before I feed it to her and each item tastes pure and fresh.  Very happy.  We've tasted other popular name brands, and Earths Best is really good in comparison."
1,"My son is lactose intolerant but he's able to eat this for some reason!  Moreover, it's great to start off a day with a nutritious meal versus eating empty calaries with little to no nutritional benefit.  Regardless, I'm very pleased with the quality and taste.  Yes, I tasted this and it is delish!"
1,"My little guy just loves this jar. I love the line of breakfast blends.  I am happy with Amazon's ""grocery"" business. It is great to have the convenience to order these on-line and have home delivery.  I can't imagine going the store and having to get a whole case and go through check out. I try to make him some meals, but I trust Earth's Best and love the flavor combo's and they are so convenient."
1,I tried all kinds of oatmeal to give my LO but this is her favorite one. I also love the fact that it comes on time.
1,If I had only figured out to order baby food online before.  The price is right on the money and the convenience of the shipping to the house is great.  No need to go to the store and have baby jars flying all over the cart.  This flavor is my baby's favorite.  It's a go to when she is not in the mood for anything else.
0,"I love Earth's Best products and only use them to feed my baby, besides home made foods. I rate this one one star because the seller didn't specify that this product contains milk, which my baby cannot tolerate since he is lactose-intolerant. So for us, it was a waste of money, and I bought two packs..."
0,"This baby food, labeled for 6+ months, contains heavy cream. My baby could not digest it; we had a very bad day. Maybe I missed that in the description, but in any case, everywhere I've read and according to my pediatrician, you're supposed to avoid cow's milk products before age 1 (why they make formula using cow's milk and not a much more digestible milk like goat baffles me and is a rant for another time--my son drinks the lactose free kind, in any case). I ordered another variety of ""Wholesome breakfast"" too: Pear, Apple, Oatmeal. Same thing there. I'm guessing they all have heavy cream in them."
1,"My daughter likes it now, but when she was younger she did not want to have it! Go figure! Now she is almost 14 months she digs the flavor."
0,My son hated it. I tasted some and saw why. It's tart and the barley gives it a weird smell and flavor. Yuck!
0,I wish Amazon would include a list of ingredients on baby food in bulk. This has cream in it and my baby has a cow's milk intolerance. I had already opened the jar when I read the ingredients and now I'm stuck with 15 jars of food I can't use. So disappointing.
1,I bought quite a lot of these in the past. My son loved them. I like the fact that they are organic and the combination of fruits and vegetables in them is just right.
1,"We do fruit and cereal for breakfast daily.  This comes in handy when we are on the go, since i dont have to bring cereal long.  I also like that it is 4.5 ounces, since some of the earth's best fruit and cereal combos are only 4 ounces."
1,My son eats these for breakfast every morning and he seems to really enjoy them. It is a nice alternative to fruit and rice cereal and it has all the nourishment my son needs to start his day.
1,"Price was great, variety, flavor was good, baby likes it! She takes a while to eat, but it's safe and clean to leave in the refrigerator."
1,Great baby foods!  I like the variety pack.  Much cheaper than buying it from the local grocers or co-op!  I Just wish they came in the squeezie pouches!
1,"Right combination. We originally thought our baby had some allergies. However, as we fed these food baby got used to them and she liked them all."
1,"Little one loves these and glass is recyclable forever which plastic (Gerber) is not. About the same price, food is healthier and she's more likely to eat this stuff."
1,"We love the organic baby food. It costs just a small amount more, but it is totally worth it.  Our son loves the different choices."
1,I love how it's thicker than other Stage 2 baby food. My son gobbles it down! Way better than the lunch or dinner varities!
1,"This was by far my daughters favorite Earth's Best breakfast.  It's nice that it contains organic fruit and whole grains.  Plus the prices on amazon can't be beat, especially with subscribe and save!"
1,"This is one of my sons favorites. Even though it's called ""wholesome breakfast"" he usually has this for lunch. It is packed with nutrients, including 35% of his daily iron. This is a staple in our baby's diet!"
1,We initially tried few sample from Ralph's and our Baby started liking it .. We don't give formula to our Baby and we give only Mom's milk.<br />i think when we combine that with this wholesome breakfast you will have a satisfaction that you are really taking a good care of the Baby..<br />What's more it had got more calories than the regular baby foods and it had got 35% iron which i consider important.. It has dates in it. Very few baby foods for breakfast have dates in them.. on the whole it's really a wholesome breakfast.. Add organic on top of that what else can you ask for.. I had only one thing to complain about.. it's availability is rare.. i had to wait for a month to get it.. I don't find it in the store shelves either..

1,I enjoy most of the Yogi teas but this particular one tastes almost sinful. I don't know that it necessarily tastes a lot like vanilla or hazelnut but it has a very delicious spicy taste.
1,"The title above refers not only to a semi-obscure Damon Runyan-based movie with Bob Hope (we ALL knew that), but to these classic lemon drops with a truly international pedigree:<br /><br />Made in Spain; owned by the French(Cadbury France, located at 143 Boulevard Romain Rolland, Paris; imported by New Jersey's own ""Euro-American Brands,"" Paramus, NJ  07652.<br /><br />All the way from Paris to your local candy seller or movie theater (which is where I experieced my first taste of La Vie en Lemon).  They were everything a lemon drop should be: A sugary entrance, developing into a deeply satisfying, soul-stirring essence of pure lemon. The mouth-watering joy of the lemon drop is seductive and addictive, and I am nearly certain that sucking on these golden gems made Kurosawa's ""Savage Dogs"" even more enjoyable.<br /><br />They're hard candies. but not so hard that you couldn't cheat and bite into one, breaking it up into ten or so smaller candies, zig-zagging around your mouth like offshoots from a single magnificent fireworks explosion.<br /><br />One 2-ounce tin lasted longer than the 2 hours or so of Kurosawa's brilliant detective drama, one of his first with Toshiro Mifune, who once again delivers a compelling performance.  Although the packaging is a bit precious, there's nothing pretentious about the taste of Les Citrons, and as for value, these drops are the working man or woman's workhorse.  They're far less expensive than other candy (to say nothing of popcorn), and their staying power is extraordinary.<br /><br />Still, this vendor charges more than some others, and with the added shipping fee one may wish to purchase these  at a local outlet (or occupying it until your lemon drop demands are met). If you're serious about your lemon drops, tt's Paris 1968 all over again.<br /><br />Nutritional Information per Package (30 pieces; you could try to eat the suggested serving size of 3 drops, but I find this highly unlikely). 240 calories, no fat or sodium, 60 grams carbohydrates, 60 grams of sugar, no protein, and no trace of food allerges.

1,"I bought 4 high end dry foods that my miniature poodle simply would not eat. I tried mixing it with canned food and broth, but she'd lick off the canned food and leave the kibble. I was worried that she wasn't getting the nutrients she needed. Then I found Utramix and I am thrilled. She loves it, actually cleans her bowl. I merely drizzle a little warm water on it since I'm no longer mixing in canned food and she gobbles it up. There are chunks of bananas, peas, carrots, etc. that she seems to love. The mix even contains probiotics. Highly recommended."

1,"Some years ago my husband and I were lucky enough to visit Ireland several times. While there we discovered Bewley's Tea Shop in Dublin, and also their Irish Afternoon Tea. It was better than any other tea I have ever had -- and I am a committed tea drinker. The 'finish' is incredibly smooth, with just the right 'body' for an afternoon pick me up.<br /><br />We bought several boxes to take home in our suitcases;then when we ran out, we had coworkers who were going to Ireland bring more of it back to us. When our Irish trips ended and our sources dried up, we were truly disheartened, since we had only found it in one location in the States [a little tea shop in Alexandria, Virginia.]<br /><br />When I found out that it is now available through Amazon/Sullivan's I was elated and placed my order that day. Unfortunately I didn't see that the large box of it [80] teabags would soon be available until after I had placed my order for smaller boxes. The large boxes are a MUCH better value [80 teabags for $8.99 as oppossed to 25 teabags for $5.99]. That is certainly the way I will order in the future. But I'm delighted to find a source for Bewley's teas, especially Irish Afternoon. And I am anxious to try the Dublin Morning tea, which I also ordered.  Happy Nonnie!"
1,About 10 years ago while visiting disneyworld in orlando florida my wife and I met a nice english couple. Being a tea drinker I inquired about good english teas and they gave me a napkin with the names of bewleys tea on it and about 6 teabags for me to try. I put the napkin in my back pocket and the teabags got wrapped up in an old sandwich bag and put in my wife's purse. We parted with the nice english couple and as we traveled around disneyworld it began to rain that afternoon and we got soaking wet. I found what was left of the napkin that evening at the hotel and it was unreadable. About 6 months later at home the bag fell out of my tea closet as i was fixing to make a cup and I decided to finally try the tea those nice folks from england raved about. I loved the tea and I believe I have finally found it in bewleys. Some of the best tea I have had. The english surely know their tea.
1,"So far, my all time favorite teas come from Bewley's. Not quite as strong as PG Tips (i like that too, but a bit of a kick). This tea is more rounded out than Lipton and stronger. A wonderful flavor. -- Those Irish have got it going on!"
1,"I have been drinking Taylors of Harrogate, Yorkshire Gold Tea until I tried Bewley's.  I have always like my tea very strong using double the amount of most people.  I drink it with cream and sugar and this tea is perfect for me.  I do not have to put in extra because it is full bodied and stands up to cream and sugar wonderfully.  I have been drinking it in the morning and have been using the Yorkshire Gold for the afternoon. Bewley's is my favorite now, not that Yorkshire Gold sucks or anything but I like it strong.  I will still search for another tea perhaps as good. Life is an adventure and you never know when you're going to bingo.<br /><br />If you like a strong, not bitter brew try Bewley's!  After you've had Irish it is hard to go back, teawise that is."
0,"Recently purchased these treats for my 4 dogs from local grocery store. After giving my dogs these chews, my 3 month old puppy threw up the treat. By the next day at lunch time, he was exhibiting neurotoxic symptoms. We immediately took him to the vet for blood work, which all came back below normal limits. He was given IV therapy and monitored over night. Over the next two days, my older dogs (ages 4, 7 and 9)began vomiting and acting lethargic, but with no neurological symptoms. We traced the cause back to these chews, as it is the only coomon thing among all the dogs (puppy eats different food than adult dogs, puppy is walked on a leash not allowed to run around in yard yet, puppy is not out of his crate unless he is beig observed, etc.). After speaking with someone at a pet store, we learned some rawhide chews are pressed with water, while others are pressed with formaldehyde. While it is not listed which method these use, we are concerned it is the formaldehyde. In the case of the older dogs, their GIs are rejecting them due to the toxins. With the puppy, his immature renal and hepatic system exhibited neurotoxicity."
1,"I ordered these tails a while back for my Parents to be shipped to St. George, Utah. The customer service and express shipping were excellent. The tails were recieved on time and still frozen. The best part is the tails are very large and sometimes from other sources, I have recieved tails this size that were ""Soft"" and not firm meat. These were fantastic and were saved up to 3-4 months with a couple retrived from the freezer and broiled....perfectly every time..Thank<br />s for the great product and service!!"
0,"I confirm another review here that perfectly describes the texture and taste of this product as like chewing on a cellulose sponge! OMG! I love tofu, by the way. This is the first tofu I've eaten in decades that I did not like.<br /><br />I bought this after reading that review and thinking the person was maybe not familiar with the taste of tofu, or perhaps tried to eat this without re-hydrating this first. No, it is like chewing on a sponge (Have we all by accident done this, or is it an early childhood memory of times when we tested everything with our mouths?) At any rate, you will instantly think ""sponge"" if you ignore these warnings and buy this tofu. I do not mean just the texture, it really tastes like a cellulose sponge!<br /><br />I am also a fan of Eden Foods and enjoy many of their products, they make great tamari, for instance. I was looking for that texture and taste I find in freeze dried tofu pieces that come in soup mixes as in instant miso tofu soup packets or soup cups. This isn't that tofu! It will not be wasted, it has good protein and I can chop it in very small pieces and mix it with Creamy Tomato Soup by Pacific Naturals, that makes it innocuous enough. But I'll never buy this again!<br /><br />I am looking into buying a food dehydrator to make my own. The cost of tofu is much lower that this item reflects. I will update this if I have success drying my own tofu. Believe the reviews here, this isn't good."
0,"If you feel compelled to buy this, get it from Whole Foods so you don't waste money buying the 6 pack. Buyer beware that you cannot return many food items. The texture of this after rehydration was like a cellulose sponge.If you must have dehydrated tofu for hiking or camping trips, make your own or buy the tofu in the sealed boxes.  On the flip side, I love many of Eden products but this was a waste of my money."
1,"Koya Dofu, or freeze-dried tofu, requires a specific approach to cooking. It not only has to be rehydrated in a particular way, but also will not taste good without proper cooking to flavor and soften it. Even at that point, it will have a chewy, slightly spongey texture, but if cut and cooked appropriately, it is not a strange texture and is very delicious as a side dish.<br /><br />Google recipes for Koyadofu and try one that involves simmering it (after rehydration) in a broth made of katsuobushi (if you are not vegetarian -- if you are, then use mushroom or vegie stock), shouyu or tamari, mirin, and a little sweetner. My child loves this, and I pack it in her school lunch box along with rice, and some vegies that have been simmered in the same broth."
1,"I've tried almost every ground coffee there is, and I have to say that Melitta French Vanilla (and Hazelnut) is the best tasting coffee ever.  You don't have to use a lot of coffee, so the can lasts longer than leading brands.  The taste is a non-powerful, strong blend with a subtle vanilla.  Even when the coffee is brewing it's out of this world!<br /><br />Amazon has a great price for this item.  WHEN my store has it on sale, they ask $4.89 for a can, so this is a nice price plus the wonderful free shipping offer.  I received my coffee two days after I ordered it!  I will now add this to the list of groceries I now order through Amazon.<br /><br />Highly recommend you to try this coffee and see if you agree too!"
1,"This coffee is nice and strong, but not bitter. Buttery smooth and just the right touch of vanilla."
0,"We'd been buying the four-pack of Melitta French Vanilla coffee once a month for the past 2 years. We won't be any more. In the last month they changed their packaging, which is fine, but also changed the grind. All of a sudden, these four packs come in ""extra fine grind,"" which simply doesn't work well at all in our drip coffee maker. The whole pot tastes weak until you get to the last couple of cups, which taste more like mud because all of the coffee has settled. Here's hoping they switch back at some point, because this is just bad."
1,"When it comes down to so many Americans, they are right now skipping going to Starbucks to get their favorite flavor of coffee and lattes, and having them right at home. Fortunately, Melitta knows that feeling with their coffees, and make them well from the heart. Their French Vanilla is a delightful tast that just melts your heart away. It is delicious after the first cup, and just everlasting. My one and only gripe with Melitta though is that with their ground coffees is that they are very hard to open the cans, considering you'd have to use a regular can opener to get them open, rather than peel the top off from Folgers or Maxwell House. That definitely is the only thing that is not only frustrarting, but can easily cause the consumer to break the can. Still, the taste is great and if you want a nice soulfully delightful cup of joe, Melitta can take you there.<br /><br />Price: B-<br /><br />Taste: A-<br /><br />Convience: B-<br /><br />Overall: B"
1,"If you love good medium-roasted and well balanced coffee then you will love Melitta.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1. Melitta only uses the top 2% of the world's supply of 100% Arabica coffee and it tastes it. (and NO, I don't work for the company!) Arabica is the finest grade of coffee available on the market.  The other grade, ""Robusto"" is generally less expensive, lower quality and used by most other major coffee processors such as Chock Full O' Nuts, Folgers, Maxwell House and almost all generic and store brands to name a few).<br /><br />2. The 11.5 oz. cans are nitrogen-flushed and well-sealed to retain its integrity and fresh roasted flavor upon opening. I have found consistently that coffee packaged in plastic or paper bags or pouches DOES NOT, in my opinion, retain its flavor and freshness well.<br /><br />3. If you have a drip coffee maker (Like Bunn, Mr. Coffee or others), Melitta's fine grind works exceptionally well. Remember...the finer the grind, the more flavor you will extract from the coffee. In addition, the finer the grind, the more efficiently your coffee maker will use coffee. Since you can generally use less coffee per cup, Melitta is a winner for price per ounce.<br /><br />4. Melitta seems to be a very transparent and consumer responsible company. They place clear ""Best By"" dates on the bottom of each of their products.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1. Some of Melitta's flavors, like French Vanilla and a seasonally-offered coffee called ""Morning Decadence"", are very hard to find but well worth investigating and sampling if you have a chance.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />The best commercially available coffee for drip coffee makers. Outstanding grind, well-balanced flavors and consistent freshness can after can."
1,"First of all, 10 days ago Amazon ran this coffee on a great special, about $4.70 per pound.  This was my first try; I should have bought more because Amazon has about doubled the price in less than two weeks.  This is a medium blend and grind as advertised.  The top is tightly sealed; it was the hardest pull off top that I've ever encountered, and you could hear the air express as it was opened.  The aroma is great in the can, when brewing, and in the cup. The taste is, for me, somewhat artificial although not obnoxious, but it cost a star in my book.  There is no residual acidity or aftertaste.  The expiration date is fine, at May 2012; it won't last anywhere near that long."
1,"Excellent coffee, great price, delivered to my door. The subscription program is flexible so you can buy sooner or push back the delivery dates. What else can you ask for!"
1,"I have been a big Starbucks fan for a long time now, but thought I would try something that I could do the subscribe and save deal on. I chose this one because of the great reviews and thought it would make a change to have a flavored coffee. I am so glad I did! I love it. It is so smooth and the aroma when you open the can is wonderful. Can't wait to try the other types of Melitta coffee now too."
1,"We use this in our Keurig coffee machine in the reusable filter.  Comes out great every time, just make sure not to fill past the line."
1,Yes the coffee is good but why do you raise the price without letting anyone know??  I expect 1 price to be debited from my account and then the price goes up $5 without warning or notice!  Not Cool!
1,"I was a little apprehensive about ordering coffee online.  I had never heard of this brand, but to my delight, it is absolutely delicious.  I love it and my husband enjoys the Vanilla and also one of the other blends.  I would recommend if you are fan of any flavored coffee."
1,"I love it! Great smell and exceptional taste! I've tried lot of different sorts/tastes of coffee from cheap to exclusively expensive, but this one remains one of my faorite for years.<br />Great Coffee! Worth to try and you will not be disappointed!"
1,"The Melitta French Vanilla has been a hit with both family and with guests. Great aroma, balanced and smooth coffee with a rich taste. We ordered more to give as gifts and ordered other Melitta blends because we were so impressed with this one and like changing our coffee every week or so."
0,I thought these were going to be the same size as the ones in the grocery store. I found they were smaller and more expensive to buy online then if I just bought the bigger ones for 99 cents each at the grocery store.
1,"We got a super deal (under $12) on this box of Twix King Size candy, so I can't really complain... BUT the caramel was a tad harder/chewier than it should be for fresh bars. Perhaps they were clearancing them out."
0,"$23.52 for ten pounds of these beans???  I just bought a bag of these at Sam's Club for $8.95.  If you want to pay nearly 4 times the going rate, by ALL MEANS, purchase this!  Seriously, how STUPID would a person need to be to pay $2.53 for a pound of dried beans?"
1,"but WHY would you package the product into four separate pouches (which I love) and have a nutrition label say the box contains ""about 10 servings""???? I may agree that one pouch is enough for two small servings, great with milk warmed up by the way, but how do you get 2 1/4 servings from a pouch?"
1,I like variety in my gf cereals and this granola is a nice addition to my shelf. The granola comes in packets inside the box so it is handy for travel. It's sweet but not too sweet. I eat it in a bowl with milk and it is just the right amount. Granola is more dense so a portion is smaller than a bowl full of cereal.
1,"I've been eating Glutenfreeda's Granola for breakfast the past two months and I love it!<br />especially the individual packaging, keeps it fresh."
1,Glutenfreeda's gluten free granola is an ideal breakfast food for people who have to eat gluten free.  It also makes an on the road snack that is easy to pack in your purse or carry on luggage.  The oats in it are guarrenteed to be gluten free.
0,Although this coffee tastes fine there is nowhere enough coffee in the pod.  The cup that is brewed even with a smaller amount of water is weak and watery.
1,The Parisian Cafe blend is wonderful but it is too thick to fit correctly in the Senseo machine.  The box advertises universal fit but it is not.
1,"Coffee has a great flavor and is not too acidic. Fits perfectly in out ""Juan Valdez"" pod maker that was purchased at Target several years ago! So hard to find these so was glad to find them on Amazon!"
1,"Smooth coffee, but a bit to big for senseo, interestingly all the other Melitta One pod flavors fit just fine in senseo, my fav are french kisses and vanilla haze."
0,My husband didn't care for this coffee at all.  He complained it lacked flavor and aroma.
1,"We love Melitta coffee pods.  Makes a perfect cup of coffee every time. The coffee is always delicious, even the decaf blend!  If you have a coffee pod machine, try all of their blends...they're great!"
1,I love coffee and at night really miss out if I don't have the decaff.
1,"This decaf pod has wonderful flavor.  It is much better than their previous decaf ""Skip the Buzz"".  I'm glad they upgraded their product."
1,"I had bought a Black and Decker one-cup coffee maker that used these pods.  It didn't work properly, but I have managed to use the pods with my old, stand-by coffee maker and am please with the flavor and convenience.  Someone had commented about a problem with some of the pods being sealed in the outer packaging.  I have not encountered that problem.  Overall, I am pleased with this purchase."
1,"My mom has the Hamilton Beach single cup coffee maker and was using Senseo pods in it. They were too strong / bitter for her and I was searching for something else.  Found these and Wolfgang Puck's and decided to get both for her.  These Melitta Breakfast Blend pods are her favorite! She says they have a smooth taste and great flavor. Granted, neither of us would ever be mistaken for a coffee judge by anyone (I don't even drink coffee so my opinion means nothing), but she really likes these and is happy to have them."
0,To make a decent cup of coffee I have to use two pods at a time. I prefer a strong cup of coffee even if it IS decaf.<br />What happened to Senseo decaf?
1,this was delicious coffee for a great price which i could not find at any store in my area or areas nearby
1,Enjoying my Java Pods very much. Easy and fast. Medium strong to wake me up. I get positive comments on the convenience of making coffee.
0,"This coffee .<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M0508Y"">Melitta One:One Java Pods,Breakfast Blend Coffee, 18-Count Pods (Pack of 4)</a> is terrible. Cheap beans, bad roast, whatever, my lot actually tastes like it is moldy. Maybe I just got a bad batch. I have tried the Buzzworthy dark roast Melitta Pods and they are drinkable, even though I prefer medium roast coffees. Suggest you try one box of these, not the 4 box lot I'm stuck with. Also, to help you evaluate this response better, you should know that I like quality roast Kenya AA or Sumatra or Columbian Supremo, etc. rich flavor type coffees. I don't like Folgers, Maxwell House, pedestrian type blends, but even those are way better than this coffee."
1,Melitta Pods are an inexpensive alternative to k-cups  that also save in the amount of material you have to throw away. Buyer Beware: Pods vary GREATLY in the amount of coffee they have in them. These allow for a good size cup of coffee.
0,"I have a Melitta One:One machine and have been using Juan Valdez pods in it.  When I ran out I searched for pods for it & only came up with these Melitta-brand ones. I figured (incorrectly) that the others weren't available & purchased these. VERY disappointing.  My coffee had been nice, strong & tasty, but coffee made with these is weak & tasteless.  I bought a 4-box package of three different types & am now stuck with them. Forget these & head to Juan Valdez (same price range) unless you like weak coffee."
1,I've been using these for a couple of years now. I highly recommend these if you only need 1 cup of coffee.
1,This is one of the best decaf coffee's I have ever had.  I was ordering this product from another website but found that Amazon's subscribe and safe plan is the most economical.  Great Product.
1,"If there happens to be one thing I definitely love, and that happens to be coffee. It is one of my favorite drinks in the world, and I absolutely love the smell and taste of Folgers. This coffee is one of the nicest tasting coffees ever. I still don't know why people always buy ground, rather than instant like this edition. Nevertheless, it is worth buying. Bottoms Up!"
1,just the greatest thing when you have your favorite coffee at such a fair price deliverd right to your door :) I will be doing this again. Thank you !
1,"I just had to let you know what a miracle this food has been for me and my dogs!  I have four Chihuahuas of my own and a fifth as a foster, and I spent a long time researching foods to make a switch after P&G took over Natura (we were on Innova).  My female can be picky and does horribly with food pieces that are too big, so I was thrilled when I saw the thin triangles in the bag.  She happily crunches right through them, which is great, since she and one of my boys have horrible teeth and having to chew the food helps.<br /><br />My alpha male has been on Hills C/D almost all his life because he was diagnosed with struvite crystals as a young dog (he is almost 11 now).  He was the only one of my pack who looked old.  Dull coat, dandruff, and a gaunt look to his face and body.  I knew it had to be the food, so looked at all the levels and decided on the Whitefish formula as a food trial, hoping he wouldn't develop crystals again on a hollistic food.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  He looks fantastic, he and the female (same age) are more active, and I'm happy to report that after 2.5 months, his urinalysis was clean!<br /><br />Our third dog and our foster dog both have very course hair, and since starting this food, they have both become much softer.  Everyone is shiny and (before the weather got so dry) dandruff-free!  Best of all, each and every one of the dogs is absolutely CRAZY about the taste of the food, and even my girl who we used to have to push to finish her dinner now eats with everyone else in under two minutes and then licks the crumbs up off her eating blanket.  It's truly miraculous.  I couldn't be any happier with this food.  It may cost more than the lower quality foods, but if you added all the supplements it would take to get this level of nutrition, you'd be spending more anyway.  Love it, love it, LOVE IT!"
1,"I only buy Fromm for my dog. He loves it and I feel good about feeding it to him.  No fillers, the first ingredient is meat/fish.  This seller had a more than fair price and shipping was faster than I expected.  I would definitely buy from them again!"
1,This product is great!  I can't seem to find it locally at my pet food stores and it's worth feeding my pet the best!!  Super fast delivery from this seller!
1,"The hazelnut flavor is unique.  I'm glad Amazon has decided to carry them, because they are hard to find locally."
1,"If you've never tried Kona coffee, Aloha Island is definitely the one to start with.  <p>Kona coffee is grown in the Kona district of the Big Island and regarded by some to be the best coffee in the world.  I'm not a coffee aficionado by any means, but you can taste the difference with Kona coffee - it's full and rich and almost mocha-ish.  I always reserve Kona for lazy weekend brunches or to serve with dessert after a lovely dinner.  <p>Aloha Island operates the only quality management program in Kona, so their coffees are certified as 100% Kona.  Which just means that you're guaranteed to get quality Kona coffee if you order from them. <p>Keep in mind that Aloha Island has three grades of Kona coffee that they sell - gold, platinum, and diamond (which is supposed to be their private reserve).  Obviously, it gets more expensive as you go up the ladder.  The gold is very good and a great place to start sampling their fare."
1,"Hands down this is absolutely the best kona coffee I have ever had in my life..This is the smoothest and richest coffee you will ever have...Go ahead and spoil yourself, you'll be glad you did!!"
1,"The aroma from a pot of this coffee is earthy and heavenly at the same time. Everything about this product--packaging, texture, and taste--tells you that it was lovlngly produced under rigid standards. Moreover,if you've tried a lot of ""kona"" coffees like I have, you know how widely the taste and quality can vary. This is the coffee you serve to the treasured few in your life who really appreciate the finest."
1,"I can see why plenty of people will think this is the best coffee ever. It's some of the smoothest, least bitter coffee I've ever tasted. The aroma is also delicious. Opening the bag and taking a whiff right away is a must if you want to try this.<br /><br />But I'm the type of coffee drinker who loves it black, so I need a coffee with a rich flavour on its own. I don't wanter bitterness, but I love coffee with kick to it.<br /><br />I'd call it too mild but that's kind of oversimplifying it. It's worth a try to make up your own mind though."
0,"Aloha Island Coffee Company Bonzai Pipeline Dark Roast is a very mediocre, insipid coffee, rather acidic for a dark roast. The beans are of unknown origin, but if there are any Kona beans in this anonymous mix, they must be the ones other roasters threw out as it doesn't even vaguely taste like Kona. Actually, Aloha Island Coffee Co. isn't even in Hawaii, it's located in Santa Ana, CA, an area not exactly known for great coffee. The coffee is extremely overpriced for the poor quality you get, which is why I gave it one star, and you would be better off buying some of the better brands commonly sold in supermarkets at about one-third the price. I ordered the 2-8 oz bags, but I couldn't even make it through the first one and have thrown the second in the garbage. I would never buy anything from Aloha Island Coffee company again."
1,"I'm more of a tea drinker but occasionally want something different and I like this to keep me up or wake me up too. So, keep in mind I haven't tasted lots of coffees. I find most coffees bitter and gross, like starbucks or whatever my mom buys. With some splenda I actually enjoy this, so even if you don't like coffee give this a try. It's definitely one of the better one."
1,"This coffee is the absolute best.  I found it by accident a couple of months ago and now I can not have any other kind of coffee.  It may be more expensive than some, but well worth it.  Plus, you aren't going to want to go out to Starbucks anymore!  Manufacturer ships quickly too!"
1,I'm not a fan of Senseo brand coffee pods so I've been using espresso pods from Green Mountain (not great but way better then senseo) for some reason they quit making them so I was searching for pods that fit the Senseo after reading the review I took a shot in the dark and ordered a box of them from Amazon and fell in Love I use them with the espresso pod holder I got from amazon (not the single pod holder that comes stock)and have been enjoying the best espresso I've had in years.  I liked them so well I just ordered 2 more boxes
1,"You wake up early on a sunday morning and you turn on your other side because you want to sleep a little more. But then you smell something like scrambled eggs, fried oignon rings and above all the strong scent of espresso...<br /><br />This is strong coffee like the Italian espresso. Take care you don't boil the water, otherwise it will loses its flavor. The water should be between warm and hot. I use it black with a small lump of brown sugar. A real amateur will tell you that the use of any sugar is sacrilege. But what can I do? The flesh is weak."
1,Pretty good coffee I really liked it<br />It is a bit on the strong side or it may be the way I brewed it but it is a good tasting coffee in my opinion.
0,"Product looked and smelled great - however, it was not clear from the description that this product is for non-ESE pod machines. I like the idea of organic and US source, this just didn't work for me."
1,"Coffee from Hawaii is the best in the world, specificly the Kona side of the island and this is no exception."
1,This was purchased for my daughter and her husband.  I was very pleased with the selection of items in the basket.
1,"These crackers make a handy quick snack on the go or at my desk.  I do wish that the mix was four of the cheese filled crackers and four peanut butter rather than two cheese and six peanut butter, which is why I only gave it four stars.  But I like the taste and convenience so much that I have this on auto-ship monthly.  And I like having some variety, which is why I order the variety pack instead of all the same flavor."
1,love these little crackers and a great price on these will be ordering from this vendor again expiration on these was bout 6 months away
1,My husband is in a Physical Rehab facility and these crackers make a great snack for him in between meals or with medications he can't take on an empty stomach.  He also takes one along when he has to travel to other facilities for treatment in case he gets hungry on the road.  Just wish there was one more variety instead of two of the toasted ones.
1,Fast delivery by Amazon.<br /><br />I've always liked Keebler products and think these are good. I use them for a quick easy feed. My dog also likes them and recommends them to other dogs.
1,Purchased this product after extensive research on coca tea and reviews from others on various brands. Upon arrival I made a cup for my overly tired feeling sick husband. After drinking the tea (two bags in 8oz) he said he felt alert and more awake. He was easily able to finish his day. He said it tasted good (no sugar or honey) and he usually does not like anything natural.
1,I personally have not tried this tea. I bought this as a Teacher's Appreiciation gift for my sons' teacher. She had mentioned trying this flavor at a tea shop years before. So I searched for it and hoped that this would be a winner. And it was!! She loved it!!!
1,"This is the best iced tea around!  The first time I had it was at Emeril's Tchoup Chop in Orlando.  It tastes great, but I think the aroma while it brews is the best part."
1,"Just had this for the first time at PF Chang's in Sacramento yesterday.  I was utterly amazed at how good it is and I am a tough critic, having been a long-time Earl Grey lover.  It's great with food because the taste is light and refreshing; it's also delicious, by the way.  It's perfect for summertime, perfect frosty cold with lots of ice.  And it's real tea, not a powder.  It smells so good I almost want to wear it! Can you tell?  I LOVE this tea!"
1,"I had blackberry jasmine iced tea in a restaurant recently, and loved it.  I searched for it online and found it here, reasonably priced, promptly delivered, and just as delicious as I tasted in the restaurant.  So glad I found a place to buy it so I can enjoy it anytime.  Best iced tea ever!"
1,"We eat at PF Changs fairly often and love the jasmine blackberry tea they serve. Looked all over for something like it, found China Mist and are delighted that it is the exact, same tea!"
1,"We drink a lot of tea in our house.  It is the drink of choice for lunch and dinner with both myself and my husband and our oldest son.  This blackberry jasmine tea is wonderful.  It tastes very much like the Jasmine blackberry tea we get at PF Chang's restaurant.  I don't know if it is the same but it tastes very simliar.  I add just a touch of sugar which seems to bring out the flavors so much.  If you are a tea drinker who appreciates flavors other than the typical, this is a wonderful product.  Also, the service was fast and accurate.  We will definitely be purchasing this again when we run out."
1,"China Mist just makes REALLY good teas anyways, my first introduction to the brand was the Passion Fruit flavor, which is to die for, but this Blackberry Jasmine is really awesome too! Sooo refreshing even from the fridge a couple days later. The blackberry flavor and smell is amazing but not overpowering the green tea. Only wish the Jasmine flavor would come through a little more clearly, but all in all, very well done!"
1,"I gave up diet coke last year. I drink water but it gets old after a while. I don't like sweet tea, but I do like to have a little flavor. This is has such a wonderful, light flavor. Even my kids like this tea! I've been stocking up so that I have plenty at all times!"
1,"A friend of mine got me started drinking unsweetened green tea at Starbucks, and I fell in love with it.  It was delicious.  Because I enjoyed it so much, I ordered green tea when some coworkers took me to lunch at Kona in Baltimore Inner Harbor.  It was SO good, it blew the Starbucks stuff out of the water.  We eat at Kona a lot, and I always drink so much of the tea that I feel like I'm sloshing when I leave.  It's so rare that I find a drink that I enjoy sipping ... not just guzzling it down because I'm thirsty.<br /><br />Today, I finally asked the server which brand they serve, though I didn't have hopes of finding it in consumer size containers (I assumed they'd be buying from direct-to-restaurant suppliers).  I am SO thrilled to find that it's accessible.  And cheaply at that!  I'm about to order several of these to keep myself pleasantly stocked in the house.  this stuff is delightful."
1,this was actually pretty good!!! after working out i get very hungry.. I didn't want to eat late so i started taking these and it helped quench the hunger and feed the muscle at the same time
1,I have only tried the Strawberry and it was suprisingly good. Some after-taste as would be expected but really good otherwise. I use this to supplement my workouts.
1,"I love the Cocoa ones, but I like these a little better.  And there isn't any sugar, just Sucralose (splenda), which makes it that much better.  One of the best sweet things to eat when watching carb intake."
1,"After being on a low-carb diet for the past few months, I was desperate for something sweet.  These almonds were like HEAVEN!  They were just what the doctor ordered and just a handful satisfied my craving for sweets.  I now eat a few after dinner every night and don't feel like I'm missing anything.  They are sweetened with Sucralose so they fit into the low-carb diet.  I liked them so well that I'm going to try the chocolate ones.  I'm also going to crush some up and put it in my ""lite"" vanilla yogurt for a granola like breakfast.  I highly recommend them!"
1,"Almost all low carb breads I've eaten taste like cardboard. Not this one! It has a coarse, nutty texture that is great. It soaks up egg for a great french toast and just toasted, it comes out crispy on the outside and still soft on the inside. The other breads from Health Express that I've bought were the Flax-yummy! And the sesame seed and the oat of which makes the best grilled cheese sandwich I've ever had!!"
1,"For those following a low carb diet, this bread is a godsend.  It is real bread that tastes homemade!  When you are tired of protein and berries this bread offers a real taste of bread.  It had no effect on my blood sugar, so I know the labeling is true."
0,26 dollars to ship 2 loaves of bread?  I can go to the grocery store and get like 12 loaves for this price.
1,"This is delicious! If you cook the sauce down for about 6 minutes with the pasta (I use penne normally) and add some shredded cheese on top (I like mozzarella more than parmesan for this dish) you have a real treat. I used to add robust to it by browning a half pound of ground beef and making a meat sauce but I have found that sometimes it's nice to let a flavor sit on its own and not add much. With a dash of olive oil, a pinch of extra oregano and pop it in the oven for about 10 minutes you have a meal that rivals some restaurants in my area.<br /><br />I am not sure about the price here on amazon. When I go to Walmart I can score a jar of this for $1.68. So 12 jars would be $20.68. For this reason I recommend you hit up your local Walmart. It may be higher if you go to other grocery stores but Walmart is cheap. Other than the price I totally recommend!"
0,I purchased this sauce at a local grocery store this afternoon. I opened it and gave it a quick taste. Absolutely no flavor to be realized . I don't know why a company would put out such a bland product when spices to repair the taste are readily available. This is a bad product. Buy something else.
0,"I'd label this as flavored water, but bottled water has more flavor. I noticed when I poured it into a sauce pan for heating it up, almost half, maybe more, was just water. Upon actually eating it, I couldn't help but notice what little bit of flavor there was tasted like regular olive oil (as opposed to the ""Extra Virgin olive oil listed in the ingredients). I'd like to think it was a bad batch, but even then you'd think quality control was better than that. Either way, I'd recommend buying a single container locally and trying that before buying a bulk quantity."
1,"I wasn't sure how many nuts were going to be in this package. I just wanted a few, but there are over a dozen nuts in this package. I have given many away to friends and family. There is a brief description about the use of the outer layer for mace and the inner kernel for the nutmeg. If you don't have a need for so much nutmeg, it makes a great gift for the other cooks in your cirle of friends."
1,"There's really not a ton to say; they're whole nutmeg nuts.  But they're at a darn good price, and Barry Farm has always shipped promptly and without any issue.  What more can you ask for, really?"
1,"A really decent, fresh product at a very good price. This defines ""value"" and it certainly applies here. Highly recommended."
1,I was very pleased with the quality of this this product plus the cost. I could not have done so well in the super markets.<br />Thank you Amazon.
0,SERIOUSLY PEOPLE ???<br /><br />$7.00 S&H on a $3.00 product ?????<br /><br />250% of the product price for SHIPPING ????<br /><br />I have had heavy text books delivered for WAY less
1,"The Capri Sun Lemonade drink puches are very handy and good tasting. My kids really like the flavor and we like that it is controlled amount of drink.<br /><br />The pouch comes with a straw that has a pointy end to puncture the pouch. It is easy to make it ""spout"" if you squeeze the pouch, so little kids might need adult help.<br /><br />Very convenient and highly recommended!"
1,"Brain Wash (as well as all the other Skeleteen drinks) are mind-bogglingly nostalgic from the first sip! From what I can tell, this company is no longer in production. I highly recommend trying this amazing soda before it's too late!"
1,"I received the blue, not the pictured red.  Also, the caps are red and white labeled ""Real Soda"", not the original black ones from the 90's that are pictured.<br /><br />Otherwise, yeah. Seems like the same stuff. Formula 8, no ephedrine (originally they had a bit more ""kick"").  The blue dye is quite potent as another reviewer mentions.<br /><br />Bottles arrived quickly and unbroken, if a tad warm to drink pleasantly."
0,"sounded interesting with some okay ingredients,but... package arrived with four out of twelve bottles broken...also, the taste is just a little too unique. I still have bottles left and I can't even give them away. And the blue color is so intense your tongue will stay blue for days.(and so will your BM's)"
0,"I can not find these Cella Milk Chocolate Covered Cherries in local retail stores.  So I ordered these online.  I was surprised to receive them so quickly.  I had them 2 days after I ordered and I ordered on a Sunday.  However, once I opened them and ate a few I am disappointed.  The liquid center in these candies is gone and the cherries inside are all dried up.  Somehow the liquid filling either evaporated are just dried up as there is no sticky evidence of leaking in the box.  Also, the milk chocolate has a chalky look as if it has oxidized.  We can still eat them as they are okay, but they are not as advertized on the outside of the box as containing a clear liquid center.  I think it's obvious that these Chocolates are just very old and probably have exceeded their optimum shelf life.  I will not order from this reseller again."
1,they had slightly melted but were still reasonably ok to eat.  It's best to buy these any season except the summer months.  Not the sellers fault if it's hot weather while in transit.
0,The first thing I noticed was an odd smell. That dissipated after a half hour or so. Off to a bad start. But I was willing to try one. It was sticky. The wrappers clearly had a layer of the cream filling all over the outsides.<br />In fact half of them were sticky. There was the source of the smell. There is no indication any of them were damaged and leaked that might have caused the stickiness. There are three levels separated by a sheet of cardboard but no stickiness on the cardboard. Because of all that they were sticky before they were put into the box.<br />Never again.
1,Especially now that they included the warning about pits on the box. A. You know they are using real cherries and B. You could bite into a pit so chew carefully.
1,"I ordered these on Dec.17,and I was hoping it would get to where it had to go by Christmas,it made it by noon on the 20th.Great service."
1,"These cordials are in my humble opinion 1st class.  I try and order at least a case them every year and share with my best friends.<br /><br />In years past they have arrived with several smashed and leaking, this seller got them here quickly and intact.<br /><br />Thank you, God bless, and Merry Christmas"
1,"Suffice it to say that no other chocolate covered cherries are as good as Cella's.  These have been my favorite for many, many years."
1,The sugar free huckleberry jam was wonderful. It tasted just like huckleberries. I have really enjoyed it. I will definitely purchase it again.
1,"If you like Huckleberries, this one is for you, just grab a spoon (like we did) and skip the toast.  Our only complaint, not enough . . . we placed another order 2 days later."
1,I got this for my diabetic father in law.  When I tasted it I wished I had gotten myself a jar or two.  It's tart but I don't like sickenly sweet jams.  It has a wonderful taste.
1,The quality of this tea is 5 star-it is in sealed bags. We're trying it out to see if helps our nails & skin.
1,"I tried this around Christmas time. It is so good,I find myself smacking my lips to get the last of the taste off. This six pack price is much cheaper than buying 6 individual bottles in my local supermarket. TIP: Sprinkle chicken or pork with J&D'S Bacon Salt, before putting in the oven. When it's time for the sauce, add generously. The combination is wild!"
1,"I've been backyard sugarin for several years and this filter clears the syrup like nothing else and is reusable.  It is large and you do need to figure out a home set up, it's easy enough to use and washable/reusable.  Our syrup was the best it's ever been this year!  Filtering throughout the process is key and for $14, it's well worth the investment.  We set it over a coffee pot with spout, work in small batches so the syrup doesn't cool and you have a spout to fill jars.  You could use a cone colander/sieve/strainer as well, probably could pick up in an antique store cheap."
1,"If you are a backyard sugarer, you should definitely consider getting a maple syrup filter.  Just understand how large this filter is and make sure you are prepared to use it.  The 8-quart filter is 19"" tall, which may be larger than what many backyarders will need."
1,I wanted to make sure my maple syrup was clear for long term storage and for that gorgeous warm clear colour. I needed something that could do the job while i wasn't there and just slowly filter the product to be canned. This is perfect. I just throw it in the washing machine when finished and pack it up again for use next year. It just works. Strong and practical and easy to use.
1,"This past season was my first sugaring experience.  I was happy with this filter, it took out a lot of sediment and crystals for a pretty nice syrup. I would wet the filter with warm water before running the warm syrup through it and it worked effectively. This is tall and skinny and I didn't have anything to really hold it up, so actually filtering took a bit of coordination.  I somewhat wish I had a shorter fatter filter, but haven't seen any out there. I cleaned it quickly each time I used it, but by the end of the season with the darker syrup it did get some staining. I will consider getting the filter liners for next season and maybe something that will hold it in place for me (if that exists)."
1,This filter did a great job on my small backyard operation.  After running my syrup through it I didn't have any sentimentation.
1,"I ordered this filter after using cheese cloth and other methods of making my syrup clear and free of debris. I didn't want to spend any money on a product that won't help me be self sufficient. So I bought it, and I was amazed by it with my first small 2 quart batch. So I washed it in the washer, bad idea, it held onto some soap and my next batch tasted soapy. So I suggest always wash this by hand, and don't use soap every time. Be sure to clean it out very good as it will hold old debris if not cleaned well. It does hold onto a cup or more of syrup, I dip it back into the next batch of syrup gently to transfer some of the old syrup sugar back into the new batch. DO NOT REVERSE it or turn it inside out to do this. Gently dip it in... Glad I made this purchase, it has helped me make a great end product. Modern Pioneer"
1,"I bought these in bulk hoping to be able to enjoy for a while. However, they are so good I went right through the box. Laffy Taffy is always hard to pass up on when I see in the store (espically Banana being my favorite flavor). Again being prime shipping, makes this an easy buy."
1,These were purchased for my brother who is in a nursing home.<br />He just loves these. Especially the banana ones.<br />They smell really good.
1,I LOVE BANANA TAFFY! and it's hard to find. I recieved my taffy petty fast and it did my craving! No I'm not pregnant. Just LOVE!!! I would work with this buyer again! Excellent to do business with!
1,The product was exactly as advertised and arrived very quickly.  I have nothing to say but good things about the seller.

1,"I first became exposed to these when my husband's aunt sent some to the family from England.  His parents had grown up on them, but we don't get these in the U.S. even though Nestle now owns the brand.  If you like toffee candies, you have to get this!!  I am seriously addicted to half of the candies in this assortment and ordered one tub for his family for Christmas and other for just the two of us!"
1,Quality Street chocolates are a Xmas tradition in many families. I must have them during the holidays or it is not the same. They have become very difficult to find in the US over the last few years but thank god for Amazon!<br />Try a bottle and get your favorites. My friends are addicted!
1,So glad to fine my favorite candy here in the USA. Price was well below others on the site. Service was fantastic.  Shipped the same day.  Will reorder from then again.....
1,Pretty much the title says it. Might try Celebrations or Roses next year - we did all those when we lived there.... I believe this was the most economical when I looked this year.
1,These chocolates are the best but unfortunately they are not easy to find in the US as they are European. The product was very fresh and tasted amazing!
1,"thank you for your fast service ,i havernt had these chocolates in a long time ,happy new year,i will be ordering more english food from you later in the year .thanks"
1,Thank you sooooo much for carrying this product.  My wife and I recently spent a year in the United Kingdom and we both developed quite a sweet tooth for a number of products while there.<br />Her one main gift request for Christmas was a container of quality street.  Thank you for helping to make her Christmas come true.<br />I would definitely recommend this seller.<br />Item arrived in great time even with massive snow delays before it even left the UK.<br />Thank you again.!!
1,5MM Pink Edible Pearls are a wonderful addition to cakes & cookies!  They can instantly add sophistication to any piece!
1,"I am a Diabetic and also, at this time, cannot drive.  So, I am so glad that I can purchase many of my favorite grocery items on Amazon.  This Diet Cranberry Juice is wonderful and good for you. I also purchase Macro Greens Nutrient-Rich Super Food Supplement (wonderful for you) here on Amazon which I put in about a glass of cranberry juice.  It is great together.  That's the first thing I have in the morning.  Check that out also!"
1,The cherries arrived on time and sealed in a bag. I opened them and start enjoying right away. Chopped em in salads and mostly just ate five or six by hand every day.I would order them again fer sure.
1,"These are my favorite snack right now. Crunchy, tangy, a tiny bit hot... Altogether delicious. These are even better paired with a bag of pretzels!"
1,"I have tried several of Frontera's sauces. I've liked them all and that may be because they each have overlapping flavor profiles. This particular sauce has similar essences to the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IFVCM"">Frontera Pouch, Enchilada Skillet Red Chile, 8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>.  Even the green sauces have similar profiles.  The <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IH9M2"">Frontera Pouch, Taco Garlic Steak Skillet, 8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> overlaps a little with this. While the product's packaging makes suggestions for use for a particular protein, I feel that many of the manufacturer's other sauces could be used in a pinch. They seem to favor chipotle pepper and garlic. This sauce doesn't have much heat and it isn't too heavy on the chipotle.  It is good sauteed with vegetables for fajitas.  I liked to pair the marinated, cooked vegetables with avocado slices. Again, this is a fine sauce, but once you have tried some of the other Frontera sauces, the flavor profile becomes familiar.  This particular sauce didn't have much honey flavoring at all.<br /><br />Ingredients: Tomato puree (water, tomato paste), chipotle pepper, tomato, honey, distilled white vinegar, canola and vegetable oil, salt, roasted garlic, xanthan gum, paprika, spices.<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 Tbsp<br />Servings Per Container: 11<br />Calories Total 15<br />Total Fat  1 g<br />Sodium  290 mg<br />Total Carbohydrates 2 g<br />Dietary fiber  &lt;1 g<br />Sugars  2 g<br />Protein 0 g"
1,"I am not old enough to remember the original fizzies, I bought a package of green apple fizzies as a stocking stuffer for my diabetic son 2 years ago.<br />He loved them, and I have been buying them ever since. I love that they are fun and different but sugar free - it can be hard to be a kid and can't have all the fun candy like your friends. My other (not diabetic) son loves them as well - I don't buy soda, so they are like a special treat.<br />Make sure you use the 6 oz. water as directed, the first time we made a drink we were so disappointed with how watered down it was - ooops! we used about 3x the amount of water."
1,"I love Fizzies, and find them best, when broken into three or four pieces, then I put one piece in a glass of regular soda pop. which makes it fizzier! It's all about the fizz!"
1,"I drank Bailey's Irish Creme for years and thoroughly enjoyed it. I saw this brand at my local liquor store and asked another person picking up a bottle of this brand what they thought of the two in comparison. They liked Carolans better. I bought a bottle to try and I find it smoother and cheaper than Bailey's. It has the same rich flavor. I have tried competitive brands of other liquors before and been disappointed that they tasted ""watered down"" or were harsh and went back to the standard. I won't on this one."
0,"A diluted hot sauce derived from the jalape&ntilde;o pepper. A 5 oz bottle is far too small given its diluted nature. You might use close to a bottle for a single family sized meal.<br /><br />Ingredients (as listed, in this order, from the product label): Water, acetic acid, jalape&ntilde;o peppers, carrots, sugar, ...etc<br /><br />Tasting notes - diluted heat along with a heavy vinegar taste and, at best, a vague jalape&ntilde;o flavor.  The vinegar flavor dominates (acetic acid is a component of vinegar).<br /><br />As noted in the title of my review - a below average hot sauce. I'd pass on this one. The vinegar taste is over powering. Note that the second ingredient (after water) is acetic acid (a chemical component of vinegar)!<br /><br />I'd recommend the El Yucateco Hot Jalape&ntilde;o Hot sauce which uses the same Jalape&ntilde;o pepper but it has a much purer and fresher taste. I love the Jalape&ntilde;o pepper but this sauce does not feature its fine qualities very well.<br /><br />PS - As should be evident -- I enjoy taste testing hot sauces and writing up my results. I've tried about 50 different ones to date. I try very hard to describe flavor notes and list the actual ingredients."
1,This is my favorite hot sauce.  My favorite way to use it is in macaroni & cheese.  It adds the perfect amount of heat & smoke to anything that needs spicing up.  I used to be able to buy it at my local grocery store but now it's impossible to find.  Hate spending this much to buy online but I love it that much.  Bufalo makes many different flavors but the Jalapeno is my favorite.
1,"I saw a bottle of this at my local grocer. I love jalapenos and seeing a red jalapeno sauce made it a must buy.<br /><br />The sauce was not what I expected, I was expecting a thin vinegary kind of Mexican hot sauce. This sauce is much thicker than that, but not as thick as ketchup. It is a bit tangy with a balance of sweet and heat. The label says ""Very Hot"", but it will only seem this way to those who are more sensitive to heat than the average spicy food fan.<br /><br />After my first taste the first thing that came to mind was hot wings. They have the perfect tangy/sweet/hot sort of flavor profile, along with a consistency that lends itself very well to sticking to wings (both cooked and raw). It is also thick enough to be brushed on wings while they are being cooked on a grill. I began to wonder if the brand name was called ""Bufalo"" because it was intended to be used for wings, but after some research I found out that the company name precedes Buffalo Wings by quite a long time, the name is pure coincidence.<br /><br />As a wing sauce this stuff is a welcome addition. It is a very slight change from your standard hot wing flavor, being made with Jalapenos, while still very true to the flavor you expect from hot wings. As a hot sauce on its own it is good but each time I try it on something else I keep coming back to how much this tastes like a wing sauce.<br /><br />I recommend giving this stuff a try to see what you think. Definitely try it on your next set of wings. My next bottle will be the larger sized bottle because I plan to make some more wings with this stuff."
1,"If you are looking for a strong and robust cup of coffee, look no further.<br />Every time I brew a cup I get a reaction from people near by.<br />You can even run the same bag twice into one cup to get a slightly weaker cup of coffee....it's still eye opening however!<br />Brew On"
1,"This stuff is never cheap, but this is less expensive than the Flavia website and I really like this coffee.  When the Flavia machine breaks down I will not be ordering another as there are more varieties with a Keureg and the coffee can be found everywhere"
1,"This was my first time to work with fondant. I tryed this one and I it realy works, you just need to follow the instructions very carefuly."
1,"I have been a diabetic for more than 17 years now. Most folks with diabetes know that the majority of the low-carb foods are pretty bad tasting. I read the other review for this product and chose to ignore their negative review because I have never found a sugar-free product that tastes exactly like the product it is to replace. The Honeytree Honey has the consistency of honey, the sweetness of honey, and a very plesent taste. No, it doesn't taste exactly like honey, but it is a very acceptable alternative. Thanks Honeytree, I am about to place my second order for this product."
1,"I have used this product for years. It has lots of flavor and resembles and feels like real honey. The down-side of this product is the gas ""problem"" when you eat excess (???) amounts of it. I use it in place of Karo syrup to make almond-crusted pecan pies. It produces an ""okay"" pie. However, I eat large slices of this pecan pie and that causes the gas ""problem"". I bought bottles of Nature's Hollow and Natrazyle Kosher substitutes for side-by-side comparison with Honey Tree. Although neither caused a gas ""problem"", I believe both are lacking in flavor and the Natrazyle appeared to have a slimy ""mouth-feel"". I will try each of these in a pecan pie and if I believe either of the pies is better than the Honey Tree pie, I will report back."
1,the product was worth the price and because there is a health concern with use we can not have suger .for what we use it for it does well
0,"Having been diagnosed diabetic I really miss all the heavy duty sweets to which I was accustomed.  My father and my husband were both beekeepers so I know what real honey should taste like.  This product definitely does not live up to anything resembling that taste.  True, it is sweet, and I must admit serves a purpose of sorts, but as for tasting anything like honey - no, it definitely does NOT.  I once made a 9x12 pan of baklava and ate all of it (except one small piece eaten by my husband) in 3-4 days - so, I know whereof I speak."
1,"This fruit BBQ sauce is unique.  It's amazing and refreshing. Used it to top off a ham loaf and got rave reviews from everyone who tasted it. Plan on using it next on chicken, egg rolls and pork roast.  I've looked for other fruity BBQ sauces but can't find any out there - so this is really unique - a surprise for everyone who tries it. I will continue to order this often and keep a supply on hand to perk up our dinners."
1,"This is a good matcha for the price. The best matcha can be much more expensive but well worth it, espcially if you happen to study the Japanese tea ceremony or you are a tea connoseur. If you do get this type of tea, it is wise to buy a proper bamboo wisk and sift it first, otherwise it can get lumpy. Making matcha the traditional way is well worth the effort and there is a LOT to learn about it. Some say to master the tea ceremony can take years.<br /><br />As far as the health benefits go, there is a lot of talk about green tea being good for you and I must say, I feel really good now that I am drinking it 1-3 days per week and I have even lost a few pounds. Matcha does have caffine and if I have more than two or three bowls I will definately feel it. It's probably a wise idea to not drink too much matcha before bed! Green and black tea both have caffine for the most part. Different teas have different amounts of caffine. It's a good idea to read labels carefully and do your research if you are sensitive to caffine or must avoid it. The type of caffine in a beverage also has a lot to do with how people respond to it. Caffine also has a different effect on everyone depending on your body. Some people get jittery, others don't and the more caffine you consume the less you will tend to feel the effects of it. I tend to feel jittery with coffee or soda but not with tea.<br /><br />Matcha is also great for smoothies, baking, ice cream and much, much more. Another note; Fresh matcha is a very bright green color, old matcha gets a darker pine-gray color to it and can taste bitter or ashy with a clumpy consistancy. Always note the date on the can. To avoid stale green tea, I reccommend storing it in an airtight bag and keeping it in the fridge. Stale tea isn't noticable when you put it in a smoothie or cake but if you make a hot beverage you will notice a big difference in the quality.<br /><br />Matcha is generally served with sweets and is good paired with fruity or vanilla desserts but it tends to clash with chocolate. Of course mochi (sweet rice cakes) go very well with matcha and are the traditional choice but unless you live near an Asian market, or you're a good cook, they can be hard to come by and have a short shelf life. The frozen Mochi ice cream nuggets are a good option too and sold in a lot of grocery stores.<br /><br />I reccommend this tea if you are new to drinking matcha. If you love it, it's the tastiest matcha in it's price range and if you hate it, at least you didn't waste too much cash. If you are taking tea lessons it's a good 'practice' tea and won't break your pocketbook, especially when you find out the price of tea bowls, fukusa, natsume, furo and the other utensils used in a tea ceremony!<br /><br />Regardless if you study Chado or if you are a casual tea drinker, I encourage all tea lovers to try matcha. The methods of making and preparing matcha are over 800 years old and when you taste it, you certainly understand why it's never gone out of style!"
1,"Two other reviewers have already spoken. The most recent one attempting to undermine what the first reviewer had said. Actually, the first reviewer DOES know what he is talking about. Green tea DOES contain caffeine. This from an expert source:<br /><br />Caffeine<br /><br />Although black tea is thought to have the highest caffeine content of all tea, this is actually untrue. Green tea has more caffeine. However it must be understood that because of other compounds, the caffeine in green tea functions in a special and balancing way. The caffeine in green tea is surrounding by tannic acid compounds, which inhibit it from surging all at once into our bloodstream. In a sense, the caffeine in green tea is time-released into our bloodstream. This time-release effect makes the stimulation gentle and quite pleasant. It also allows us to feel the effects of green tea for an extended period of time, and outlasts the effects experienced by our friends, who are drinking coffee or cola. The effect of green tea makes us free of agitation and nervousness, and its blissful stimulation feels good to the senses.<br /><br />Enough said.........enjoy your tea............."
1,"I noticed a difference between the quality of this matcha and a much more expensive variety.  I am currently a matcha neophyte but I noticed that the expensive matcha tasted significantly better, seemed more fresh, and had a better brighter color.  I use one heaping teaspoon per pint of hot water, and unfortunately with the more expensive variety it costs over five dollars per pint of matcha tea when you use this much.  Even so, if you can afford it, seek out the finer grades of matcha straight from Uji Japan.  The Uji region is famous for their fine Gyokuro tea and superior grades of matcha.  If you don't have that kind of money, this matcha could suffice, but try to get the Uji-based premium matchas, especially for special occasions.  This matcha is listed as being from Uji, but it isn't as good as the more expensive varieties from the same area."
1,"I love this product.<br />I had a chance to drink green tea latte at Starbucks.<br />But, Starbucks green tea latte is very expensive.<br />So, I try to make green tea latte myself and I find out they use Matcha.<br />Everyday I made my own green tea latte for me and my wife.<br />She really likes it.<br />Fortunately, I found same product at local store with price $5.99."
0,"Ujinotsuyu Matcha Hagoromo is not nearly as good as some of the other brands of matcha I tried. Instead of being a pure green, it had a faint yellow-brownish tinge. It was also quite harsh and bitter-flavored. If you're willing to spend more money but don't want expensive tea ceremony grade matcha, try Do Matcha 2nd Harvest (the red label variety). It has a much lighter and fresher flavor. My local store also carries Maeda-en, which is better than Ujinotsuyu but not as good as Do Matcha."
1,"This tea is premium.  Don't accept green tea in bags; it is less tasty and probably less healthy.<br /><br />Here are just a few medical conditions in which drinking green tea is reputed to be helpful:<br /><br />* cancer<br />* rheumatoid arthritis<br />* high cholesterol levels<br />* cariovascular disease<br />* infection<br />* impaired immune function<br /> * acne, omg.<br /><br />And drink four cups a day for the ultimate tea benefits!"
1,When I first got this container of Matcha I thought it was a lot to pay for such a small container. Let me tell you..a little bit goes a long way! Matcha green tea is also much more flavourful than brewing tea from a teabag.  I have also found many recipes that call for green tea powder and this has worked out well. I would say the price I paid is well worth the wonderful matcha that I purchased.
1,"I like using this matcha for latte smoothies and so far it has been yummy.  Saves me $$$ at the coffee shop, because now I make my own."
0,"I found the matcha to be very bitter and grainy. I had few bowls but it ended up being used to cookies which were very tasty. Also made some smoothies with honey added and they were a hit.<br />I didnt buy from amazon. I got mine from a tea shop in chinatown for $5/can. I wanted to see if you really get what you pay for.<br />I have been buying my matcha directly from japan(yuuki-cha, ippodo,o-cha) and i dont think its fair to compare since they cost $20-30/can.<br />if you are looking for a serious drinking tasteful matcha stay away from this one. But as culinary grade matcha its certainly a good value."
0,"When I received it and soon after opened it, the matcha appears a pale green, as if it has been sitting in storage too long before they sent it. DoMatcha, on the other hand, when I first bought it was bright green and fresher.<br /><br />Not into this brand --  I prefer DoMatcha. . ."
1,I don't know why we can't get excellent quality green tea powder in this country without having to pay a fortune for it.
0,"Being new to matcha, I bought two types to sample, this and the ingredient grade matcha from MatchaSource. I opened the MatchaSource one first and found it delicious, bright green, lovely flavour, dissolves well if you follow the instructions and dissolve in a little hot water before adding the milk. Then I tried this one, and was quite disappointed, the powder is sage green in colour, produces a grey-brown tea with very little flavour and the powder never quite dissolves.  Not at all what I was expecting given my experience with the MatchaSource tea. Between the two, this will not be the one that I buy again. Nice tin, though."
0,"I made a cup of my usual..using preheated steamed frothed milk, this ""maccha"" green tea powder  and sometimes a little Stevia. YUCK.<br /><br />I paid $14.99 at an Asian store for this. The Eden $36 a can was much much much better...you can get that $27 or $29 a can in bulk.  I've ordered some stuff from Japan..Ryu-Mei. I'll let you know how this works out when it arrives.<br /><br />I guess if you just want to add powder to regular tea to make yourself feel better about the added health benefits this would be ok. If you hate the green twiggy matcha taste, this is ok.<br /><br />This is probably ok as ingredient grade. Or if you like iced tea...<br /><br />This is a sage green powder color ground very fine.<br />Tastes like ground BROWN tea. YUCK.<br />Nothing like the ""Green"" in Eden's Spring matcha.<br /><br />The tin comes with a bag inside and a preservative (oxygen destroyer pack). You open the bag when you are ready to serve. Then dump the contents in the tin.<br /><br />To each his own, this is not for me."
1,I received my package of Green Tea with three days and it was exactly as decribed in the ad.
1,"Drink tea. You'll like the tea. Especially the tea in the big tin. And if you drink enough of this tea, you'll be very healthy - or very awake and jittery. ONe of the two. Either way you can throw the tin at your neighbors when they are having another loud party outside. And that can't be bad."
1,"but the previous reviewer doesn't know that with his ""jittery"" comments.  He loves looking at what he writes on products he knows nothing about and doesn't even try.  Never helpful but allways full of himself, and all that for your pleasure!  All for the price of nothing.... and thats what its worth."
1,"So, I've been a fan of licorice for decades, and tried too many brands.  This one is a standout! Rich licorice flavor, chewy but neither rock hard or too soft.  Hard to find - I've literally gone to Cost Plus MANY times, seen full racks of other brands, and this specific formulation always sells out - and is hard to find. Now I get it on the 'Net.  Other formulations by Katjes are not as good, in my view."
1,Great product and price! I use it to make graham crackers for our children and will never go back to the store-bought kind.
1,All the stores say use whole wheat instead of graham flour it is the same no it is not. I used to get five pound bags but now it comes in this' size or fifty pound bag from a local CO-OP  so I guess it works and the price is not too bad.
1,This coffee is fantastic and at a reasonable price.  Everything about the purchase went smoothly just as advertised.  I highly recommend Emeril's jazzed up decaf'
1,"I bought this tea especially for my husband.  I've not been a big fan of Green Tea, but this product was great.  It wasn't bitter like some green tea is.  It had a smooth flavorful taste.  I will be buying it again."
1,i love this green tea-it is the only one i will order and drink.most green teas have a bitter after taste-not this one-it is delicious.i am sure if you are agreen tea lover you will truly enjoy this product.it is a very relaxing drink-especially when you are reading your kindle!!!
1,"This was my first tea purchase for our Keurig machine, and I am very pleased. The flavor was smooth - no bitterness at all. Drank it hot, and over ice - both were fantastic. I will be buying this again."
1,"We love this tea, especially when it's made into ice tea.  We just brew it over ice and presto!  You can add sweetener - or not.  It's a great summer drink."
1,"I loved this green tea! I say where did it go, because it didn't take me long to drink all the cups! I guess I will have to order more, so good!"
1,"I am not a HUGE tea fan, I'm a coffee drinker. But I do like green tea, and this is a nice and easy way to get green tea!"
0,"I purchased this tea along with several other kcup varieties for a coffee maker that gets occasional use.  Unfortunatley, the expiration date on the Celestial Green Decaf Tea purchased here on Amazon is within one month.  I know I will be throwing away most of this tea because it will expire before it is used.  All the other kcups purchased have at least one year before they expire.<br /><br />The shipping to return the tea would have cost half the price of the tea.  I don't think I will purchase any more food items on Amazon."
1,I'm on the 17 Day diet and drink this tea at least 3 times a day. I love it. Perfect for the large cup size on th K. It's also one of the few decaf teas offered that doesn't have a funky taste. it's a staple for me. I highly recommend it.
1,"I love these single serve cups, no steeping, so easy to use, would recommend to everyone. Very affordable, great tasting."
1,"It is difficult to find some products in Decaf for our Keurig brewer, and I have been pleased with the Celestial Seasonings green tea.  It makes a great cup of hot tea or glass of iced tea, and I keep it on hand all the time for my green tea cravings.  The convenience of availability through Amazon has been a real plus."
1,"Celestial Seasonings has long been one of my favorite brands, and the caffeine-free green tea has a good, strong flavor.  I like it with a dab of honey. With the Keurig cups, it couldn't be easier to have a hot cup of tea in the afternoon.  Keurig isn't the least expensive way to go, for sure.  Much higher than tea bags.  But it makes a flavorful cup of whatever you brew - tea, coffee, mochas, cider. It's all good."
1,Service was super and the product is yummy  I have to write more words so I'll say the product is yummy again.
1,"I wanted a tea I could have any time of day and not have caffeine bother me. I really like this tea!  It has a little of the white tea in it too (which is my favorite type), and I like it both hot and made into iced tea. Very mild smooth taste. Glad to have found this item!"
1,While I do love to shop on Amazon and do ( I love it too much ). The Kcups are less expensive on the Keurig web site. One of the very few things that cost less elsewhere.
1,"I bought this for my dad as a gift, he loved it, and my parents said it was very pretty also. I like to give them gifts that they can nibble on, as they have about everything else one could imagine. Gifts like this one can at least be consumed. Good gift and glad to have this kind of option."
1,"I have a GSD/lab mix with a bazillion allergies. I've cut out just about every allergen (most of which was not for dogs anyway) in her diet. I feel fully comfortable giving her these treats, and she LOVES them.<br /><br />For those people with severe allergy dogs, I want you to know that her itching has not stopped, just by using these treats. It is believed that she has environmental allergies too. However, the food allergy part (that was giving her massive ear infections) has, knock on wood, not returned. I also switched her food to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004RO7AVM"">Natural Choice Grain Free Venison and Potato</a>, so I think that these treats, combined with her food, has been a success, even if she still itches.<br /><br />Her itching is puzzling though because I did note a serious coat change when she started using these. It adds a teensy bit of an oily gloss and makes it look very healthy. Her ""dandruff"" has also disappeared, so it makes for a good moisturizer for dry skin, which is what I thought was causing the itching. Evidently not.<br /><br />These are small treats, about 1""x0.5"". Though they are small, these are not good trainer treats due to the Omegas in them. These are just good old fashioned healthy snacks, like a human's raw vegetable snack.<br /><br />Okay, so all that said, check your prices. I have a 14-oz bag that I got at Petsmart on sale for about $8. That is significantly cheaper than here. Even if not on sale, I will buy them for all the reasons I've listed above.<br /><br />I read a review on these that said there is no odor. Maybe I'm overly sensitive, but there is a definite odor and it is not a pleasant one. It's not a powerful scent, but it is definitely there. Keep in mind that stinky dog treats are treats your dog will likely prefer over those that don't stink. After all they're dogs. They like stinky stuff. lol!<br /><br />I wanted to also mention that I see at their website (which is actually cardinalpet) that they do NOT use any Diamond facilities, in case any were wondering. I cannot vouch for that, but is just another FYI. Also, and this is fair warning, it says that they are a 'Product of China'.<br /><br />I noticed that Amazon does not give you very much information on the treats here, so let me give you what you're probably wanting to know, since I just happen to have a pack sitting right here.<br /><br />I think Amazon should require food sellers to provide nutritional data for humans and pet food. Don't you? It's too bad we have to do that for them. :(<br /><br />== Per their package (none of these are my comments) ==<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />Salmon, sweet potato, cod, cane sugar, glycerin, salt, potassium sorbate and mixed tocopherals (vitamin E).<br /><br />These dog treats are designed and formulated using 100% food grade ingredients and produced in facilities that only make food quality products.<br /><br />Cane sugar and salt are part of a natural preservative system.<br /><br />DOES NOT CONTAIN<br />wheat, soybean, lechithin, BHA, BHT, ethoxyquin, artificial flavor, gluten or grains.<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br />Crude protein 10.0% (min)<br />crude fat 3.0% (min)<br />crude fiber 1.0%<br />moisture 16.0%<br />omega 3* 0.15%<br />omega 6* 0.40%<br />* Nutrient is not recognized as essential by the AAFCO Dog Food Nutrient Profiles.<br /><br />CALORIE CONTENT<br />8.6 Kcal per treat/ 2400 Kcal/kg<br /><br />== end package ==<br /><br />I do highly recommend these treats and give it the full 5-stars that it deserves."
1,These are the best treats for my Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier. She just loves them.  She will do whatever I ask if these treats are her reward.  I love the fact that they are healthy for her as she has allergies!
1,"I love sweet potatoes and it's hard to find sweet-potato cake mix, so I was excited to make this. I grated half a raw sweet potato into the mix and let the batter sit a while as the box suggested (optional) before baking.  The cake came out moist, dense, and full of sweet-potato flavor -- but way too sweet, even when on another try I added oat bran for a healthier version. Sugar content isn't numerically higher than other cake mixes (22 grams per serving) but the TASTE is way sweeter.  Maybe that's not a bad thing if it satisfies your sweet tooth with just a small sliver at a time."
1,"Best tasting black licorice in the world; second only to Pennsylvania Dutch Candies ""Coal Candy"" which they unfortunately quit making several years ago. The Seller did an outstanding job packing it, delivery was fast and communication was great. Plus, Seller had the most competitve price around. All and all a great experience; and, I can honestly say that I highly recommend this Seller."
1,"I love Pop Rocks - fun, tasty and low calorie (I think these are 26 calories per pack). Perfect for when a sweet craving hits, or when you're just kinda bored and want something to lift your mood. Some of the flavors are just too sweet for me, but I like the strawberry."
1,"POP ROCKS 36 packs Strawberry Sold by candymachines/<br />Penguinmints Thru Amazon, & Free Super Saving Shipping...<br />  They are so fresh & they Definitely pop great<br />in your mouth, & they taste great also.. YUM, YUM..<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00155UY3W"">Pop Rocks 36 Packs Strawberry</a>"
1,"I just couldn't resist! lol  Hey, I love a good sense of humor, so I hope you do too. ;)<br /><br />Okay - Now the review - Simple actually - Very clean & fresh, and makes the best tasting hummus! A staple in my home, and highly recommend!"
0,"i have put more than a few gingerbread houses together with my kids and this was buy far the worst experience i have EVER had with one. do not waste your money on this pile of garbage. they use the Barbie name to draw you in and then nothing fits together, the directions are horrible and the house itself it tiny. from now on i will stick with a no name brand gingerbread house. my wife just left to buy a REAL GB house and i have just finished throwing this piece of garbage where it belongs....in the trash.<br /><br />one good thing....the kids were are eating it, so its tasty."
1,"This is the best buy I have found and my dog just goes crazy happy when I give the treat.<br />I do hope you will get this back in stock in the future,"
0,One star is too generous. I love the tea and hate the seller. I ordered 6 packs of twining tea. The first seller I chose had a 6 pack and each pack with 20 bags. The next search was for the same deal and it even listed as a 6 pack. Now that I got the package I see it's one lousy box of 20 bags for more than $19. What an incredible rip off. Last time for Shaqdis Books and Marketplace for me.
1,"I was most distressed when I discovered my local grocery store was no longer going to carry this tea; how was I going to get through my evenings without it? Then the light bulb went on & I thought ""I'll get it from Amazon!"" Shipping was very fast & now I have a good supply in my cupboard. When I run out, I know where it order it next time."
1,"Since I am a teetotaler, I haven't tried this in the various cocktails where it is featured (just search the 'net for recipes). I love bitters in club soda. This product has a VERY intense lavender flavor, and I personally found that it was almost too floral to be drunk with soda. I did add some orange bitters and that helped. I think that these bitters will be perfect in cooking (I'm thinking lavender ice cream...) and perhaps as an herbal component, much like lavender in herbs de provence. If you love lavender you will very pleased. A little goes a long ways, so this bottle will last and last."
1,"The Red Sea Salt has a earthy flavor; it is slower to dissolve on the tongue.  It is a beautiful, unexpected hue, and surprised and delighted my dinner guests--none had ever tasted it before!  I used a light sprinkling on my endive salad (along with pepper) and it looked exotic and tasted amazing!~"
1,"This product is amazing.  Not only did I get a very good tasting product, but I also got a hand written note AND a free sample of candy made fresh by Das Foods.  I also purchased the Lava Salt with the same reaction.  I would recomend this product to anyone who is looking for one of those different seasonings for their food."
1,This product was an excellent price for a quality product. Shipping was much quicker than expected and came with a hand-written note on the envoice. The holiday shipping did not deter this company from providing first-class service. It would be a pleasure to order from them again.
1,"I just have to say that I agree with the first reviewer.  I really had a good experience with this product.  I was buying it for a friend, it came very quickly, the product is unique, and it is something that everyone can use.  The customer service was outstanding."
1,"This salt has a great flavor.  It is a little coarser than I expected and is slow to dissolve, but it give a nice salty burst of flavor with just a hint of something more.  A little goes a long way.  I think this salt is wonderful on fish and beef.  I was very pleased with my order from DAS Salt/DAS Foods - fast shipping, great product, pleasant thank you note and samples included with my order.  Although it's not inexpensive, an order of gourmet salts is well worth it from this company."
1,"I've been using this red sea salt for a few years when i work (I'm a chef). The flavor is really bright and enhances quite a few dishes, from meats to veggies and even desserts. I decided to buy some for my home recently here. I find it is better used as a finisher, i.e.  sprinkled on foods. I also use it in seafood rubs quite often. My favorite uses are sprinkled on fresh veggies such as cucumber slices and heirloom tomatoes, on chocolate/caramel dishes, and used with seafood. I have several salts, so i generally use this for those three purposes, but sometimes, I'll add it to other dishes as well. It doesnt really dissolve quickly (probably due to the red clay which gives it its color), so it is better used in dishes where that isnt an expectation. Otherwise, it is multifunctional and i think you'll like it. Enjoy!"
1,"I bought this salt and the black lava salt for my husband, who is the chef in the family. Both are delicious, with different flavors that are appropriate in different settings. He's having a great time determining all those settings, and I'm having a great time tasting his results.<br /><br />The salts came with a note from the company and a free sample of some candy; it was a very friendly and pleasant introduction to the company. They also arrived quickly, in plenty of time for the gift-giving occasion for which I needed them."
1,"It arrived when they said it would, and it's a fine salt product.  A really good finishing salt."
1,"I lived on Oahu for 5 years and I had Kalua pork often.  I decided to make my own a few weeks ago and used this salt.  It took me right back to the islands.  Easy recipe too, rub this salt and a bit of liquid smoke on the pork shoulder or butt and throw into a crockpot.  Let it cook on low for about 20 hours and turn once during that time.  Remove the pork and shred and serve.  Good stuff."
1,"I debated buying this, as it's rather expensive. I'm glad I got it. It's highly flavorful and more effective than a similar amount of table salt. And since you need so little, it'll last much longer than the small container would make you think. The flavors have more depth than some other sea salts, but they aren't as overwhelming as the truly dark salts. The red color lends beauty to your finished dish. Keep in mind that this is intended as a finishing salt---something to be sprinkled in small amounts over a finished dish---not as a substitute for salt called for in a recipe."
1,I needed red Hawaiian sea salt for a recipe.  It was very easy to order and came right away.  It was very good in the recipe.  I'm glad I was able to purchase it this way because I could not find it in a store near me at all.
1,Love the flavor of this salt. The salt changes colors on hot food and gives it a different look.
1,This product adds alot of flavor to every dish I use it on.It also adds a little color.
1,This is a good product.  Has an unique taste to it.  Great to put on pork before you grill it.
1,"I love the flavor of this beautiful, corally colored, sea salt. Another teriffic finishing salt what adds color and a light sea flavor to any dish."
1,"I bought this after reading the reviews about making the Kalua pork.  Wow, tastes so good.  I am impress with the amount of flavor this salt can do on pork.  Yummy.  You got to try the slow cooking method with the liquid smoke."
1,"Wonderful flavor, fantastic color, a must have for the kitchen!  This is sure to please that hard to buy for individual or couple."
1,I'll add another 5 star review!  I absolutely love this salt.  I even bring this salt with me when I go to restaurants (I have a small salt grinder).  BUY IT.
1,"I have used this as a rub for pork shoulder that I use to make Kalua pork, and I love it!  No complaints, and I've recommended it to many.  Good product!"
1,"Alaea sea salt contains traces of red clay from the Hawaiian pools where it is condensed. That explains its color, its slowness to dissolve, and its flavor. I have no idea whether the clay adds any nutritional value to the salt, but it has a certain Biblical resonance. ""Clay thou art, Adam!"" In fact, the name 'adam' is derived from the Hebrew word for clay.<br /><br />This is the only 'boutique' sea salt I've come upon that seems well worth the extra cost. It's extremely tasty on heirloom tomatoes. It looks appetizing on steaks and chops, sprinkled at the last moment before serving. It's something to reserve for ""finishing"" and ""plating"" food. A six-ounce jar will last a long time in most kitchens, so this is a decent value.<br /><br />If you live in the South, you might try sprinkling alaea sea salt on the tail of the next ivory-billed woodpecker or Carolina parroquet you see, as a means of clearing the land for development."
1,This is the first and only hawaiian salt Ive ever tried cooking with so I gave it 4 stars because I dont have anything to compare it with. It was absolutely delicious though. I used it on some pork shoulder with liquid smoke and put it in the slow cooker for 20 hours. It came out amazing. Cant wait to try this on different recipes
1,These are by far the best saltine crackers I've eaten.  They are light and airy and have just the right amount of salt.  Very tasty!!!
1,We have not had saltines for many years because of unwanted ingredients.  This brand is yummy and contains no unwanted ingredients.  It was also a lot cheaper by the case than at the local supermarket.
1,"These crackers taste very good. The only problem is I ordered it in mid Oct 2011 and it says on the package that the best before date is 02JAN2012... This is a pack of 6, and each box weights 8 oz crackers. I don't think I will be able to finish 6 boxes in 2 months..."
1,Better than the non-organic store bought brand.  They are crisp and taste fresh.  I will buy this brand again and again.
1,"My husband loves his crackers and he was lamenting one day that the Costco crackers (Premium, big box) just didn't taste as fresh the last time we purchased them, so I went on a cracker buying spree trying to find the ultimate cracker. Lots of taste testing. Bottom line? A cracker, is a cracker, is a cracker. They are all pretty tasty, from the Keebler to the Krispy and the several in between. He liked this brand, but felt they were expensive compared to the Krispy crackers since the taste between the two was almost indistinguishable and the Krispy's were cheaper.<br /><br />BUT, and this is a big BUT...these are ORGANIC! Living in a farming community, I've seen the chemicals poured on wheat when it goes into storage bins (to deter bugs), and believe me, you don't want to eat non-organic wheat. ACK! The stench of the chemical permeates the air surrounding the grain bins when they are pouring that stuff on it. Why we as people poison our food before we eat it--I'll never get that.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a good cracker and I would recommend this product if you want a healthier wheat product--the taste is delicious."
1,"This is an excellent tasting product.  Hooray for Nabisco for putting out an organic saltine!  The cracker is very similar to regular Saltines, only perhaps even better tasting, and I am happy feeding this to my kids."
1,"Reviews on this cracker are delightfully enthusiastic and helpful. A comment by Anne Smiley under Sally Boyd's review intrigued me by noting that the Back to Nature Brand is made by Kraft.<br /><br />If this is so, I wonder why KRAFT didn't think of making [or returning] their name brand cracker like this BACK TO NATURE offering, light and airy MINUS soy and the extra non essential ingredients which take away from flavor, take away from nutrition, and cause people like me to lose faith in name brand foods, indeed to lose faith in and almost dread buying and eating most foods from grocery stores and restaurants, people like me who have been harmed by long term assimilation of anti-nutritional ""extras""?<br /><br />I think I know some of the answers to those questions, figuring out some of it on my own, then adding weight to some of my speculations by reading articles like ""THE DARK SIDE OF CINDERELLA"" by Doctors Mary Enig and Sally Fallon [that article can be read on Dr. Mercola's web site], and by reading books and perusing web sites by honorable medical professionals like Bruce Fife, Carolyn Dean, Mark Sircus, and many more.<br /><br />I know it's hard these days when no one knows what's truly healthy, but too many think they know, and force their ""knowledge"" into the food chain, while attempting to block alternatives. It's hard not only for consumers searching for food which is honestly healthy; it's difficult for food manufacturers and purveyors as well to know what to offer how.<br /><br />Maybe it's wise to focus on what has been remedied to the best interests of all, with products like this soda cracker, however it's packaged, whatever brand it holds, if it's made of only basic, simple, essential whole food ingredients, without adding excess toxic baggage.<br /><br />I like the brand name, packaging, and especially the taste/texture quality of this soda cracker which takes me back to simple days when I was very young...<br /><br />As I began writing this, I was spoon sipping a delicious bowl of steaming <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM2PH0"">Wolfgang Puck Organic Creamy Tomato soup</a>. Each sip contained a few crumbled pieces of these crackers, which I continued adding a few at a time to keep them somewhat crisp.<br /><br />If that flavor, texture, and process doesn't conjure the cozy home feel of ""all's right with the world""... I don't know what would.<br /><br />Thank you, Amazon for making this treat so easily available to me at quantity prices.  Thank you Back to Nature, or Kraft, or both, all who went into allowing me to enjoy this at my kitchen table when my husband was on the road somewhere checking for parts and machinery for equipment for the coal mine where he works.<br /><br />He called me from the road as I was slurping, so I placed the remaining soup in the fridge to concentrate on his voice, knowing the creamy tomato soup made right by these classic saltine crackers would be waiting for me when his voice was temporarily gone again.<br /><br />Real soda crackers are one of the simplest, most basic of comfort foods. They're something to cherish in their simplest natural state. To add anything more to that completeness feels like an incomprehensible intrusion to me.<br /><br />So thankful that righteous minimalism has found its way home again,<br />Linda Shelnutt"
1,Great tasting.  Kids love them and I don't have to worry that there are any genetically engineered ingredients.  A little pricey if you don't care if they are organic.
1,"I was in the grocery store a few weeks ago and found that all the Saltines had chemicals, preservatives, etc.  Some of them deadly.  For example, sodium bisulfite which will keep an apple white for three months.  Never used to be in Saltines and now is.<br /><br />Purchased the Back to Nature Organic Saltines.  They are absolutely perfect.  We are on our fourth case.  Some saltines do not have soda in them - they are useless for any acid reflux sufferer but Back to Nature Organic Saltines do have soda and  I noticed I was able to cut back on my Gavison. This is not medical advice but the crackers work for my family.  Taste great, not too salty and we intend to purchase them on a regular basis.<br /><br />It is getting more and more difficult to find chemical free products.  Thanks to amazon for helping its customers find products that we can feel good about eating."
0,I regret to buy this here....The crackers are short-dated. I finally find somewhere online that sells it for less than $5/box. Don't buy it here.<br />But the cracker tasted good.
1,These are great crackers. No chemicals or junk in them. I don't feel guilty for giving them to my husband.
1,"Much like others have said here, I absolutely love saltines but due to the terrible ingredients I just could not buy them anymore. While there are plenty of good healthy crackers on the market these days, none come close to the classic saltine style I grew up with - until these. They really taste just like the classics. Simple and healthful ingredients, a perfect texture - no weird overly crispiness or off tastes. Great plain, with a little cheese or tossed on top of a bowl of soup. These 8 ounce boxes contain 2 separate packages of crackers, much like the classic boxes in stores today would have 4 packages (though these are a little shorter). Highly recommended."
1,These are by far the best-tasting saltines on the market. They are flaky and crisp and not too salty. They are very high quality and I bet you will like them if you like saltines.
1,"These are so airy and delicate.  Really enjoyable.  You tend to eat them slower and with more purpose, knowing they aren't the ""everyday"" cheap, chemical laden crackers.  Was really surprised at their lightness.  Very enjoyable.  Will buy these from now on."
1,"I love the crackers but was very disappointed with the expiration date. I bought 12 boxes figuring they would last me for 6-12 months. Unfortunately, the expiration date on the boxes was July, 2010. That's only 2-3 months. That is not reasonable."
1,I HAD STOPPED EATING SALTINE CRACKERS BEFORE I FOUND THESE BECAUSE OF THE UNHEALTHY INGREDIENTS. THESE ARE GREAT TASTING.....LIGHT AND CRISP. NOT TOO MUCH SALT. KEEP THEM COMING !
1,"ok, so i'm not going to knock these too hard.<br /> i initially bought them because i'm currently to busy to drag my butt to the g.store.<br /> they would be a better deal as a pack of 12 rather than 6.<br /> the quality and taste is almost exact to the krispy brand my grandmother buys.<br /> these just cost too much and i cant find the quality here for the price paid."
1,Very interesting product to get delivered directly to the house.  Uber-GOURMET fun to have.  But be warned --  it is not ALCOHOL free.  This is a fermented product.
1,"I'm a soldier in Afghanistan, and there is nothing more fun than watching the expression in an Afghan child's face when they try Pop Rocks for the first time... The adults love them too!"
1,"The company is great.  The candy was great.  I got it as part of a ""remember when"" Christmas gift.  As a kid it seemed more powerful. Now, it's just candy."
0,"Having ordered pop rocks for a group of students over a year ago, it seemed like a good idea to order the 36 pack for a new group this fall. The order was placed in early August. It is currently September and although I have written Amazon for resolution and they responded nicely, the order of pop rocks has yet to arrive. The rocks were needed for a fun way to introduce science lab books to a group of fifth graders. Do be careful from whom you order."
1,"Pop Rocks are the best candies I've tried. Don't get me wrong, I'm italian, spanish, and german and I love these candy. When negative reviews come, don't listen to them. Try using these candies on soda. Don't hesistate; Just Buy it! I'm also a heavy metal person. Gift these to heavy metal people."
1,I call them diet candy because each packet is less than 40 calories.  My kids love them too.
1,I tried this coffee in a Keurig and absolutely loved it.  I don't personally own a Keurig so I looked for it for my regular coffee maker.  I would definitely order it again.
1,"Product was fresh and I would order from amazon again. It's cheaper than the retail stores. It's a nice medium blend, not too light but not too dark either."
1,"I am very picky with coffee. I really dislike the super strong blends that leave a nasty aftertaste, are bitter, and require lots of cream to stomach. According to a recent Starbucks survey 40% of Americans actually don't like the super strong bold type coffee - well count me as part of that 40%. I like a mild to medium blend with a nice flavor without any bitterness.<br /><br />I've tried MANY of the mild or medium roast blends. Until I found Caribou Coffee  I thought there was nothing out there for me - and I did all sorts of things just to have a cup of joe to enjoy (mixing hot water in, adding flavored creamers, and so on). I alternate this coffee with the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002O62H5E"">Caribou Coffee Blend Ground, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a>. Both are outstanding. I've bought bag after bag of this and it's always the same great coffee. Not the cheapest coffee - but for me absolutely worth the price. No need for any flavored creamers - this one has fantastic flavor on its own!"
0,"I bought this hoping to use it for lemons and limes. Last night I needed to juice a lemon, so tried it out. It broke. Am going back to my tried-and-true glass juicer."
1,I tried this on a whim at a organic food store- it was so unbelievably good!  It was a total surprise and I ate it straight from the package.  The only problem I see with this product is portion control!  It is that good!
1,"This product is to die for. It heals the skin from the inside out. My only concern in recommending it so highly is that everyone will buy it, and I will have a difficult time getting it."
1,"Franks xtra red hot is delicious and hot.  I'm not really sure how else I can describe it for a review.  If you like hot, delicious stuff then do it."
1,"I can never find this in stores, and it is so nice to find it in the 12oz size! Previously could only get it in the 7oz size. I use it like ketchup!!"
1,"I love mustard & have tried so many different types/brands and this is without a doubt my favorite mustard.  However, it is very spicy, so be fore-warned if you don't like spicy foods.  The taste of this mustard is so delicious that I put it on chicken & seafood before grilling or broiling.  I love this mustard so much that I am always on the lookout for recipes that will allow me to incorporate it. If you like very spicy and delicious mustard, then this is the mustard for you."
1,I have bought this in the whole bean form in the past but the price was fantastic I thought I would try the ground version. I is very good and tasts just as fresh as the beans. I will most likely buy the beans as I like the ritual of grinding and brewing. Since ordering Cafe Excellence coffees I have noticed that the price has jumped a little to high for me so will keep and eye out for when the price is more reasonable as when I ordered it at first.
1,"Good for what it is - but it will never match fresh product.  On the other hand, fresh product is not shelf-stable."
1,I am really enjoying these preserves.  My southern mother-in-law used to make her own pear preserves and they were to die for.  The Blue Ridge ones are the closest to hers I've been able to find anywhere on the market.  Thank you very much for making such an excellent product.
1,"Thats exactly what you want, and no darker. Thats one of the things that makes this<br />company so special, they do it right.<br /><br />I'm fortunate enough to have a specialty store here in St. Augustine that carries a<br />whole variety of Blue Ridge Jams. I had the Habanero Peach and Habanero Pineapple and<br />was hooked. They are both great on just a cracker with cream cheese, but I did make a<br />milkshake with the pineapple and it was about the best thing I've ever had.<br /><br />But these Pears, WOW! Reminds me of the preserves my grandmother and mom made. They<br />are packed with fruit, are just sweet enough, and have that wonderful velvety consistency<br />all good preserves should have. I reserve these strictly for buttered biscuits, croissants,<br />and toast, but I'm sure there are a dozen other uses.<br /><br />Its a small company that prides itself in quality and creativity. Go to blueridgejams(dot)<br />com for more info and high res photos of the entire product line."
1,"This is very good honey, full of probiotics, and the taste is fantastic... only wish it was<br />a bit more affordable and glass jars would be nice."
1,"these are lower in fat and calories than chips and seem to satisfy better than regular chips.  Try them, you'll like em"
1,"I love Bagel Spice. Ever since I first heard about it from Hungry Girl, I was hooked. so happy they keep developing new flavors. I recently purchased the newest with Sea Salt, it's fantastic. A perfect addition to an egg scramble, salad, mashed potatoes, and so on. I often use the spicy mix when preparing seafood."
1,"Great for making Cuban Bagels. Make a cream cheese sandwich with fresh Cuban bread. Smush down and place under broiler, melt a little butter on top and sprinkle with Bagel spice. Yum!"
1,"Yep, this is A LOT of curry powder, but if you use it often in cooking, it really is a better price than paying several dollars for a tiny bottle (even McCormick's own tiny bottle) that'll be gone in no time - or worse, make you feel like you have to ration it.  I like curry powder and for once in my life, I wanted to use it and not feel I must skimp.  I paid just under $11 and in about a month, I've used maybe 3/4 of an ounce (I saved an empty 1 oz bottle to keep a more manageable portion on the spice rack).  Like another reviewer said, it IS possible it tastes a bit different from the 1 oz version, but I couldn't say for certain, and moreover, I don't think it's bad - I'm using it, mainly on rice dishes.  To me, it's legions better than <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007B9JCFM"">Taste Specialty Foods Hot Curry Powder, 16-Ounce</a> but not as good as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MXTMZO"">Rajah Mild Madras Curry Powder 100g</a>.<br /><br />Google ""curry powder health benefits"" and you'll find plenty of results; it's best known for its benefits to digestion and for anti-inflammatory qualities, but also said to boost memory and protect against Alzheimer disease and cancer.<br /><br />Ingredients: Coriander, Fenugreek, Turmeric, Cumin, Black Pepper, Bay Leaves, Celery seed, Nutmeg, Cloves, Onion, Red Pepper, Ginger.<br /><br />The expiration, I'm pleased to note since there is so darn much of this(!), is April 2014."
0,"I have tried at least a dozen different curry powders in the last several weeks and found that the McCormick 1 oz bottle is the very best by far.  Based on that, I purchased the 16-ounce bottle I saw on Amazon.  I was surprised when I found that the taste of the 16-ounce product was very different, to the point of not being able to use it."
1,"Not only is the price great, but the product tastes awesome on chicken!!  Not to mention the health benefits.  I hope it stays around long enough for me to order when I'm out, which will be awhile thanks to the size."
1,"I haven't bought this order, but I received a tin of these mints as a present and they are the greatest. these tiny mints have an incredibly full and sweet berry flavor that gets me through the day at work! Would be so cute for a party!"
0,"It is seriously a bad taste.  No matter what we do, it tastes bad.  Bought the Orange and it is the most horrible taste.  Even when we put 1/2 a bottle in a gallon of orange juice, it takes bad, let alone when we put the whole bottle into the gallon mix of crystal light.  Do not waste your money."
1,"I have been drinking Whey Up since 2007 and I LOVE IT!  There is not another protein energy drink on the market that tastes as good or works as well.  I drink at least one Whey UP a day and can certainly feel my energy levels increase when i drink it before a work out.  It's also been a great source of meal replacement with 20g of protein and again, it tastes GREAT!<br /><br />I even pack bottles of WHEYUP when I travel and have gone to great measures to get more WHEY UP if i run out.  People who work out should drink WHEYUP for the protein energy boost they get before going to the gym.  I have also pointed out to people that are dieting that they should drink WHEYUP as a meal replacement (once a day) and then keep filling the bottle with water for the rest of the day.<br /><br />I love that AMAZON is now selling WHEY UP and everyone should try it!"
1,"I found this at QT and love it! I like the berry one the best. It's a great way to get the protein I need, plus the caffeine I want. The berry has a great flavor, so much better than other powdered or chocolate/vanilla flavored 'shakes'. Love it!"
1,"I discovered WheyUp 4 years ago after having bariatric surgery. It's a challenge to consume 60 grams of protein when your stomach is the size of a golf ball. Protein drinks are one of the best ways. The problem is, I hated the taste of every one... until WheyUp! I love the taste and I also love the caffeine. Having reached my goal weight, the challenge to ingest enough protein is still there! I like to have 1/2 before my morning workout and the other 1/2 immediately after.<br />I almost didn't write this review because I'm selfish and I wanted to make sure it's always in stock!"
1,"I grabbed one of these at QT a few days ago, and have loved them ever since.  As I'm writing this, they're unavailable on amazon, but I'm diligently checking as I'll be ordering a lot when they start selling them.<br /><br />I use this as a light, high protein pre workout drink, and I love that it has caffeine as that really helps me push myself in my early morning workouts.  I've tried milk+whey, but it was too heavy for me and always seemed to sit on my stomach and make me feel sluggish as I was trying to lift.  I've also tried water+whey, but mannnn that tastes horrendous and I just have a hard time doing it.  And neither of those have caffeine, which I think really helps to energize me.  So far I've tried the grape and berry, and liked both.  I haven't tried any of the other flavors.<br /><br />This does taste a little tiny bit bitter at times, and definitely isn't as good tasting as a protein shake, but it's perfect otherwise.  And you're not really drinking it for the taste anyways, are you?  Grab one of these, lift a lot of heavy weight up and down as many times as you can, follow up with a post-workout shake, rest and repeat, and you'll get strong.  Highly recommended!"
1,"... I wished they didn't raise its price recently..<br />Now, it's cheaper to buy it at the store (around $7.69)."
1,this is the best tea. brew it in a porcelain teapot and use a small glass for drinking. enjoy it...
1,"Pretty good stuff for the money.  Very fragrant, nice aroma.  Only complaint is includes artificial as well as natural bergamot flavoring.  Eh, my palate is not discerning enough to note the difference, but I have to wonder ... why not all natural?"
1,"My old favorite was Jasmine tea but ever since someone gave me one of these teabags to try this has been my new favorite.  I love the taste and aroma, although if you don't keep it in an airtight container it loses its potency.  Regardless, I need to order the 100 teabag size everytime because I go through it quite often.  This last time I ordered from Sadaf directly, they sent me a keychain and a tiny box of Special Blend with Cardamom (5 teabags).  I really appreciated that.  It's little things like that which will keep me coming back - even if I don't enjoy the Cardamom Tea sample!  I didn't realize Amazon sold this brand and I hope they get some of this in soon.<br /><br />FYI - I noticed on the Sadaf website that they now have a Special Blend Jasmine tea as well.  I'm definitely going to try that next time I order some of my Special Blend with Earl Grey!<br /><br />Also, as a side note, I drink this sometimes with a little lemon juice and sometimes with a tiny amount of orange juice added.  Either way it's delicious and unique... as it is just plain."
1,"Love this hot chocolate and it can be hard to find.  The spices in the cocoa blend really create a warm, enjoyable hot drink any time of the year."
1,"I have a lot of allergies, so I am often making things from scratch for myself. One of the things I have to make is chocolate, and these little cocoa butter bits are perfect for blending in with baker's chocolate to get a smooth, shiny base. I'm also working on a white chocolate recipe and cinnamon roll frosting with them. Very good for the money."
1,"Love it! My favorite usage of this wonderful product is to add it to my morning porridge. For example, try semolina/yellow corn grits/cocoa butter chips or semolina/barley/cocoa butter chips. Of course you add the chips when the porridge is ready, you don't cook them. Enjoy!"
1,"I love chai and raspberries, put together they are heavenly.  Big Train makes many drinks that I like, and this is no exception, in fact this may be my favorite.  There is convenience in the single serving, and the price through Amazon is much better than I could get locally."
1,Very tasty and smells great! Very convenient packaging. I love this. I just wish they had a version of it that was organic.
1,"Easy to prepare and almost healthy, a nice alternative to thos pricey pre-mixed bottled beverages."
1,"Wow this one whisks up really nicely! Granted I am getting better at whisking and making a nice froth on top of my matcha but this one was easy peasy! I have noticed some matcha flavors mix more easily than others for some reason and since I do make more than one matcha many days its not just due to me being better one day versus another. This one whisked up to a very full forth quite easily! I note this because I know froth is really something many of us struggle with especially when we are new to matcha so I wanted to make a note of it for those of you who may feel deflated by not getting a good foam. Get this one and you can feel stellar! lol<br /><br />Now as for taste, I am not one who has had a lot of passion fruit in their life, other than in smoothies I have got from smoothie places and those are usually so riddled with sugars and other fruits picking out the passion fruit itself was a little difficult especially not having passion fruit in and of itself.<br /><br />Now I get to taste real passion fruit! Yay!<br /><br />It has a bit of this natural rind like flavor similar to that you sometimes get in a mango or papaya. Fruits I do have personal experience with. I like it though - it really compliments the natural grassy like flavor of the matcha base! And contrary to the smoothies I have had its not that sweet. There is a tart flavor to it but not bitter. It tastes REALLY healthy, and while matcha is always healthy sometimes I feel guilty having my dessert like matcha lol although I shouldn't such as my favorite butterscotch mathca makes me feel like I'm cheating haha this one makes me feel like I am really doing something good for my body and trust me my body needs all the help it can get!<br /><br />The aroma of this one is really quite nice! It is very eye opening and even if its only a mental thing I sure can use that in the mornings!<br /><br />There is the after taste of the rind like flavor but the passion fruit flavor makes my mouth water for more, literally, as if the juices itself are pulling out the watery mouth sensation! Its strange but nice. Its like having a mouth full of juicy passion fruit!<br /><br />So I drank half of my matcha straight, then added some sparkling italian water and some sweet cream non dairy creamer to make an italian soda and OMG goodness! The flavors ERUPT into a juicy fruit gum sensation which is similar in some ways to the brandy matcha I am going to review next! It is different though as the brandy also has alcohol notes to it whereas this one does not. This is like the virgin variable you give your kids while you have the brandy one haha. Except this has that lovely awakening rind flavor in the background that lingers in the after taste."
1,"I've had ""passionfruit"" flavored teas that tasted nothing like passionfruit. Red Leaf's passionfruit matcha is not one of them. This delicious tropical fruit flavor definitely shines alongside the base matcha. I prefer this matcha cold, though I plan to try it hot come winter. It'll be perfect for summer daydreaming, because there's something about the flavor of passionfruit that screams summer. It's well captured in this matcha. The flavor isn't heavy, but I do find that just the slightest touch of milk/cream really rounds out the cup. Another hit from Red Leaf!"
0,"These don't have an appropriate texture to be called ""cookies"". The ingredients aren't blended well, so it feels more like a granola bar to me, and I've always hated granola bars (even when I was unaware of their harmful effects on human health). They also smell artificially, which interferes with the perception of their taste... although I can't tell if they have any taste, besides some sweetness. Where did orange, ginger, and chocolate go?<br /><br />It's also irritating that the manufacturer doesn't talk about the ingredients in a simple and straightforward manner. Why say ""low glycemic monosaccharide"" and ""low glycemic fruit concentrate""? Admit that it is FRUCTOSE. It is not enough to say ""vegetable fiber"". They are supposed to know exactly WHAT KIND of fiber they use, because it makes a difference."
1,"These taste GREAT. These don't have gluten. These are lower carb. These have no sugar. JACKPOT!<br /><br />I searched quite a while to find a treat/snack/dessert that I could enjoy on my diet and my once-sugar-addict hubby could enjoy so he doesn't feel deprived. I do carb controlled ""Primarian"" type dieting (mostly protein and veggies, with some cheese/yogurt, fruit and nuts/nut butters, no sugar (rarely, anyway), no gluten. I've given up most grains and have lost 110 lbs. Hubby is nearly underweight eating this way, so he gets extra snacks/treats.) So, I really had a hard time finding certain convenient (ie, I don't have to make it!) dessert items. These cookies solved my dilemma.<br /><br />I like the Orange Ginger Chocolate best, followed by the Island Lime. I found the peanut butter ones had a weird oily flavor. My super picky hubby likes the Cinni-Apple Spice. We've reordered these multiple times in the last few months, usually 4 or 6  bags at a time of EACH the three flavors. It gets really expensive, but it consolidates shipping. At 2 to 3 cookies at a time as a post-dinner or post-lunch dessert, it keeps me sane. Seriously, while I love fruit for dessert, sometimes, I just want me something that TASTES like I'm having pure old-fashioned junk. :D<br /><br />The texture is the only thing that could be improved on my fave two flavors. (I find the Cinni-Apple spice fine, but blander than I prefer, hence my preference for the others.) Some batches are nicely crispy. Others are chewy and stuck-together. I think they don't handle transport in the summer heat too well or the moisture levels in summer, cause my order earlier in the year were much nicer (ie, during the cooler/drier months). But even with the chewier texture and less crispness the flavor shines.<br /><br />Island Lime is mis-named. They should just call it Coconut Citrus. It's mostly coconut. It tasted 90% coconut to me with a hint of the citrus. Suits me fine. I adore coconut cookies (ie, the old sugary ones I used to get). So, if you expect heavy lime, sorry. If you love coconut, go for it. I judge most items I buy by the first five ingredients. Sure, the others count, but those are the BULK of what makes a lot of items, so here goes for Island Lime: Almonds, whey protein concentrate, unsweetened coconut, egg whites, vegetable fiber.  Very low-carb friendly stuff. It's 79 calories per serving of 2 cookies, 4 grams of fiber, 1 sugar, and 2 grams of protein.<br /><br />My fave, the Orange Ginger Chocolate taste like a bit of chocolate met a bit of Cointreau and had a baby. It's not a heavy choco taste. It's not really all that gingery. Just a bit. And the citrus reminds me of my earlier years when I sipped Cointreau at parties. Same texture issues, but the taste is a treat to me with coffee. Really satisfies. The nutritional profile didn't please me as much as the Island Lime, but hey, you sometimes just need that treat. First Five: Almonds, Whey protein concentrate, egg whites, vegetable fiber, maltodextrin.  It's 74 calories for 2 cookies (an acceptable amount on my 1200 to 1400 calorie diet), and it has 3 grams of fiber,  1 sugar, and 3 grams of protein per serving.<br /><br />I don't get intestinal distress like I do with some low-carb/diet stuff with sugar substitutes, which is another bonus. And the fiber content pleases me, too.<br /><br />If you miss having cookie on your diet and need to avoid gluten, here ya go. Enjoy.<br /><br />I would note that Netrition has a better price on these and reasonable shipping. Wish Amazon would stock and sell these. I order these a lot and it would save me loads to get it on my Prime list of items. Oh, well. Worth trying, no matter the vendor."
1,"They have a sweet and ever so slightly tart, cherry vanilla flavor. I really like the flavor, I just wish it were a tiny bit stronger.  I leave them in a jar for my kids to enjoy, especially after snacks and meals.  Guilt-free and good for your teeth.  All in all, a great lollipop with pretty, swirly colors too."
0,"Not very sweet. Very bland, and in my opinion too expensive for the product. Flavorless, doesn't taste like you're having a treat but the amount of carbs is high."
0,The taste is like a bitter cherry. I don't like them but my kids do. Good be a little sweeter!
1,Great for babies learning to taste and enjoy food.  I never thought he would love vegetables so much.  He loves these!
1,"My son loves the Gerber baby foods, and this pack saves me from having to buy individual containers.  There aren't any additives and these actually taste like the real foods.  Some other baby foods just don't taste right.  These containers are also reusable, and they don't break like the jars do."
0,The food is great and convenient to get it in an assorted pack but 18 pack means 9 PACKS OF 2. This is not a good deal and you can get these items for less as an individual purchase from almost any store.
1,Great for the price.  Don't bake too long or you won't have the runny lava center.  Very quick & easy & comes with it's own little pans.
1,"At 2 fat grams per cake I was very skeptical of the taste of this product, but I was quite happily surprised.  I'm a total choco-phile and I'm always looking for ways to get my fix without the all-consuming waistline guilt.<br /><br />It's not as decadent as what you'll get in a restaurant but then again those babies pack anywhere from 20-50 grams of fat per cake.  Let's not even TALK about the calories!<br /><br />I've tried both the plain chocolate and the mint chocolate version of this product and both are VERY good.  I recommend it for anyone, but particularly for choco-holics who don't want to consume a whole day's fat allowance in one shot! ;)"
1,"This cake was a very rich chocolate in the middle.<br />It was the family's first lava cake.<br /><br />So, if you love rich chocolate,<br />this is for you.<br /><br />I am going to bake the next one<br />longer to please the family.<br /><br />It is very quick & easy to do,<br />with a very good price!<br /><br />I bought this only for an occasional<br />treat as we are attempting to eliminate<br />processed foods.<br /><br />It just looked good, and it was!"
1,"I lost faith in my long time cat food, Science Diet, after the massive pet food recall.  Fromm claims this dry food is made in the US (Wisconsin) from meat, cheese and vegetables bought from local growers.  Quality meats, no glutens, fresh vegetables and human quality vitamins.  The cats like it.  It is more expensive than Science Diet, but not prohibitively so.  Note:  the Milwaukee newspaper advises the canned Fromm is made in China.  I have absolutely no faith in the Chinese quality and safety control standards so I would not buy the canned foods."
0,"Although this is listed as a 5-lb (225 kg) bag, it is NOT.  It is only a 2.5 lb (1.1kg) bag.  Believe me, I very carefully checked the shipping weight in the description when I ordered it because it was a good price.  That has been changed in the few days since I placed the original order, however the main listing heading has not been changed. VERY misleading."
0,"I've submitted this review once before, and it appears to have been deleted.  Even odder, the description of the product has been changed to make it even more misleading.<br /><br />This is NOT a 5 LB bag, it is a 2.5 LB bag, which means you're paying twice as much per ounce as you should.  This is a comparable price for the 5 LB bag.  The seller needs to change both the description and the picture, otherwise they're going to keep cheating customers.<br /><br />All of that is a shame, really, because this is a very high quality food that my cats love. I recommend this kibble highly."
1,"Vya Sweet Vermouth elevates your mixed drink beyond expectations!  I just discovered this brand's Vermouth this past week off the internet blogs.  I'd been plowing thru other Vermouth brands adjusting my Manhattans.  This one is spectacular.<br /><br />I'm going out tomorrow to hunt down their Dry and Whisper Dry for my Martini's, and I think this one is going to be my favorite gift to give for the forseeable future!  This will be fun to introduce to my friends.<br /><br />Buy stock!  Via can only get more popular.  As I said...spectacular."
1,This is such a great way to buy cereal and this is a way that I can help my mother who lives on a very fixed low income. I can buy her food and have it shipped directly to her home and then she has food and does not have to get out in the cold Colorado weather and bad roads to get to the grocery store to buy her groceries. I hope that Amazon continues to work with companies and expand their groceries so that I can do more fo her
1,"What can I say? It doesn't get anymore basic than corn flakes! The way I see it, Kellogg's has corn flakes and general mills has cheerios. then there's honey nut cherrios and frosted flakes, 2 great cereals originating from 2 classic cereals!"
0,"When did the rooster on the box get a cartoony face? Whatever happened to that wonderful abstraction? First they ruined Tony the Tiger, now this.<br /><br />And where did all the high fructose corn syrup come from? Admittedly, it is a flake of corn but that is a nasty ingredient to be skipped at all costs.<br /><br />It's things like that which drive people to the formerly odd grains like spelt and kamut!"
0,"Admittedly, I had a fever.<br /><br />And I must say I am a devotee of the Corn Flake (though I only eat Trader Joe's Brand--Kellogg's flakes, though tasty, have too much crap in them).<br /><br />But Cereal City--the true target of this review--and a place that now has GREAT bearing on my thoughts about this product--was CREEPY.<br /><br />From the bald lady with two teeth who took our ticket and felt that this gave her liscense to engage us in a too-long conversation, to the Pennywise-looking clown that reeked of smoke--our first two minutes set the tone.<br /><br />Throw in a weird new-agey film with floating balls of light that became speaking versions of dead historic figures who never got along in life and pick up their arguments right where they left off on the screen.<br /><br />Add to that a poorly-lit animatronic Snap, Crackle, and Pop who end up either looking like they are rising from the grave or falling in worship at the feet of Tony the Tiger (depending on whether they are coming up or going back down).<br /><br />Our (hopefully) unique experience involved not being able to find a lady crucial to our scavanger hunt for 45 minutes (did she go in back and take a nap?) I want a shirt that says ""I waited 45 minutes to complete the Cereal City scavanger hunt and all I got was this crappy sippy cup.""<br /><br />Sadly there is much, much more...I could go on at length. But I won't.<br /><br />The main point is that I get the sense that Kellogg's, as a company, is just as creepy as its tourist trap. Avoid both."
0,i was expecting this product to be like the picture and come in a small beer stein mug but it was plain jars of mustard. the mustard is fine but the picture is deceiving and i was buying the product for the glass beer stein as a present. not was i wanted.
1,"I am SUPER picky about my flavored milk, it has to taste just right and for the longest time I have been looking for a vanilla milk mix or syrup that tastes any good at all. This is is! I was surprised when I first opened it because the syrup is very clear and looks thin, but boy does it pack a flavor punch. It's great, I'm sorry I only ordered one bottle. Good stuff!"
1,"The Fox's U-Bet Vanilla Syrup is great that I ordered.  The people I ordered from mixed the order up, and shipped the wrong quantity.  Even though I e-mailed them several times, they never got back to me at all.  So I still received the wrong order."
1,"My husband absolutely loves vanilla egg creams but living in California, these are hard to come by!  With his birthday coming up, I wanted to surprise him with a genuine (vanilla) egg cream.  However, I had no idea how to make one!  So after doing a bunch of research  on all this, I found out it was essential to use UBet's Vanilla syrup.  Well, guess what, I did as recommended, followed the making of one down to the letter, and boy oh boy... not only was my husband thrilled, I now LOVE vanilla egg creams! This syrup is also great as a flavoring in sodas.  I highly recommend anyone to give it a try!"
1,"This is a good basic vanilla syrup. I have used it as a sweetener for coffee, and added it to sparkling water to make a respectable cream soda. The price is excellent, after comparing it to Torani and DaVinci syrups."
1,"Thank you, thank you, thank you for your wonderful vanilla syrup.  The Shop Rite stores in my area can't keep it on the shelves.  For me, it's a life saver as it helps me to get my 6 year old to drink her milk.  Sometimes, I have a glass myself. Yum!"
1,"I'm on a low budget, a lot of it consisting of canned foods like campbells chunky firehouse hot and spicy chili. Like the other reviews available mentioned, it is NOT spicy by any real standards. For anyone who's been to a curry house chain restaurant, and ordered ""hot"" and not extra/super hot, you'll realize the definition of hot is rapidly changing to fit the more moderate group of individuals. If I'm really trying to save money that week, I just have a can a day. Half a can with rice, for lunch, and half a can with rice for dinner. I prefer to have it with long grain rice since its generally a bit dryer and goes better with the liquidy nature of the chili. I eat it with cheetos flaming hot chips, not the healthiest diet by any means, but it is a VERY cheap meal, and tastes great with the combination of things. What I like most about the chili is its high fiber content, I'm not one for eating a lot of vegetables, so the fiber in this really helps."
1,"This is decent tasting for a canned chili.  However, the people who say it's hot obviously don't eat a lot of spicy food.  I'd put it in a low medium heat category for chili."
1,"i like chili but i have not tasted too many great ones. this chili is great. it tastes like a spicy version of the chili that i eat from the restaurant ""Chilis"", but for a fraction of the price. If you're looking to burn the hell out of your mouth, this isn't the chili for you, i can see how some can be disapointed. this is a spicy chili but not a ""too hot"" spicy chili, just moderate. if you're looking for a great chili with some moderate kickback, this is a 4-5 star cheap go-to canned chili, the best ive tasted! if you're looking for a super spicy chili, that lives up to the name ""firehouse"", you will have to look elsewhere, this doesn't even make me want water, but at the same time, it leaves my mouth feeling nice and spicy fresh, i wont go back to ""regular"" now."
0,"This used to be one of my favorite canned foods, now the meat is rubbery.  It was not like this before they reduced the can size to 15 oz.  Barely edible."
1,"I LOVE hot chili.  In my opinion chili should be HOT,  otherwise all you've got is bean soup with hamburger in it.  This chili is all that and more.  I decided to try it without adding my usual hot stuff to everything I eat.  I was pleasently suprised to find my eyes sweating and having to stop to blow my nose.<br /><br />  BUY THIS BY THE CASE!!!"
1,"My husband believes that this particular chili soup is better than his home made chili, which he will never make again as long as he can keep a supply of the Firehouse Hot & Spicy Chili on hand.  It is full of flavor,beef and beans and we have used it as a topping for baked potatoes. It is spicy, so if you don't like food that's spicy, don't buy this soup.  I have no idea how the other chili Campbell soups taste.  However, this is a winner."
1,"This is a real hot and spicy chili. If you find it too hot, try the Campbell's Chunky Roadhouse Chili."
1,"So many TJ's items ~ so little money and they are so far away. I was thrilled to find these <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U8CSW6"">Chocolate Orange Sticks</a> at Amazon.com and ordered them right away. Delicious dark chocolate with orange gel inside that has a perfect tanginess. Highly recommended!"
1,"Score another hit from Trader Joe's. These chocolate orange sticks are delicious.<br />We buy them and put them in gift baskets for friends or colleagues, or sometimes take them to the office to open up on my husband's desk to share.<br />Orange and chocolate is an interesting flavor blend, and most people find it to be delicious. The price here is more than you'll pay in your local store, though."
1,"I have tried chai's from many different latte' stands.  It was hit and miss when it came to taste.  Luckily, my barista and my local stand told me it was the mix and not necessarily the barista.  She told me they used Big Train Chai.  She was right.  I can now make my own chai's at home using Big Train Chai that are as good as what I get from the latte' stands and have cut my morning chai addiction costs considerably."
0,"so got the package, and through my own fault for not reading everything got hit with over $12 in shipping charges.  Really, don't know about you but to me, that is way too much.  So open the bag of tea... no scoop... directions read in hot water put 2 sccops in... no scoop... huh?  Was just informed they don't put a scoop in every bag... what???  So while I may enjoy the tea... forget it, last time I buy from this company.<br /><br />The old buyer beware is how I would rate this company."
1,"My doctor recommended I use this formula as a supplement for my son. My son was not a premie but at 6lbs 2oz he wasn't breaking the scale either so the extra calories in this formula are perfect for him. Also for some reason he has no trouble going back and forth from breast milk to the Neosure formula, my daughter struggled quite a bit when I introduced formula in her diet, it wasn't the Neosure. Bottom line is I have been very happy, and so has my little boy."
1,"LaCosta Gourmet's customer service is incredibly wonderful.  Tonight, I ordered only one pound of coffee that needed to be delivered in two days.  I tried to order it with upgraded shipping but, after I got Amazon's confirmation, it showed standard shipping and could take 8 days, given the intervening federal holiday and weekend.  Seeing that, I emailed La Costa Gourmet to see if the shipping could be upgraded to 2-day.  Within five minutes--I kid you not, 5 minutes!!!, Jeff at La Costa Gourmet called me, assuring that the order was due to go out first thing in the morning and is expected to arrive in two days, no need for an additional shipping fee.  I know that the order for one pound of coffee seems like a small matter but, it is for a family member heading overseas.  This small matter was very important to me and obviously very important to La Costa Gourmet.  They have earned my undying loyalty for customer service, great communication, & not ripping me off for an additional shipping fee."
1,"This product is by far one of the best cookies this universe has ever known. Tiny TRON discs of delicate and balanced crunch and chocolate that ebbs and flows like a dream landscape, reality becomes liquid candles and you are the wick... set yourself ablaze and eat these cookies.<br /><br />They really are the best cookies, I'd place them side by side with those LU Cookies Le Petit Ecolier, The Little Schoolboy which can also be bought here on Amazon.<br /><br />Why settle for boring cookies when you can eat the best?"
1,"My spring diet consists of meat from Schwan's, pickles, mushrooms and these Jalapenos. The 24 cans last 3 months. I enjoy the mild sting and the many carrot slices."
1,"If you want a true jalapeno,taste look no futher,we love these!! can use them in so many ways,we have opened a can and even put them on subs and sanwiches,i also used the in making spanish chicken and beef dishes!! will buy again!"
1,"These are sliced the long way, so they make nice strips to fold into eggs or drop into soup or whatever. They add a lot of flavor. Jalapenos aren't as hot as serranos. You can use both to get even more flavor. These are a good way to make your food a lot more interesting."
1,"These syrups for Sno Cones are delicious. Our family loves them, we had also purchased a pack of the Hawaiian Ice syrups and we prefer these (and they are cheaper). A very good deal. I will be buying more soon."
1,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT, SWEET TASTY AND THE KIDS LOVE THEM....GREAT FOR PARTIES OR ANY HOT SUMMER DAY....ALL OF THE FLAVORS TASTE GREAT..."
1,These syrups are great for slushes. My kids love them and they are great for summer parties. Very good product.
1,"I have ordered Hawaiian Shaved Ice 10 pint pack for $44 and this time around decided to try Great Northern Polar's 10 pint pack for $29 (both have free Super Saver Shipping).  I was pleasantly surprised and happy with my Great Northern purchases upon testing.  The ten flavors all taste very delicious and I prefer the texture of the shaved ice when G N P's syrup is poured on, as opposed to Hawaiian Shaved Ice's.  I'd definitely recommend this less expensive option for snow cone syrup!!"
1,"I bought a 10 pack of quart bottles of Great Northern syrups for my Polar Ice Cub shaver and they are so good, we all love it.  Well worth it."
1,A very easy process with good communication and the product exactly as advertised.  I particularly appreciate the packing - very secure.
1,"Worth every penny, a little goes a long way.  Ordered these and many snowcones later, still have plenty.  The taste is awesome, and the thicker syrup covers the ice great."
1,"I bought a 10 pack of this snow cone syrup for my grandchildren & they just love it. The taste is great & it's nice having it already to go, no mixing. I would/will be buying from them again."
1,I had recently bought an Hawaiian Ice Machine from Great Northern which we love.  The kids loved the flavors and the added cones and straws are an added bonus.  A little pricey but delivered to your door and ready to go.
1,"this product is the best in usa , We bought this for our grown-up snow cones. Absolutely yummy. Pour spouts are easy to use Flavours are delicious"
1,"These candies are very good. They have a nice cherry flavor with just a little bit of sour thrown in. Most sour candies made these days make your eyes water and your mouth pucker. Not these gummi's, they have just enough of a sour taste to make them interesting but the sour taste is very very mild.<br /><br />My order came in great condition and very fresh."
1,"We love Haribo.. We already went through Super Coke Bottles and Gummi Bears..<br /><br />We also love sour candy.. and yes the kind that makes your lips pucker.. :-)<br /><br />I was disappointed at the ""sour-ness"" of  Sour Cherries..<br /><br />but...<br /><br />the family will find it in their heart to consume them.. unlike the<br /><br />Pink Grapefruit which I will be giving away.."
1,i ate this whole bag in like 3 days.  if you like the gummy bears you will like these too.  great flavor.
1,"These Haribo sour cherries are vibrantly colored and look like a red cherry on a green stem with a green leaf attached.  Each piece is over an inch long.  They are very cute!<br /><br />Unfortunately, they are sugary sweet and not sour to me at all.  They taste just like those cherry flavored cough drops that come in the red and white box and have no medicinal purposes whatsoever!<br /><br />If you like the flavor of artificial cherries, these are good.  They smell good too.  If you are looking for candies for a kids birthday party, these will definitely be a hit!  If you need a sugary pick-me-up, grab a few and you're set.  But if you really want something more sour, try another kind of Haribo candy.<br /><br />Added thought:  these would be beautiful cake decorations!"
1,"I bought them being familiar with the taste in the past. They taste great and lasted for nearly two weeks between my roommate and I, which is a long time for us."
1,I brought these as a reward for my students and they loved them!  Taste and appearance was A+!  Not too sour - just right!
1,"Finest Teutonic gummy candy. If you ever tried this you know what it is and you are getting your credit card right now.<br />6 out of 5 stars. Yes, they are that good."
1,"I bought several bags of these... filled them in a giant jar, and my roommates and friends went through 25 pounds in a month.  Yes, that's right, in one month.  That's testimony for how amazing and delicious Haribo can make gelatin taste...."
1,These cherries are sour and chewy. Just writing about them makes my mouth water as if I were thinking of sucking on a lemon. You have to like sour things to enjoy these. But they are pretty nice if you do love sour flavors.
0,"i got this bag as part of the TWO bag ""special"", dont like how they rope you into buying two bags to get the Free shipping. making it $28 all together! these cherries are NOT at ALL Sour! Big Bummer! Even worse was that every single one of them in this 5 pound bag were BROKEN. none of them were in one piece, the stem connected to the cherry. i used them for Valentine favors, and they were NOT cute like the raspberries, because they were in parts. the non-saur part was the Big let down. they may have come broken because they were shipped in the Dead of winter. tho they did not sit outside for one second. so not sure if they always come broken. i will NOT be getting these again."
1,So good I am sure this caused the 4 cavities my dentist found all over my teeth. I am a sugar fiend.
1,I have loved this candy since 1980 whe I bought my first bag in Germany and am so happy that I can get it in bulk from Amazon there are many gummy products out there but Haribo Gummi candy is the standard that no one else can meet.
1,These sour cherries are not too sweet and you cannot eat just one.  Great buy
1,"What's not to love about these sour and oh-so chewy candies? Gotta love em to the very last one, though I did by a 5-pound bag for just my household(almost too much) and it was some time before they were finally gone."
0,"These are way too sweet.  I'm a huge fan of Haribo Gold Bears, but this was a real let down.  Large chrystals of sugar overwhelm, with no trace of sour.<br /><br />yuck"
0,"I was very dissapointed with these so called ""Sour Cherry Gummies"", as an avid haribo Gummy Fan, I was expecting at least some type of sour taste, instead just overly sweet and sugar coated, not even much Cherry flavor just very very sweet and overwhelming sugar flavor.<br />If u want some gummies that r sour and tangy, try Fizzy Cola bottles!!<br />They still have sugar coating but a very good, not 2 sweet tangy and tart flavor!! Enjoy...."
0,"Haribo Sour Cherries were disappointing.<br /><br />I expected them to be ""Sour- Tasting"" &<br /><br />they were not. I would not buy them again."
1,"Germans make the best candy.. well from what I can tell with these, YES!  My co-workers ate them all up in about 5 days.... That should tell you the quality.. or not because co-workers will eat anything!  No but seriously they are good.. not very sour.. like I said though. Totally awesome!"
0,"Take note: these are WHOLE WHEAT mixed with quinoa, NOT GLUTEN FREE quinoa. Wasn't made obvious that these were wheat on the sale page. I didn't even know Ancient Harvest made a wheat/quinoa blend. Argh! $25 down the toilet. Learn from my error!"
0,"Well, the Amazon page might show you a nice box regarding celiac awareness month, and lots of gluten-free products, but, Alas, as I found and some have found, this is not a gluten-free product."
0,Agree with all of the other reviewers! I buy the regular quinoa pasta all the time and want even aware that they sold a quinoa/wheat mix. Stuck with a product I cannot eat.
1,"Every complaint says that this product is misrepresented.  However, the box clearly states Organic Whole Wheat - Quinoa Blend.<br />Also, the description on the page states: ""<br />Ingredients<br />Organic Whole Wheat Durum Flour, Organic Quinoa Flour.""<br /><br />I think the reviewers are misrepresenting their search skills and reading ability.  If all else fails, always check the website of Ancient Harvest, or at least find a health foods store and look at the box."
0,"This product closely resembles the gluten free variety and does not do enough to demonstrate the difference. My wife has celiac disease, we bought this inadvertently and cannot return it."
0,"I wanted to order gluten free spaghetti as I had before. This product, with nearly identical packaging, came up in the search results and I failed to notice it was wheat pasta. I discovered this only after opening the box.<br /><br />I donated the 11 unopened boxes to the local food pantry."
1,"I've eaten it with seafood (shrimp, tuna, or salmon) salad, avocado and cream cheese, and preserves and cream cheese. I also like it with mustard."
1,"My brother from NYC introduced these to me last year.  I've purchased and eaten all flavors - they are amazingly crunchy and flavorful!<br />This is a small, family run company - there are just a few hands producing the graphics, cooking the nuts, and packaging them up for our consumption.<br />Their website has some gift options that come in beautifully crafted and unique packaging that are perfect for foodie friends and clients.  We sent them as corporate holiday gifts to some of our clients this year.<br />[...]"
1,"I tried all of the flavors.  Every single one of them is delicious.  The cashews are of high quality, fresh & the flavors are so deliciously different than other cashews I had before.  Even the simple Lightly Salted is not the same as other lightly salted cashews in the market.  Highly recommended!  I even bought the ones with gift packaging for my friends & they all love it!"
1,"Once, years ago whilst working in a faraway land I sat down to eat with a co-worker who had upon his plate a heaping helping of fish bodies swimming in a tomato sauce.  ""What, pray tell, are those"" I queried?  ""Sardines,"" he said, to which I replied ""No.""  We settled the dispute by fishing out the can from the garbage and ascertaining that it did indeed state 'Sardines' on the label.  I was flabbergasted, having had no idea that a sardine can be as large as a plate as th0se were, or as small as a pinkie finger as many of these King Oscar Tiny Tots are....but let's face it:  Nobody wants to eat a humongous sardine.  In fact, doing so is antithetical to the meaning of the small fish, it's oxymoronic, and downright distasteful to do so, possibly even disrespectful.<br /><br />In the years since then whenever I got the craving for sardines I would buy a can of them, usually in mustard sauce, then catch myself thinking that I remembered sardines being tiny fish packed, well, like sardines in a can, and the ones I was buying seemed relatively large....generally as large as the can was wide and meaty such that they would quite overwhelm the saltine cracker I placed them on, and they tasted like fish.  I'm not complaining, I'm from a state that was famous for its sardines and the ones I was eating were often caught and processed there....I just thought that Sardines were, by their nature, tiny.<br /><br />It turns out that the name Sardine is a term similar to Beer.  In other words, lots of different kinds of fish get to be called Sardines but to me and likely to most people, classic sardines are meant to be small and Brisling: The kind of fish that can be stacked two high in a can as small as a sardine can. There is another fish called the Sild harvested in Scotland that is just as or nearly as small which I suppose makes it too a classic sardine, but most of the others that we eat over here in the US are slightly larger with more dark flesh and a fishier taste.  Them are good, but these are better!!!<br /><br />In fact, these are great.  They are great because they are tiny (most are 3"" in length), of delicate white meat (with a section of dark) and a wonderfully neutral sardine flavor that pairs well with a dash of Tabasco and a Saltine.<br /><br />Even better than their flavor is the visual impact of their sleek, fat, glistening, silver-sided bodies packed end to end in their palm-sized, aluminum, pull-top can which neatly evokes the turn-key steel sardine cans of my childhood.  It's a picture almost too pure to sully with a fork or knife, luckily that ephemeral beauty remains up until the last body is pulled from the can and laid out upon its cracker and finally consumed with respectful appreciation.  Heaven."
1,"I adore sardines and have tried them all... at Trader Joe's (the worst! so dry and flavorless!), at Whole Foods, at local gourmet shops, imported from all parts of the world. These are succulent with the perfect, rich flavor. Even my baby (less than 1 yr old) loves to eat these (I wish I could give her more but they have added salt). If you want the best, these are the best. Don't even bother with the other King Oscar sardines."
1,"These sardines really stand out as the best national brand.  I like them because they are always found in perfect condition in the can, with their silvery skins sparkling, and heads and tails neatly trimmed away.  The flavor is delicate, lightly smokey and not too salty.  Though oilier than sardines packed in other sauces, rest assured that these contain pure olive oil and the natural fats of the fishes, which make them a good source of heart-healthy omega-3.  Drained of oil, they are roughly 150 calories per can.  The ingredients are simple:  Sardines, olive oil, and salt.<br /><br />How to eat them?<br /><br />Well, they are excellent right out of the can!  Most of the time, I decant them for draining and make an open-faced sandwich. They are very good on toasted Fisherman's Warf type sourdough bread, lightly spread with mayo, sweet pickle relish, and a dash or two of Tobasco.  The result is a nice midnight snack which never upsets the stomach.<br /><br />Finally, given the long shelf life, these cans of tiny fish would make a good addition to an emergency food supply.  At any given time, I've got a dozen or so (one case) stashed away, and I rotate them along with my other necessities."
1,The sardines came in about 3 days and are fantastic. I'll never buy any other kind. Tiny Tots are the best. Cross Packs are right up there too but hard to find.
1,"I've tried too many sardines to count and these are the very best you can buy. Don't waste time, energy and money on others unless you want to really appreciate how good these tender tasty Tiny Tots really are, as they marinade in that wonderfully thick extra virgin olive oil. I hope these things are in heaven if I manage to make it there. My second choice to these would be a beef tenderloin smoke grilled slowly over wood chipped charcoal."
1,These are still the best sardines in the market - can't find them locally in any stores - so get them by the case at Amazon.<br />These will make a sardine lover out of anyone!
0,"These are advertised as tiny sardines (tiny tots) but they are almost exactly the same size as the King Oscar double layer sardines in the red label. I have taken a photo of one of each can, opened next to each other. You can hardly tell the difference. Why should I pay so much more for sardines that aren't any smaller or different tasting? Very disappointing."
0,"I really didn't like these. They were mushy, not very flavorful and too oily. Tails left on a couple were kind of unpalatable. I found the Chicken of the Sea single layer smoked in soy oil to be firm and nice and smoky, albeit a tad salty. Better price too."
1,I found this to be a super value!  I wouldn't think of shopping anywhere else for my spices.  VERY happy customer!
1,"Couldn't find MSG anywhere.  It's more of a gag gift, but sweet baby it's MSG!!"
1,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035A11OQ"">Blue Buffalo Canned Dog Food, Beef Sirloin</a> is good stuff! We mix in a quarter of the can with some dry dog food (Blue Buffalo Adult Dog Dry Food, Chicken and Rice Recipe, 30-Pound Bag and our dog loves it. Because we get four meals out of a can, this is a pretty good value. The chicken flavored wet food is pretty good too."
1,Glad to say nice things about a healthy canned dog food my dogs actually enjoy (many of them are not to their taste.)  And Amazon makes it easy to obtain.  A great purchase.
1,"My dog is a ""no kill "" shelter rescue.  I tried every brand of holistic type canned and dry food, and he was totally uninterested.<br />He would only eat the least expensive canned food from the super market.<br />After reading revues I was informed to find it was the least nutritious available.  ""So your child likes candy, but you don't feed candy 3 times a day.""  These were the words that sent me to Blue Buffalo."
0,"I am not sure what has changed about this food, but my poor dog has been nothing but sick on this food, and she used to do well on it. I have noticed whenever I feed it to her, her stomach growls, she gets sick, and then she has uncontrollable diarrhea. I would not recommend it, get a better food. After I started looking around, it sounds like this food has caused a lot of illness and sometimes deaths in dogs."
1,This is great dog food.  My dog is very fussy about food and will usually only eat meat that I eat.  I had to find a high in nutrition dog food that was not full of fillers and corn meal etc.  This is the food your looking for.  It probably is the best on the market and my dog deserves only the best.  We humans wouldn't eat something that we didn't like and we are smart enough to know what is good for our bodies.  So we treat our pets the same.  We use to feed our pets Science Diet but have decided to upgrade to be a better dog food that he likes to eat.  I think it has much better flavor so my dog eats it.  Yes it is costs more but well worth the added 15 dollars per month cost.
1,"We keep telling Mom to quit trying other brands!  This is the tastiest canned food ever.  We feel sorry for the dogs whose owners only feed them grocery store dog food. signed, two happy terriers"
1,"I've left plenty of raving reviews for the different types of Blue canned food and I feel a little repetitive but for us and our dogs there really is no other brand that even compares! Between all four large German shepherds, Blue food and a raw diet are perfect for us! We have been nothing but pleased with this food so for us there is no other choice!"
0,"Although my dog(schnauzer) is a picky eater, she likes the Blue Buffalo dry food (lamb/rice and chicken/rice).  I have tried both the turkey dinner and beef dinner, and neither is very appealing to the dog.  I have been forced to give away the remaining cans I bought (not inexpensive) to others to see if dogs would eat them.  Not at all impressed with Blue Buffalo canned foods."
1,"My husband uses this on his popcorn, (along with chile powder, tomato powder, cayenne pepper, chili/garlic flavor flax seed oil and cumin). The effect is something like ""Chili Lime Tostios"". Pretty good stuff if I do say so myself. But we buy Twang only because we can no longer find his favorite at Whole Foods anymore [...]"
1,I love the product I recieved. I got hooked on Twang in Texas and now that I live in Florida-where they don't sell it anywhere- I will probably be buying it every couple of months. The package was secure and got here on exactly the day the invoice said I would recieve it. Great job!
1,I have been feeding this food for a few weeks now to my four dogs.  They are all doing very well on.  It is very palatable and highly digestible.  I would recommend this food.  It's definitely worth trying!
1,I have a 4 year old Boston Terrier who recently seemed to develop food allergies. I bought this food hoping it would help with her itching (which was in turn causing her to lose hair) and it really did help! She loved the stuff! I was dreading having to buy my dog 40 dollar bags of dog food. I love her to death but with a baby on the way I feel there are more important things to spend that money on but this dog food seems to have quality ingredients at a good price. The fact that it's American made was also something I really liked.
1,"I really hate to write a review in fear of Hi-Tek boosting their affordable prices on their dog food. My dog loves this food, no issues, and even has stinky firm stools to prove it. The ingredients are great; for what you buy and get in return is unmatched in my opinion. My dog has tried Hi-Tek's grain free, too, and she's very satisfied with that line as well. I'll be buying and recommending Hi-Tek for as long as their around."
1,My dogs (all four of them) love this food...even my 13-year old Pomeranian who gave up hard kibble a couple of years ago will munch at the bowl every now and again. Thank you for making a product that my dogs love and I feel good about feeding it to them :)
1,"My dogs enjoy this high quality food. Read about the ingredients, they are the best! No digestive problems, happy healthy dogs. A good price too."
1,"The product is great, but due to the price doubling, will not be purchasing anymore.  Very unfortunate situation.  My dogs did very well on this food."
1,This flavour is definitely a TOP favourite among the deployed troops. Never mind that there is no image available for this product. All the people who had a chance to savour this item have indicated that they would like more! Highly recommended.
1,"These are as expected from previously eating them. Great price when on sale.  Shipped fast, long shelf life. Good to keep in case of zombie apocalypse."
1,"Another good one from Maruchan!  These things are easy as heck to prepare, just microwave a cup of water to boiling and pour.  Five minutes later, you have a quickie lunch.  It's an American company with American workers, that's a bonus!"
1,"fast delivery,  cheap,  convenient<br /><br />ok so its the best tasting and contains a sht ton of salt,  but i still love it.  lol"
1,"I purchased two packages of these twist chews. They arrived quickly and were exactly what I wanted, but both packages had ants in them. After knocking off all (hopefully) the ants, I repacked the chews in plastic bags and stored them in the freezer to kill any critters I missed. The dogs ate them over time and had no bad effects, so I don't think the product was unsafe. It was just a creepy experience!"
1,I buy these bunnies every Easter for my husband and my father. They LOVE them. A bit expensive for chocolate but for once a year it's a nice splurge!
1,"The chocolate was as good as we expected.  Preferring darker nutrition dense and flavorfull foods, this met our expectations.  We will purchase other products from this company as we have need."
0,"Shame on me for not knowing what I was buying by not being sure how much the ounces were, but shame on the person for selling the bag of chips for that much money. I will never purchase anything from amazon again."
0,"A couple of months agoe I was looking for Dynasty Mustard Powder and had no luck locally, so I searched Amazon and found it. I was thrilled and ordered (the minimum order of 12) online. I gave away several bottles to neighbor's never noticing the expiration date. Last week I used my first bottle for a dressing I like and it tasted very bland but didn' know why. I tried remaking it a day agoe and again, bland. I decided to check all the dates on the ingrediantes and found the exp. date on the mustard is July 15,2011. I noticed on my last old bottle I had, it was 3 years to expiration (but there is only a teaspoon left). I was so upset that they would send me an item (12 bottles) that would be out of date in two months!"
1,"These pistachios are awesome.  They are delicious, naturally opened with minimal closed shells (almost none).  I'm very happy with this purchase and will reorder.  I recommend very highly!"
0,"I'd like to make it clear that I really like pistachios. I eat a lot of this particular nut but these Setton Farms pistachios were beyond bad. There was a large percentage of nuts which were hard as rocks. The nuts which I could actually bite into tasted rotten. Also there were more empty shells than in any purchase I have ever made. I decided to check the expiration date and found that the date is not printed on the bag, but instead is on a stick on label. I carefully peeled back the label and discovered parts of other labels beneath. Imagine that?! No wonder these were totally inedible. I returned them for a refund. If anyone has any suggestions for good quality pistachios, please let me know."
1,"We just finished off our first bag of Setton Farms Premium California Dry Roasted with Sea Salt Pistachios.  I really like pistachios and have had many other brands, but can tell you that these are really the best I have had. They were very easy to open, fresh, and had a wonderful, flavorful taste. I will most definitely buy them again."
1,"I received this bag broken, the pistachios were all over the box, I contacted amazon to return them to get a refund to then order them again, but since I left them open in our kitchen table my partner came and started eating them, by the time I noticed she had about a cup of them so I felt I couldn't return them. The box was in good condition so the damage was not in transit, I am not sure how the bag was so broken but the only explanation was that it happened while they packed them. On another note, my partmner didn't get sick from eating them but we didn't want to take a bigger chance. I do like this brand since I ordered the smaller bag before and that is why we decided to get the bigger one."
1,"These are nacho plain old pistachios--these are deluxe nuts. Not too salty, large, plump, and flavorful--they are simply the best."
1,"You've seen the commercials for a product and he just says ""Tasty"", well that is exactly what these pistachios are. And they are half the price that I can purchase from the local stores. Second time I have ordered and will be ordering more in the near future.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YLD7HE"">Setton Farms Premium Pistachios Roasted Salted - 1 Pound</a>"
1,"This sauce is for those who love high heat and flavor to their favorite dishes, so it's not intended for the casual hot sauce lover who is not acquainted with the strong spice just yet. The heat on this product is very high, even a small amount that will leave your mouth and tongue burning several seconds after consumption.<br /><br />Personally, I like this sauce and the heat lingers for a while and goes great on sandwiches, in chili, salsa and other things you want to add an intense kick to.<br /><br />Recommended for the hot sauce enthusiasts."
1,Have ordered from them before.... Nice company to work with and always friendly on the phone. They will even give discounts if you order more then one thing.
1,My kitty is very fussy and has UTI issues. This is a really good product for UTI issues and he actually likes it.
1,"My teen age daughters were disappointed not to be able to have oatmeal at the fast food place before school with their friends so we bought Eco-planet hot cereal packets for them to take along. It worked! They were really pleased with the flavor and the texture. It's hard to find where we live and the price is higher than I'd like to pay but it was safe, easy and good for them so I'll try to keep it in our kitchen for them."
0,These giant gummy bears are horrendous! They taste like ****! They smell just as bad! Note in the picture that the blue raspberry bear is GREEN! I only made it a couple of bites into my blue raspberry one. My husband thought it was awful too.
1,"Enjoyed, I bought using a kindle special offer and really became a fan of this tea. It brews a deep rich red, the mix reminds me of the English Christmas wassail but with more smoothness which comes from vanilla I think. Very nice for a cold and tastes wonderful esp. because their ingredients are so fresh."
1,I bought a package of these tasty little snacks to keep in my desk for when those pesky afternoon hunger pangs hit. It was supposed to keep me from buying the sugary crap in the vending machines. Little did i know that they would quickly become an addiction for the entire office - from the CEO to the receptionist. I am re-ordering 2 packs this time - 1 for them and 1 just for me!
0,"This product is NOT beef jerky or anything remotely like it. This product is neither spicy, nor beefy or meaty.<br /><br />What this product amounts to is a sour, salty, mushy, meat-based concoction pressed into stick form.<br /><br />And the ingredients*, to whom it may concern, are troubling to say the least.<br /><br />I'm currently inquiring in my social network about anyone with a dog who should like to have it. ('Who' may refer to the dog as well.)<br /><br />*Ingredients: Beef, Beef Hearts, Water, Soy Protein Concentrate, Salt, Dextrose, Spices, Corn Syrup, Smoke Flavoring, Paprika, Monosodium Glutamate, Flavoring, Sodium Erythorbate, Lactic Acid Starter Culture, Sodium Nitrite. (Appetizing, ahem.)"
0,"I have to say I am a beef jerky lover, I have tried many brands and makes of jerky and really have not found one I didn't like... until now. These beef sticks are not too spicy but have an odd taste to them, not sure what it is but one friend described is as a smokey twang. I have to agree, its an odd taste that is just not good, followed by a smokey cover up. I bought these to take to a boating party out at the lake because they looked like a good snack food, turned out I could not even give them away at the end of the day."
0,"i got these in the mail the other day and they are horrible. it is like they took Pink slime and seasoned it and piped it into thin plastic.<br />i am very disappointed :-(.  these are a step above a dog treat.  i hate to leave a negative review, but 30+ dollars with shipping. I brought this bag into work and put them in my Drivers room......they are still there. usually ANY food left on there table is gone. \<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FYVKRS/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
0,These are not very good. The taste is similar to slimjims but they're not as tasty. The texture is a little off too. A little mealy. If the taste was better or the texture was more appetizing they would have gotten a better review from me.
0,"I finally received my order of  buffalo bills  hot shot Hot flavor 2.1 lbs. I bought this because of all the review. My first thought about the taste of this beef stick is that it tasted really sour and i tasted some spices but it was far from hot,it wasn't even hot at all. Its easy to chew probably because it tasted too mushy and soft. The reason why i gave it a 2 star instead of 1 star is because it's was going for a good price. Overall, I wouldn't buy this beef stick because it taste mushy and sour, I'm sure it's not expired because  it says feb 2013. I knew i should've gotten the peperoni flavor beef sticks. Also, from all the other people's review i was expecting a sample from them since i read a lot of people received samples. I was kinda disappointed. So i won't be buying the hot shots again and its not because i didn't receieve a sample. haha"
1,These lil pepperoni sticks go quick for they taste great!  Bet ya can't eat just one!<br />Choo Choo R Snacks has the best customer service I have ever had the pleasure in dealing with also!
0,"thick skin has more substance than the mush inside; called pepperoni but who knows why; so maybe try cut up in soup as last chance, or just for the animals"
0,"I wanted to try these out because of the price and because it seemed to have solid reviews. I really like Slim Jims, and this looked similar and had good reviews.<br /><br />I didn't notice any mushiness that some people claimed. I thought it had a good snap to it, although you can definitely see where the casing is and the rest of the product, and sometimes it will just slide out a bit.<br /><br />I like the packaging. You can stick these into a big slider ziplock bag and it makes it far more convenient than any individually wrapped product, like Slim Jims are. I don't know how well it will keep that way, but I think it should be fine because, well, these products are pretty much designed to be kept like that. I don't know why some companies individually wrap theirs, maybe someone else can chime in on that.<br /><br />And now for the negative. Originally I tried to be more diplomatic with it, because I didn't want to dock stars for it not tasting like a Slim Jim. My brother absolutely hated the sticks and considers them disgusting. I held out that they weren't that bad, but after forcing myself to eat them the last few days I now give up.<br /><br />But worse is the ingredients. These things pack MSG. There is no nutritional label so we don't even know the percentage of it. But it is listed as an ingredient. Now it depends on you if that is a problem or not, for me personally I want to avoid MSG so this product doesn't work for me.<br /><br />I will likely throw away the rest of what I have. It is better to go for regular jerky, which can actually be healthy. These sticks are however a different product that you have to look at carefully, and for me the taste just isn't good enough to justify eating them."
1,"If you like the savory taste of beef hearts, you won't be disappointed by this product. Delicious beef heart flavor in every bite."
1,"Quality is sexexcellent, not excellent, but sexexcellent! Everything comes neatly packaged and they even give you free samples to try out. You can never go wrong. They are delish. As for these ""Short Shots"" they aren't really hot in my opinion, but they taste damn good and aren't 70% grease like Slim Jim (don't get me wrong, I love Slim Jim, but too greasy). You won't regret it, they are really, really good. This is my second time I've ordered and I've been more than satisfied with the quality."
1,"These are tasty, but I'm not thrilled with the MSG and corn syrup.  C'mon guys - nobody wants MSG in their food these days.  Drop that junk.  I knocked off 2 stars just for the lousy ingredients which may keep me from ordering these again.  But again, these are tasty.<br /><br />I'm adding a star to this review not for the product itself, but for the company selling them. When they saw the mediocre review, they immediately offered a refund or to try something else. You can't find better customer service."
0,"What they don't tell you: The first three ingredients are:  Beef, Beef Hearts, Water.  They also include Monosoldium glutamate (MSG) and corn syrup.  I wish I had known what was in these."
1,"Buffalo Bills Premium Snacks<br /><br />I realize that taste is an individual thing, but I thought I'd share my thoughts on these products.<br /><br />First, customer service is excellent.  I've always gotten exactly what I ordered in a very timely manner.<br /><br />So far I've ordered the following products:<br /><br />1) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Mild Short Shots<br /><br />2) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Hot Short Shots<br /><br />The first two short shots are very similar to Slim Jim's, just not individually wrapped, I just put them in a zip lock bag and find them very convenient to munch on( about a quarter pound per zip lock bag.<br /><br />3) Buffalo Bills 1.2lb Extra Smokeys<br />These are very smokey, but a little too dry for my taste.<br /><br />4) Buffalo Bills 16oz Premium Hickory Beef Jerky Pieces (random size<br />Taste great if you are a jerky lover.<br /><br />5) Buffalo Bills 2.1lb Pepperoni  Short Shots<br />Probably the closest to Slim Jim's of all the short shots<br /><br />6) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Honey Strung<br />O.K. taste.  My wife hates the smell.  My Brother doesn't care much for them either.<br /><br />All- in- all, I highly recommend these products (in the order listed) and this company.<br /><br />Gunner  January, 2010"
0,"I bought these on the strength of the reviews.  Inside the thin wrapper the texture was mushy, and I didn't like the taste at all.  It tastes mostly of beef heart, smoke and spices.  I found them inedible.  I had several of my friends try them since I didn't want to waste them if someone else could eat them.  The first two friends did not like them, but the third did, so they found a home.  The free sample of barbeque beef jerky was delicious, and I am going to order some of that.<br /><br />Addendum: Not long after I wrote the above review, I recieved a telephone call from the company.  He said that they stand behind all of their products, and even though I could not return the item since I had given them away, he would send me a replacement of any other jerky.  He sent me the barbeque jerky which I had sampled before. with two additional free samples of other flavors, which were also quite good.  I have never dealt with such a wonderful concern for their customers as I experienced with this company.  I think you can't go wrong buying from them.  He said if anyone doesnt like what they get, they will replace it."
1,"I was a little unsure when I ordered this. But it is great! Not very hot, but so tasty. They remind me of high quality slim jims, and they are way cheaper! And they don't have that crunchy gross skin stuff on them. Very good, i will order again!!!"
1,"Ever since the unfortunate accident at Conagra factory, the prices of slim jims have jumped to ludicrous prices. 49.99 for a 100 pack of slim jims! No sir, you have forced me to look elsewhere. I came across these little morsels when I was having my yearly slim jim itch and boy did they fill the spot. I think it would best describe these as slim jims without the massive amounts of grease and with a more satisfying spicy flavor. If you're still having trouble finding slim jims these are the perfect substitutes or even replacements."
1,"If you want a great tasting, non-greasy beef stick, choose Buffalo Bills short shots.<br /><br />But if you want an orange grease filled, life shortening, mystery meat stick, choose Slim Jims."
1,"Wow these short shots are AMAZING. Perfect spiciness and great size, texture and flavor. I couldn't stop eating these. Came with a free sample of the Habanero Jerky which was the best jerky i've ever had.<br /><br />These shipped quick and came sooner than expected.<br /><br />The only recommendation I could have for this product is to add a way to reseal the bag. These lasted me for a month and I just cut a little corner at the top of the bag. When I was done eating I rolled the bag up and it did keep it fresh, but a sort of seal would be nice.<br /><br />I will definitely order these again - great for Gameday or parties."

1,"Beef sticks have great flavor, without the greasy feeling. Not as spicy as I would like, but there is enough.  Great product to snack on."
1,"I bought these after having the craving being pregnant.  I searched for something that tasted like real meat but not greasy like slim jims and something I would feel good about eating and feeding to my 19 month old as well.  These are geat.  They're handy for on the go, very tasty and the paskage lasts a while.  Especialy considering I am pregnant and we pregnant women can go through some food!!!!"
1,"Who would have guessed that Beef, Beef Hearts, and water would be so good together (evidently Buffalo Bill's)"
1,I purchased these for my family to snack on and I haven't tasted flavor this good since I was a kid. It's worth every penny and you won't be unsatisfied. I found that we have purchased more of these and will be ordering more. This company has awesome products and stands behind their customers. Customer satisfaction is their number one priority.
1,My mouth feels warm and these are delicious!  I have never had anything this good for this type of snack!  I'm definitely going to order from them only!  I'm getting some of their jerky because their example is superb!  I can't wait to try more!
1,"I bought the Hot Short Shots because I was craving jerky and I wanted something inexpensive. I like really spicy food, so I should first agree with the other reviewers that these snacks will not light your mouth on fire, but there is a noticeable bite to them. But that doesn't stop them from being a thousand times tastier than a Slim Jim or even from regular, grocery store jerky. Plus, they are low calorie - just 25 cal per stick - so they make a great mid-day snack.<br /><br />But there's more to them than their deliciousness. When they arrived, they came well packaged, with a menu of other Choo Choo R products, and even some samples of their other great jerky. This is clearly a company that wants happy customers, and I am happy that my business is going to someone who deserves it.<br /><br />I will definitely be getting these on a regular basis now - I'm hooked!"
1,"Just received my first order today.  I purchased lots of different styles of this company's products and will review each one as I try them.  Well packaged and delivered, 2 packs had lost their vacuum.  Was given 2 different samples to try and will review those as well when I taste them.  I consider myself somewhat of an unofficial jerky connoisseur, even making my own jerky in the past.  I like the meat to shine through the taste, not sugar or salt.  A vegetarian I am not!<br /><br />Tasted my first pepperoni mild short shot today.  Upon the first bite I noticed it didn't have squishy fat oozing out of it like I remember these types of beef sticks having years ago when I ate them as a kid.  It had a mild pepperoni taste, not hot, not spicy.  Was that a slight hint of vinegar behind the nuance of flavor?  Had a nice, firm mouth-feel and a slight 'snap' around the edges when bitten into.  Wasn't hit with any sweet, and it certainly wasn't over salted.  Over-all, I rate this product high on the beef stick scale.  These weren't dried out, they were supple.  As a treat, I gave my dog a couple inches of it.  When his face came up to my hand and his nose hit the beef-stick, his eyes sort of rolled back in his head, Ha! To say the least, he loved it too!<br /><br />I have put all the packs of beef into my big freezer so they stay fresh and hold their integrity, since I bought over 150.00 worth (free shipping with 125.00 or more, at this time!)  I started a low carb diet and these are the perfect snack item to have on hand.  The beef is USA grown!  I would reorder these mild pepperoni short sticks again."
1,"Love,love.love this product. Will continue to buy this product for my hunters to take on their trips out."

1,"These little sticks have great flavor and are the right price for what you get.  The package was used for the superbowl party I had and everyone loved them, should of ordered two bags!"
1,"These tasty Pepperoni Short Shots are my favorite ""grab on the run"" treat. Small stick packed with big flavor."
1,"These little sticks have great flavor and are the right price for what you get.  The package was used for the superbowl party I had and everyone loved them, should of ordered two bags!"
1,Another great beef stick from Choo Choo - how do they pack so much wonderful flavor in those little sticks? The Hot Short Shots are the perfect treat with a zing anytime you need a quick snack. I love the 2.1 lbs package. I can keep plenty of beef sticks on hand for when the gang drops in to watch the game. Everyone loves the delicious beef taste of Short Shots and the hot ones are perfect with the cool beverages. Our friends would call it a foul if there was football without Hot Short Shots!
1,"THIS WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS NEEDING. GREAT PRICE, GREAT QUALITY, GREAT SERVICE!!!IT IS GREAT TO KNOW YOU CAN IMAGINE SOMETHING, FIIND IT, AND MAKE IT REAL!~!"
0,"After tasting a handful of this product, I threw the rest out!  I love beef jerky but this product is not even close!!"
1,"As a kid I loved to eat Slim Jims but gave them up as an adult because I can't tolerate the greasiness.  I wish I knew about Short Shots sooner because these things are a great replacement!  I originally bought the Mild flavor as a camping/hiking take along snack and it was well received by all of the adults, but none of the kids.  After our trip and running low, I bought the Pepperoni flavor which I found to be more peppery and much saltier than the Mild flavor.  While I prefer the Mild, my husband and older daughter prefer the Pepperoni.  Next flavor we will try is the hot.  The texture is drier and chewier than Slim Jims, but I think the quality is better also.  I realize some people have a problem with beef heart as ingredient, but muscle is muscle (and this is probably in Slim Jims too)."
0,"Before purchasing this product, I read the reviews.  Most were very positive which ultimately convinced me to make the purchase.  Unfortunately, the only real way to know if you would like a product such as this is to taste it.  After doing so, I was very disappointed.  I found the flavor to be absent except for all of the salt.  It's labeled ""hot"", however, I didn't detect any spicy heat whatsoever.  The texture was stringy and chewy.  After chewing on them, the Short Shots wind up as a balled up mass which you either decide to swallow or spit out.  Overall, I did not like the product one bit and rated it with one star."
1,"I read the reviews of these Short Shots & they get compared to Slim Jims a lot.  They are not anything like Slim Jims!  These are small, moist & most of all tasty little sticks of beef.  When you finish eating 1/2 a dozen (if you can stop there) of these, your fingers & mouth are not bathed in that orange grease that Slim Jims leave you with.  One bag of the Short Shots is almost 1/2 the cost of Slim Jims.  What gives there?  On the ""Bang For The Buck"" Scale, this product receives a 9+.  Only because a 10 is perfect & everybody knows that nothing is perfect nowadays.  Now I know I've said enough because I've just finished the 8th stick while typing this review!  Enjoy them, they're addicting!!!!"
1,"I have memories of when my father used to bring us slim jims and we just loved them. As an adult I do not like the taste any longer of most slim jim products. I think these taste much better and the 2.1 lb bag goes a long way. I use food saver to put them in smaller packages. I have ordered several bags of these over the years and enjoy them as a quick snack. These are labeled HOT but to me are not that hot. Hope this review helps, pick up a bag I am sure you will enjoy them.<br /><br />Cheers."
1,I buy this occasionally for work so the guys and me can have a snack for a few days. Tastes very simular to a Slim Jim but in my opinion a bit better. Best Jerky bang for your buck so you can't go wrong with it.
1,"I wrote a negative review about Buffalo Bill's Hickory Beef Jerky, but I really enjoyed these mild beef sticks.  They have a lemony sourness that I found very appealing, and they were the perfect snack during long hikes.  I will order them again."
1,"I have ordered the Hot Short Shots many times in the past, and they are usually of excellent quality. My family loves them, as well as our two pups. However, this last order was not as good. Some of them were very tough and were collapsed and wrinkled on the outside. The taste seemed a little off, and I thought it was my imagination so I didn't say anything, but when my husband tasted his first one, he noticed right away. I am hoping that this is just an off batch, because this is one of our favorite snacks and I don't know of any other snack sticks that have the distinctive flavor and texture that these have. I will cross my fingers and order again!"
1,I have eaten alot of meat snacks over the past 60 years and I have to tell you these are some of the best.  They are not the cheapest but they sure are the tastiness.  Well worth the price and the 2 lbs actually lasts a long time.
1,"Like other customers I divide these into handfuls in ziplock bags.  They keep well and are not messy at all to eat (good for kids).  Great for road trips, camping and hiking, or just snacking."
0,"I've had several brands of beef sticks and am not a very picky eater, so was surprised that there was a pretty big discrepancy between how this product was reviewed here and how it tasted. To me it tasted more like beef heart than beef (and I have actually sampled beef heart before, so I know what it tastes like! Not something I would buy); the skin provided some resistance but then it was very mushy on the inside. Maybe my batch had a higher proportion of that than normal? I got the hot flavor, but that did not mask the weirdness of the taste.<br /><br />The reason for two stars instead of one: I brought it with us while we were camping, and we were a little short on food. The short sticks provided sustenance even if we all grumbled a little bit about the taste. They didn't cause any diarrhea or stomach problems.<br /><br />Unlike other people I did not receive any samples from Buffalo Bills and so have no input with regards to how their other stuff tastes."
1,"These things are MUCH, MUCH better than Slim Jims.  These are exactly what I was looking for.  They are not all oily and greasy like other beef sticks.  I could probably eat the whole pack in a day! LOL!"
1,"I always worry about these other brands, but you will be pleased with this brand if you normally like Slim Jim.  These are not as greasy but have all the same great taste.  You will not be upset you bought them."
1,I bought these for my annual backpacking trip i go on with my cousin and friends and they were fantastic.. Good enough that im buying them again this year.
0,"I ordered the mild sticks about 1 month ago an loved them. They were better than slim Jim's. Better flavor, less greasy. So I was running out and ordered more MILD sticks. I got the hot ones. These lack the snap of the mild so are less satisfying. The spice was nice, but still I want my mild sticks."
1,"I've bought Slim Jim and Jack Links X-Sticks quite a few times, so figured I'd give these a try. I purchased these based on the reviews, and they taste absolutely awful. I choose to go with the ""Mild"" flavor, and there is no mild flavor to it. Just extremely salty and some sour taste as well. I don't write reviews often, but considering how high the ratings are and how bad the product I received was, I figured I should share my experience.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Update. The seller happened to email me and sent me a ""free sample pack"" of beef jerk products after I wrote my initial review. The strange thing is that sample pack included a pack of ""Beef Sticks (didn't say mild, hot, or anything on it). These beef sticks look just like the mild beef sticks I got from Amazon. However, they actually taste good, slightly less salty, and have the mild flavoring. This leads me to believe that there was something wrong with the ones from Amazon, and that these do taste quite good as long as you get a good batch."
1,"These are better than slim jim. the only reason i gave them four stars is because of the price. If you put them in snack bags then in the fridge, they make a great portable warm weather snack."
1,I obviously like those beef sticks because i ordered it again! thanks for the samples on the first order. I am deployed so those sticks makes for a good snack. thanks for the quick shipping! I will be ordering more!<br /><br />Mahalo
1,The item is really good. I just had to wait 10 days to recive the item. so I probably won't order again.
1,Package arrived within 4 days of purchase. I LOVE the taste simply amazing.  My only complaint is I can't afford to buy 100 pounds of this stuff.
0,"These are not really that good. They have like twenty or so ingredients but none add anything close to flavor. imo buy something else, also its 2 lb's so once bag is open have to store it in something else unless you eat it all at once and that would be unlikely with the before mentioned taste."
1,"I have the hot spicy kind. I'm not very big on greasy foods, so these beef sticks with a little bit of flare to em do it for me. :) I've only had a couple so far, so I can't describe the flavor to well, not a hot hot spicy or anything though, more like a mild with a flare."
1,For the value and for the diet this is an amazing snack! Just ordering the mild and another hot. Fast shipping with prime and will be a repeat customer! Better than a slim jim and quality is cleaner :)
1,"My daughter loves mild Slim Jim's so I decided to give these a try. As far as I'm concerned they taste very similar, but seem much less greasy to me.  THese end up being a better value than buying regular Slim Jim's and so I've got no complaints."
1,"Only tried Hot.<br /><br />Amazon $25 on 02/12/2012.<br /><br />Pro<br />Value for weight & price<br />Tasty.<br />Nice Texture.<br />Outside Snappy.<br />All Beef.<br /><br />Cons<br />Hot is kind of mild, takes about 3 sticks before I feel it mildly.<br /><br />Would be nice if individually wrapped but Zip Lock Bags work just fine for portability."
1,"I liked them, i liked the taste alot, the inside was a bit to mushy though, not enough of a meaty feeling to it."
1,"They taste great, its the only way my and my shop can get fresh jerky out here in Afghanistan. Recieved the package promptly for my area and everything was fresh and un-damaged."
0,The delivery was quick and the package arrived without issue. The reason for the 2 stars is because i wasnt satisfied with the Flavor . I just dont have a taste for it. so now i have 2 pounds of meat sticks that im not going to eat. the company did send a sample of its barbecue beef jerky which was really nice. next time i will have to order that. you win some and you lose some. it happens.
1,I buy these for a snack for the guys at work and everyone loves them. They taste great and keep for a long time - not usually a problem when people grab them by the handful. I suggest buying these and the Hot; both packs last the 6 of us about 10 days. These are also a great side item for school lunches.
1,"These are way better then Slim Jims. Less greasy and more flavor. The Mild Short Shot's are just a really good product, nice smokey flavor, no pockets of grease like a slim jim and very consistent. Fast shipping as always."
1,"Purchased the mild shorts:<br />Gladly surprised when I opened the package up. They didn't feel or taste ""greasy"" in the least (think Slim Jims).<br />All in all, I think they were fantastic and the price point was pretty solid.<br />I will be purchasing again later."
1,"When I saw the product on Amazon, I did'nt know the size of the package. 2.1# is a lot of meat. Ordered it on March 14th, got it on march 16th. Good beef sticks, and the sample pack of beef jerky was delishish!!!"
1,I've eaten about 1/3 of them and now they just make me feel sick.<br />They taste good and I love the pop when you break the casing biting into the sticks.<br />I'm going to have to re-seal the rest though. No way I can go through 2 lbs of that before they start going bad. :\
0,"While the cost on this item is sure to bring attention, I found the taste to be a little bland while the product was dryer then I am used to with jerky of this type. Please note this is for the ""Hot"" version of this product (there are three flavors and I have not tried the other two so your millage may very on the other flavors) Shipment was fast and packaging was A1. Perhaps I'll give the other flavors a try."
1,"These are realy great.  They have a nice tangy smoke flavor, that goes great with the heat.  They're also alot less salty then other beef sticks I've had.  I guess they use the smoke to perserve them.  Instead of using lots of salt.<br /><br />The heat is not super intense.  It might be to much if you are sensitive to heat, but in that case.  Buffalo Bills has a mild version."
1,I was extremely happy with this item.I received it in a speedy fashion and it was exactly what i was expecting.
1,"i got a factory 2nds bag of these, so a bit disappointed.<br /><br />though the price is right, and the flavor, texture, and moisture in these are great.  you like beef sticks?  these are great."
1,"I bought these as a birthday gift for my jerky-loving husband and was he ever happy. He thought they were great and we intend to order many more products from this company.<br />They are salty, and a bit greasy with a mix of chewy crunchy outer and a chewy inner. The first bite is a tad spicy but after that its fine. You defiantly can't stop at just one! My husband made me hide them from him because he quickly polished off about 8 of them and he wanted to make them last!<br />Also, our order was received three days ahead of the estimated time to ship them so that was a big plus.<br />My hubby was thrilled because the company also threw in a free sample pack of honey pepper jerky as a thanks ( the price of which covered the shipping and handling charge, so I feel like I got a good deal).<br />Completely pleased with this product!"
1,"I enjoyed them as soon as I opened box!  I also purchased the HOT short beef shots They are incredible and leave a wonderful HOT warmth to your mouth.  These are so much better than Oberto and I went to school with those guys, they were friends of our family. They have good, but this is better than that in my mind! Excellent sticks not bland and icky, they are GREAT!"
1,"De verdad los productos de esta marca son excelentes, pero a pesar de ser de carne tienen una textura un poco grasosa y un sabor acido, prefiero las Slim Jim.<br /><br />this brand is excellent, but the taste is sour and the texture is a little greasy, i prefer the slim jim."
1,"I had never purchased Beef Jerky or Beef Sticks through an on line vendor, prior to placing an order with Choo Choo R. Snacks. The products arrived on time and in good shape.  They were great. The peperoni sticks lasted about 4 days.  The big bag of jerky, about 6.  I had heard several customers complain about the jerky being tough.  When I was growing up, some 50 yearsw ago, jerked meat WAS TOUGH, chewy, but tough.  Bufflo Bills' Hickory smoked jerky was delicious.  They sent along a packof Teriaki (SP), flavored jerky.  Wow, that was soooo good!  I have placed another order with Choo Choo R Snacks.  I will buy all my Jerky, Beef Sticks, etc from Choo Choo.  They do these products right!"
1,"I've been ordering these for the past year or so. They make amazing snacks for camping trips and they're fun to share with people (until they come back asking for 2nds... and 3rds...). Yeah, they're that good. As some others have said, imagine a Slim Jim, but without all of the grease that soaks out everywhere. It's true that it doesn't have that 'authentic' pepperoni taste, but in my opinion it's more than good enough. Not only that, but the people at Choo Choo snacks are generous enough to add in a sampler for some of their other products in every order. Their jerky samples taste incredible, but I'm more of a beef stick person. I like the snap that they make when you bite into them. Buffalo Bills short shots are more than worth the asking price. If you've never tried them before, don't be afraid. If you're a fan of meat snacks, you'll like these without a doubt. Hell, I bet you could even get some vegetarians to convert just from the scent. :D"
1,"I was real excited to get these and I was personally disappointed with the heavy beef heart texture and gently flaking casing. My friends though swear they're better than slim jims as they are much less greasy. They didn't taste bad to me, they were just not my thing. ChooChoo was awesome as usual with fast shipping. Try em, they're cheap enough and everyone else loves em."
1,"These taste better than Slim Jims, have better texture and aren't as greasy.  The package is much bigger than it looks in the picture.  They aren't individually wrapped, so I put them in small zip lock bags in the freezer.  These are pretty good, but I like the Tillamook beef sticks better.  It's a good value considering how many you get."
1,"Great Taste, not greasey whatsoever like Slim Jims.  Extremely addictive, I would take 10-12 to work and they would be gone by 1030.<br /><br />Will definitely buy again!"
0,"The taste was somewhat greasy.  Hoped for a product better than ""Slim Jims"" but they are not. They responded to my criticisms and are sending me a sample of another product they feel I might like better."
1,Choo Choo snacks is unusual in their customer service in that they are very supportive of customer feedback.  This attention to the customer makes them a company worth doing business with
1,"These are good little beef sticks.  I bought the mild, but I wonder if I'd enjoy a more spicy one.  The flavor isn't the best for this sort of thing, but it's far from the worst and is quite good.  Just not quite up to a ""five star"" rating for me.  Still, I can't complain and I'd order products from these people again, just try a different flavor or product maybe next time.<br /><br />As an aside, they also sent a sampler size pack of their ""country cut"" beef jerky in Teriyaki flavor, and that I found to be excellent.  The next thing I buy from them might be the beef jerky instead, just based on the small sample package I found that much closer to a five star product.<br /><br />I did a seperate review for the seller proper, but in brief I'd call their shipping five star, very fast and well packaged.  Just for the record without making a comment pro or con about whom they used to ship, they used US Mail."
1,"First off, the products from choochoorsnacks are as good as there shipping and customer service. I have not had any problems with these short shots other than having to hide them from scavengers. Guess that means i'm not the only one who enjoys these things. these things are quite mild and i will be trying the hotter ones eventually. Much better than slim jims or any other kind of beef straws out there. If these sticks sound good to you then chances are you'll be happy with this purchase."
1,These mild beef sticks are awaesome....they taste great and much better than Slim Jim's.  I'm a beef stick fanatic and this is one of the better beef sticks that I have tasted.  Not oily or greasy at all.
1,"I like the slender, easy to pack, snack, toss around<br />feel of these little fellas.<br /><br />Bought em twice now, and will likely buy them again."
1,"These were just what I was looking for. They remind me a bit of a SlimJim but much higher quality and not suspended in whatever strange greasy/watery residue a SlimJim is. They had just a touch of heat to give them flavor, but very mild. I threw a couple in sack lunches for a few weeks and they were a real treat."
1,"Better than any Beef Jerkey that I've ever purchased from the store, and Slim Jim's are no comparison to this brand either."
1,These beef sticks are a great snack.  Perfect sized sticks.  Great for camping and also goes good with beer.
1,"These taste pretty good and they're not greasy.  Not too hot, not too mild."
1,"I've been trying unsuccessfully to find this flavor.  I've bought out all the A&W cream sode jellies in the Target and Cub Foods stores in my surrounding metropolitan areas.  They never replenished this flavor.  So, I just thought I'd try googling them - was I excited to find amazon carries them - I'll be ordering shortly!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"This is some of the best tea! Great flavor and great benefits too! A little bit goes a long way, so it lasts forever."
1,"If you have a chance to visit the Tao of Tea shop at 3430 SE Belmont Street in Portland, Oregon, you'll find a unique place with a unique approach to tea. Fine tea there is not chopped beyond recognition. Think of a salad bar of various teas, all nicely dried, of course, displaying a range of colors and shapes that cry out to be sampled. Tea is, of course, a matter of taste. I especially like the Kukicha, which includes tea leaf stems that provide a richer, darker taste that I crave. Getting it from amazon.com is much easier for me, since I live in Southern California, and cheaper than at the local store that carries it."
1,"These taste awesome and until you taste it yourself you won't know what your missing.  They are my crack, I can't stop at just one.  They lie somewhere between a candy bar and a biscuit.  I am so glad I found a place to purchase these in the U.S. :}  The closest thing I could compare them to stateside would be if you replaced the peanut butter in a Little Debbie's Nutty Bar with caramel.  So much better though!"
1,"I have generally purchased loose teas at one of the brick and mortar specialty stores.  I took a chance on this selection as I've enjoyed Boston Tea's bagged selections in the past.  They did not disappoint.<br /><br />If you like fruit flavored, black tea this is a KEEPER; mild, yet fruity and flavorful with just enough ginger to tantalize.  Black tea can be strong and sometimes bitter if brewed incorrectly.  However, this tea hasn't been bitter through my first whole pound!  The black tea has never overpowered the subtle added flavorings and vice versa; an absolutely perfect blending for an absolutely satisfying cuppa either on its own or with a little something.  I suggest a little sweetener of your choice and you're ready to sit back for that ""Ahhh!"" moment.<br /><br />HIGHLY recommend."
1,This brews a wonderful pot of tea that's great hot and also delicious cold. The ginger adds just a hint of zing to a slightly sweet black tea. I've been drinking a lot of it!
1,I love this tea...steeping it every morning has become almost a ritual. I first tried it on a whim...what a great choice (and surprise).
1,"I like this tea, I bought it as a replacement for another brand of Peach and sweet ginger tea that came in teabag form. This is just as good and the price works better this way."
1,"Got my tea today and LOVE it. The smell is awesome right out of the bag, but the brewed tea is even better. Definitely pleased with this purchase."
1,This is a very good tea for aficionados and for me only Taiwan Spring Tea is better. Sure will not last long.
1,"This is my most favorite tea.  My most excellent Sis got it for me several years ago, and now, since I asked for it, I got it again.  It is very pretty.  It smells wonderful, just like it tastes (fruity and spicy)  I have not checked it yet, but suspect that it is very good for you also.  After I have checked that out, I will update this.<br /><br />I guess it is very good for you.  If you are a health nut, add buckwheat honey (antioxidants) and lemon (helps get more of the good stuff into your system)"
1,Land O Lakes Hot Chocolate is by far the best tasting instant cocoa mix I've ever tried - and I've tried alot of them. It's creamy without being off the scale in calories and fat; little high on the sugar but that's probably why it tastes so good. Highly recommend this product!
0,Used to be made in america now there soggy not chewy and made in mexico!No wonder the price has dropped at the local store $2.59 for this box.
1,"One of the troops I support, who is currently in Iraq, is from Louisiana, and he was craving Louisiana Original Hot Sauce.  He made a bet with another friend that we couldn't get it to him...I proved him wrong...and he was delighted.  Louisiana Hot Sauce gave this soldier a taste of home, and he definately gave it 5-stars for giving the pretty bland food served in Iraq a ""taste of home""."
1,"I used to eat these licorice ropes as a kid all the time, I am 39 years old and still enjoy them whenever I can find them.  I am now buing them for my three sons too.  The BEST!"
0,"I was very disappointed in the ropes. They were tough to eat. If I put them in the microwave for 10 seconds, they were pretty good. I did get a response from the seller, and they said that they were in a warehouse, and due to the cold weather, they were firmer. The ropes were within their expiration --or shelf life date. I probably will not order them again."
0,The licorice was stale and many of the wrappers were split.<br /><br />I would not buy from them again.
1,"BR is a great soda found in mainly the southern US, and is a very popular drink in Texas.<br /><br /> The flavor is quite hard to describe, some say bubblegum, others say vanilla, others say cherry. But it tastes great!<br /><br /> Another thing you can make is a Big Red Float. Just pour a glass of Big red into a glass, put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on it and VIOLA! A great treat!<br /><br /> Try this pop out! It also comes in a new flavor, Big Red Vannila Float. BR with a hint of vanilla!"
1,"Big Red - the unofficial soda of Texas is excellent.  It's hard to pinpoint the exact taste; some say bubble gum, while others compare it to cherry.  Regardless, you should definitely give this a try.  Best tasted cold - you won't regret.  I only wish it was distributed in New England."
1,"This is the soda I grew up on, that and Dr Pepper. Has a great taste and nothing says Texas better than Big Red. Instead of Root Beer Floats, we had Big Red Floats, ten times better! Just have a sip of it and it will take you back to when you were a kid with no cares in the world."
1,This is a very good soft drink.  Smooth strawberry cream soda.  Very tasty!
1,"THIS is the ONLY POP, period. Awesome Vanilla Floats. Once again, necter of the Gods."
1,i moved from the midwest to california and can't find it anywhere i use to be able to just walk around the corner to the liqure store or gas station and get a bottle or two but now wish i could find it around her I LOVE THIS STUFF!
1,Big Red Soda is hard to find in the Northeast - thankyou for providing us with fast service and shipping!
1,this is a TX fav.  but not living there anymore.  decided that i needed a taste of home and found it right here.  drink up!!!!
1,"I'm a big fan of this soda. There is a local restaurant that sells it (Texas BBQ style) and it is so good! Bright red, tastes like vanilla with a very light cherry taste. I see others describe it as bubblegum taste but I don't think it tastes like bubblegum. Its more like vanilla cream with just a hint of fruit. This drink is a must taste! Too bad we can't get it here in California grocery stores! Awesome!"
1,I love this soda.  I wish I could find a store where I live that sells it.
0,Well I had to try it based on the rave reviews. Glad I only purchased 12 cans ... I just don't like this stuff at all(can't give them away fast enough)... Tastes like carbonated perfume to me. If you want a REALLY DELICIOUS creme soda try Hansens Cherry Vanilla Creme. Now THAT is a GREAT creme soda
1,We have grandchildren born in Nebraska but have moved.  We had a case sent to the twins on their 11th birthdays!!  I mean GO BIG RED soda is a perfect gift from very proud Nebraska grandparents.  Already they are asking for more!!
1,"It was quite a thrill for me to suddenly find cartons of Big Red sitting on the shelves of a local mega-large retailer a few months ago.  I had never heard of Big Red until one of my college roommates brought some to school with him (and that has been some years ago).  At the time, I found the bubble gum taste interesting, but I didn't get a large enough sample of it to really know whether I liked it or not.  Then, several years later, some Big Red magically appeared in a local convenience store, and that is when I grew to love it.  Alas, the stuff soon disappeared off of this store's refrigerated shelves, leaving me to wonder if I would ever enjoy this unique soda drink again.  This may be a Southern product dating all the way back to 1937, but few folks here in North Carolina have ever heard of the stuff.  Maybe that will begin to change now - as long as the Big W keeps it on the shelves.  Some folks are bound to try it, if for no other reason than the price, which is significantly cheaper than all of the well-known colas.  In my opinion, the carton and bottle designs (as well as the price) actually make this look like a knock-off, discount product.  We all know how nasty those knock-off colas taste, so don't let yourself be fooled into thinking that Big Red isn't worth a try.  This stuff is all kinds of good.  It is reportedly available in 43 states now, so keep an eye out for it - or just order some from this site.<br /><br />There is one issue you need to be aware of, though.  Big Red will turn your mouth red.  That includes the lips, so guys who drink this stuff should probably take a look at themselves in the mirror before heading out for a night on the town with their buddies - unless you want to take the chance of a lipstick joke or two thrown your way.  If I drink it at night, I have to wash off my lips inside and out to avoid waking up to a pillow sporting various red stains the next morning.  It's a small price to pay, though, for something that tastes as good as Big Red."
1,If you have never drank a Big Red before you need to have one immediatly. These are delicious sips of heaven.
1,"I love red cream soda... not the plain cream soda.  Red Cream soda can be hard to find so I went looking online and found this - and tried it a few times.  I love it!!  Its worth the extra cost in shipping.  I tried the diet big red too and loved it (and I'm not a diet drink fan).  Also, some red cream sodas are too ""syrupy"" or too sweet...this Big Red is just right."
1,"Back when I was a child my parents used to buy this for us while we were camping.  For years I didn't see a drop of it, but it was always there at the back of my mind.  Recently I've found that they've started stocking it in a near-by gas station.  Its a bit more expensive there, but definitely worth it.<br /><br />The GREATEST soda I've ever come across."
1,"BIG RED<br /><br />This is one of my all time favorite drinks of all time and to be honest when it comes to cokes, soda, pop or what ever you want to call it I doubt there is much out there that can top this. I was born in Texas and once again as off 5 or 6 years ago I made way back here and could not have been happier to have this drink at my disposal once again. For many many years while living on the East Coast namely Maryland were this drink is not available all I could do was bring some back with me after visits to family back in the Lone Star State.<br /><br />If you want to be specific this is a cream soda, a red cream soda to be exact. But to all those saying I am not a fan of cream soda I assure you that red cream soda has a much different taste as compared to just cream soda. This wonderful drink that comes out of Waco Texas is really one of the most refreshing soft drinks I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. For all you calorie nuts out there this does have 150 worth per can of it but if you watch your intake this could be a wonderful luxury drink as my grandmother says about the Vanilla Float version of Big Red.<br /><br />If you ever come across this drink any were or order drinks from the net I highly recommend it, even if you only drink these type of drinks every so often you should at least try it. My best friend from Maryland came with me to Texas a couple of times and after trying this drink he is hooked. It is important for you to know that the guy is a mixed martial artist and does not really drink soft drinks; this would be his luxury drink."
0,"I got this gardenia bonsai in mid-February and it is not as I expected. Upon opening the package, the leaves are dull green, no buds, dried out and mostly dark brown. I followed the instruction and even did some research work through the internet. I even bought extra stuffs like plant food, cool mist humidifier just to revive the plant. Well now, after 3 weeks, 90% of the leaves are gone, branches bare, looks like those bare trees that you see during winter. I tried to contact the merchant and ask for advise, but I did not get any response. I have other bonsais and regular gardenias that are healthy and I really wanted this gardenia bonsai so bad."
0,I'm always hesitant to write a negative review because tastes are different but with this product I felt I had a duty to alert consumers.  I bought this and out of the box it was pretty until I looked close and found it was infested with tiny white bugs that clung to nearly every branch and leaf.  I hoped they would die on their own but after three weeks they were still there and the plant itself had started to die.  I bought plant insect spray and they killed the bugs.  The plant died two weeks later.  I was very disappointed since I'd always wanted a bonsai tree and gardenia is my favorite scent.
0,"I ordered this plant and I can't even beleive you're allowed to lie like this and get away with it. The item description clearly states that the plant is supposed to be a 4yr old that is 8 inches high and in a 10 inch pot. This is not my plant at all, its about 6 inches if that and in a 6.5 inch pot. I can't beleive I paid $32 for this plant. There is no one to get in contact with to return it or ask WHAT IS GOING ON?!?! I don't understand why you say you will give a plant that is completely different from what I received. I am very unsatisfied with my plant and even more with your bad service, no one anwsers my emails or questions. If anyone can help me, my email is chanteldionne@hotmail.com"
0,"Not sure if the plant is going to survive, The pot was broken when we opened the box yet the shipping box showed no signs of damage. I can't find out how to return it either since it is a plant - these independent Amazon merchants make returns difficult : (  So much for this present."
1,"The bonsai was packed well and looked great out of the box.  It shed a lot of leaves about a week after arriving, giving us a scare, but new leaves are now sprouting out all over the place.  It's healthy and growing."
0,"Positive: Gardenia Bonsai arrived in good shape and packaged well.<br /><br />Negative: Did not look like a Bonsai at all, they advertise they are suppose to be 4 yrs old?? Mine looked like a normal Gardenia bush that was pruned way back and stuck in a small pot. I plan on returning it, my wife was disappointed because it was a christmas gift for her!"
0,"I ordered this bonsai tree for my daughter-in-law because she listed it on her Amazon wish list as ""highest"" for this Christmas 2005.  The order came in record time, three weeks before Christmas so I set about babying the tree each day by following all of the directions to a tee!  I sprayed it and watered it  exactly as the directions stated and I placed it in a sunny well lighted area and the temperature in our condo was never below 65 degrees and that was only at night while we slept. Nonetheless, after two weeks, still a week before Christmas, the leaves began to curl, turn splotchy and fall off. I was very sad about this because the tree had looked wonderful when it arrived and it was very well packed.  But, by the time Christmas Eve arrived it had only about half of its original leaves.  We are now waiting to see if the tree does better at my daughter-in-law's home since she is very happy to have it and she'd love to keep it...she is going to try to nurture it into a healthy life.  We'll see...  M. Buchanan"
1,"I reviewed some of the comments from others about broken branches, and dead leaves.  I was very worried what I would get but my tree arrived in one piece no broken branches and beautiful.  I love the bonsai I have only had it about 2 weeks and already I have a ton of buds on it which should be blooming in the next week.  This was a great buy for the price!!"
1,"I was a bit worried from some of the reviews I read here on Amazon, but this Bonsai arrived as pictured(minus the flowers, not in blooming season)  I even used Amazon's free supersaver shipping.  We have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good.  Very good value from Brussel's."
1,"I've been looking for a reasonably priced Gardenia Indoor Bonsai Tree for a long time. I knew Amazon would be the place to buy.<br />I've read all the reviews and searched all the items available here. Although there are some bad reviews about this item, i still decided to give it a try.<br />and I am so glad that I did!<br /><br />I have used a 2 days shipping just to make sure the plant won't be stuck in the box for too long. It arrived on time.<br /><br />The package is really well packed. the soil is nice and moisture when it is arrived, as the pot part was wrapped carefully in a plastic bag. ALL the leaves are green! This is much better than i have expected. I thought couple yellow and dropping leaves were understandable as it has been moved around. But i guess they have exceeded my expectation. No single dropping leaf or yellow leaf at all.<br /><br />I saw 2 flowers already, and it smells fantastic and gorgeous!<br /><br />I am completely satisfied with the order."
1,"So i ordered this gardenia and its gorgeous. Ive had it now for a couple of weeks and i leave it in my window. The sun form this is enough to feed it , along with some water everyday. Very healthy plant and a very healthy idea. Great guy to buy from....call Lou."
1,"Plant ordered 12/12/2011 Like the others I was very skeptical ordering this plant due to there being many negative reviews, but my mom loves gardenias so I decided to give this a try anyways for christmas. I used 2 day shipping and as ordered the plant arrived in 2 days exactly. Opening the box I was ready for the worst but to my surprise i opened the top and all I could see was tons of little green leaves!! This plant is seriously amazing about 6-8 inches tall and looks like its ready to flower with tons of branches and leaves. The packaging job was amazing all the soil was still together, no broken branches and came with a how to care booklet. I am 100% satisfied with this order!<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: If you are going to order dont be cheap and spend the extra $15 on 2 day shipping. I believe that really makes a difference in the condition your plant will arrive in. if you pay for regular ground shipping your plant is going to sit in a box for 1-2 weeks can you really expect it to show up in healthy condition?"
0,"The bonsai plant itself looked like it could have been beautiful.  Unfortunately, when it was shipped to South Dakota around Christmastime, the state was experiencing extremely cold temperatures.  Only packing peanuts were used for insulation, and the plant died.  Restrictions should be placed on shipping these type of products to cold climates or packing material that provides better insulation should be used."
1,I am very pleased with my order.  The trees were packed very carefully and arrived in excellent condition.  It seems to me that these people really care about bonsai and will have my business in the future.
0,"Not too thrilled with this one though.  Seems to not have any growth and getting yellower by the day.  I'm not sure it survived shipping very well.  It was moist when we got it, but there was only one bloom left on it which dropped after one week.  I didn't care for it any differently than the Jade, which sits right next to it on the counter.  The only thing it seems to attract is bugs.  We finally had to put it outside because it was getting pretty bad.  I think its still alive, but not sure how much longer it has."
1,"My Gardenia Bonsai Tree arrived today, and she's in terrific condition, complete with a bloom and at least two more, on the way! There are no yellowing or brown leaves and the soil, upon arrival, was very moist to the touch! The bonsai pot is nice and large and mine's a gorgeous color blue. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this fragrant, beautiful and well grown bonsai, to any bonsai lover and makes a terrific gift! Ships quickly and packed very safely."
1,"I'm skeptical of the ""helpful"" reviews here with such low marks. I purchased this plant as a Mother's Day gift and my mom has had nothing but success with it. They aren't supposed to flower for a year or two after you get them (due to the adjustments they need to the climate and your particular (bad?) watering habits), but she got the plant to flower twice in one year. I think a key to this was keeping it outside during our nice, sunny Minnesota days, and then bringing it inside again each and every night. Adding the correct fertilizer in the correct amount is important.<br /><br />Bonsai aren't necessarily easy, but this one has done well. That's my experience anyway.<br /><br />Also, I was impressed with the packaging - securely shipped and eco-friendly. And the flowers smell absolutely wonderful!"
0,"So it came with beautiful greens and full of flowers.  Was really optimistic, no instructions - i.e. how old is it? After the flowers died, it got fleas, which are soil related. It bugged my other plants. However, its a cutting of a shrub, not a bonsai. Its just stuck in a bonsai pot. Now I'm in the bug spraying mode- frustrating. It would have been easier to care for it as a plant, since its buggy. Now I have to train it into a bonsai. It seems root bound, but we're not supposed to anything the first year. Gardenias are hardy but delicate so I'm frustrated with spraying for bugs and for the season I have to bring it in and I hate bugs."
1,The Bonsai came pretty healthy looking with the majority of leaves being nice and green (only a couple were yellowing) and with many buds ready to open.  I watered it as directed and gave it a little fertilizer to help improve the yellowing leaves.  It did improve and it bloomed profusely.  I think it is natural for it to drop some leaves as it acclimates to it's new environment.  The flowers are now starting to fade away with the season for gardenia plants.  I have noticed some new growth already with new leaves which means the plant is growing and is still healthy.  I would recomend this plant to others who do not mind giving plants some extra attention.
1,"I will admit, I was very hesitant buying this after reading the 3 negative reviews on the main item page description, but I ordered it anyways, I always wanted a flowering bonsai as I only have had the pleasure of having regular bonsais. But when I received, it was extremely healthy and taken care of. Only 3 leaves needed to be trimmed due to discoloration from being inside the box. I know it will take time to flwoer and won't expect it right away. My only concern is that the potting soil is not what I expected. I expected it to be softer and easier like the soil is supposed to be with bonsais, but instead it was regular soil with wood and rock in it. When I got to transplant it later on, I will be fixing that for sure because I want it to grow up healthy.<br />But it's growing quite well and nothing was broken or dead. It was shipped out the next day and arrived at my house 3 days later. The other negative reviews probably had their shipping take longer and that is why the leaves were dissatisfying.<br />Awesome work on this little guy, I would buy from you again. :)"
1,"The tree came with no problems. It was packed well, no issues with the packaging or anything, it was all perfectly intact. It is very healthy, with a ton of buds and has no problems whatsoever. Fancy fancy little tree."
1,I received this as a gift and think it is a wonderful plant. Much better than cut flowers that will die off in a week. My bonsai arrived in really good condition with no broken branches and green leaves. It doesnt have any flowers or buds but I am hoping with a little love and care it may eventually get some Gardenias.
1,"I sent one of these to my Mom as a gift and she's still talking about it. Delivered quickly and in perfect condition and at a very good value. More importantly, she loves it!"
0,"PURCHASED AS A GIFT FOR MY WIFE. LOOKED GREAT ON ARRIVAL AND WENT DOWN HILL FROM THERE. THREE WEEKS LATER ALL GONE, UNLESS YOU LIKE MINATURE BROWN TREES!  IF I TOOK CARE OF IT I'D EXPECT THAT OUTCOME. BUT MY WIFE HAS A GREEN THUMB AND REALLY TRIED TO SAVE IT."
1,"i got this for my mom for mother's day, it came right away in the mail and already had flower buds on it, its very easy to take care of and the flowers are so pretty and they smell very nice. everyone has complemented her on it."
0,This gardenia tree looked so cute online and we love gardenias. It arrived with a note to hurry and purchase a tray to go under the pretty pot which has 2 draining holes. It was a surprise this was not included. The plant did however come complete with ectoparasites (something like green scales clinging to the branches) and white flies. It was also not as mature as shown in photo - more like 3 branches with scant green and yellow leaves.
1,"I was a bit hesitant about ordering this because of the mixed reviews.  However, the good seemed to outweigh the bad and this just looked like something my mother would like so I ordered it.  Ever the procrastinator, I ordered this for Mother's Day.  As I ordered it on a Wednesday (the 9th), I knew it wouldn't make it in time...SURPRISE - even though the The estimated date was the 15th (the following Tues), it actually arrived on the 11th in plenty of time for Mother's Day.  My mom called and told me it was gorgeous with lotzzz of flowers.  I asked her about the leaves, size, etc., all the warnings from some of the bad reviews and she said it was in perfect shape and she LOVED it."
1,"The plant came very well packaged & very fast.It came with two flowers on it, smelled so good. I know the gardenia is an indoor plant, but it started showing some yellow leaves,(I live on the west coast)so I put it outside where it get some early morning sun, no afternoon sun.It is doing very well!! In the winter we will bring it in. As for the pictue of the plant I saw on line and the one I recived are very differnt. Mine is more of a bush than a tree. But the price was only $31.00 and this is a bonsai so I can train it anyway I want. I am looking forward to putting my touch on this tree."
1,"I am really please with this bonsai. I can already see that it is going to bloom soon, i am so looking forward to the sight and the smell.<br />My only problem with this item is that i received it WITHOUT the plate that i shown on the pic. Amazon resent me the whole thing again (They can't send only part of the item) but still the plate didn't come with it.<br />I don't understand why i didn't get the item the way it was shown on the website....that's a pity i am quite disappointed."
1,"Shipment was delivered fast. Dogs love lamb ears, good for their teeth and healthy for them. Will purchase again."
1,"I found buying online by the 50-count box -- with free shipping -- considerably cheaper than buying individually at my local pet supply store. These are a nice size for my two small dogs, and<br />are very clean with no odor.  Many body part treats seem to be messy and smelly, but not these.  I recommend them for small dogs, a big dog would probably demolish one in 2 seconds.  Keeps my guys<br />busy for about 20 minutes."
0,"Product received quickly but unfortunate it gave my dog diarrhea after one lambs ear.  After waiting several days I tried again with same results.  Returned the lambs ears, placed an order for more lambs ears with a name brand that she had eaten before.  I went through the same company so they still got a sale.  Wish I had of waited before ordering.  I received a credit minus 6 missing lambs ears.  Since I had only taken two from the box, I figured I must have been shorted to begin with.  Meanwhile I paid shipping two ways and had a vet bill for $225.00 because the dog had to be put on antibiotics to clear up the diarrhea."
1,I received the plants in good condition and they have thrived since transplanting. They are now three times the size as when I got them. I would buy them again.
0,"Product was shipped lose in a large box, 3 times to large, resulting in the container breaking.  Most of the product was crushed, melted, and unusable. I will not be shopping with this supplier again."
1,"Items were received quickly, well packed and taste as great as any Andes mint. Worked out great for my tradeshow booth -- no cumbersome bowl refilling from bags of candy."
1,The Mints arrived with a chill pack to insure they would not melt in the summer heat! The jar is handy for serving and the mints are fresh and tasty. Recommend this product for entertaining and as a gift to send or bring.
1,Bought two of these for a green and blue candy buffet and these are perfect. They look great and are super tasty!
1,"Even though I did not get to eat any, my children told me they went through it like nothing and exclaimed they were DELICIOUS! I wasn't expecting anything less knowing that Andes mints are scrumptious ^_^"
1,Got these for a xmas gift. There is a lot of them in there to satisfy even the biggest mint fanatic!! Highly Recommend!! Great Deal!!
1,I ordered 2 different types of mint chocolate in the month of august and the one shipment from a competitor arrive all of the chocolate had melted.  Had expected the worse for the shipment of the Andes chocolate but to my surprise they had packed 4 ice packs with the chocolate and had no melted chocolate. Very impressed with service and chocolate and will be ordering more soon.
1,very good service recieved it alot earlier than expected I ordered right before christmas kinda late but recieved it in enough time for christmas  thank you great service
1,I've loved Andes ever since I was a kid.  I hide my stash in my room and nibble at it a little at a time like a mouse.  Beautiful blend of creamy chocolate and fresh mint!
1,My package was perfect. My husband is so happy because we can't find these mints in our area.
0,"The tablets had discolored from age.  These tablets are suppose to be yellow, not orange or rust colored.  I should have returned."
0,"ANYTHING is better than these.  Some taste bland.  Some taste like wax.  Most just taste really weird, kind of bitter, and just not Good.<br /><br />Here are some chocolates that taste a Lot better than these...<br /><br />Sees<br />Ghirardelli<br />Lindt<br />Reeses<br />Godiva<br /><br />Just to name a few...<br /><br />Even Palmer Chocolates found at Dollar Stores taste better than these!!"
1,"Just got this as a gift, and we were really impressed with the box/wrapping. The chocolate is good, but I think I've had better from Sees in general. This box has about 12 flavors per box. I think the hazelnut (?), chocolate (square one), and french vanilla (?) are really good- most have a light texture to the filling that is really nice. It would be nice if it came with a list of what the flavors are...<br />Oops- just noticed that this is $40 for 2 boxes. I think it's good enough to be $20. :)"
0,Just got this as a gift and it tastes like it's sold by junior highers to make money (like wrapping paper). it's not chocolate as much as it's cheap waxy choco-flavored covering a ball of sugar and lard. Do not buy this. Disgusting product. Don't be tricked.
1,"There is no better tasting tomato juice. Thick, rich, filled with vitamins. Yeah, it's still the old can and you have to use a can opener, but it's really worth it!"
1,"I've always been a fan of Figs, and these are the best I've tasted.  I don't like the dates and apricots as much but even if I could buy the Figs by itself, I'd probably still go for this mixed pack since it becomes a snack with a bit more variety and texture.  The figs are very soft with an odd crispness to the outside, while the other items are much more chewy.  Watch out for the small seeds though!"
1,"Tried these in a movie theater instead of popcorn and enjoyed them a lot. I felt I was doing something good for my body, too. They are a bit expensive though."
0,I purchased these and once home ate them and experienced a severe gluten reaction.  On the bag in small print at the bottom it said they were manufactured in a facility with wheat and dairy.  The label also stated that routine testing occurs only to maintain gluten free label status.  Our bag tested positive for gluten which caused severe bleeding.<br /><br />Please be careful when buying this brand as the statement is for CYA and labeling purposes only.  That way they can charge more for the product.
1,"My daughter and I both have celiac and these are my favorite gluten-free cookies. I loved ginger snaps and molasses cookies before I was diagnosed with celiac and this are a lovely indulgence in a sparce market. I dip them in milk, my daughter eats them plain. Good texture too!"
1,"This sandwich cookie is crisp, not too sweet and delicious with a cup of coffee or tea.  Really satisfies the craving for something to dip into your coffee."
1,"Out of all their different kinds of cookies, this is the one that rocks.<br /><br />You would never know this was gluten free."
1,We know a lot about GF producs in my house and my son really likes these cookies.  They are good Oreo substitutes.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the cookie part is very hard and brittle.
1,"My 5 yr. old son (Tyler) who is Autistic and had to go on the GF diet likes them very much. I found these cookies at Liz' Healthfood in Conway, AR. They taste almost like an Oreo. Great cookie."
1,"I keep these in the house at all times.  They are a fabulous cookie- nice taste, not hard or crumbly.  I also use them as a pie crust.  I put them in the blender to chop them up, then mix in a bowl with melted butter.  I spray my pie dish with non-stick spray before pressing it in the plate.  My family likes it as a crust for chocolate pie, but I've used them with others also and it turns out great.  I've never used them for baking pies so I can't recommend that, only for no-bake pies, cheesecakes, etc."
1,"I like all the gluten free flavors of cookies that Mi-Del makes.  These are a perfect ginger snap.  Yes, they are crunchy and spicy, but that is what I expect in a ginger snap.  They are wonderful to dip in milk.  The milk cools the spiciness and softens the cookie.  My kids like them so much I have to hide them if I want some left for later!"
1,These are the best gluten free cookies ever.  If you have had the real thing before you won't know the difference.  Even my friends that aren't allergic to gluten like these cookies.
0,The outer layer of the cookie is good but the center is far from creamy. It's rock hard and inedible IMO. I bought these and after eating a couple they sat in our pantry until they went stale and were tossed. I won't buy these again. However MI-DEL makes other cookie varieties that are delicious--my whole family loves the GF arrowroot animal cookies and the GF ginger snaps.
0,"These cookies are cloyingly sweet, i had to throw out the middle as it tasted like sugar! The cookies themselves are hard without much flavor. I wouldn't buy them again. I'm wondering what to do with those that are left."
1,"Not only will these cookies satisfy a ""sweet tooth"" attack, but they're healthy and will calm nausea and/or upset stomach.  Strong ginger flavor, not sugary, so although adults really like them, a lot of kids probably won't be crazy about them."
1,"These are some of the best mass-produced gluten-free cookies I have found.  (Never mind the gluten-free part -- most people could never tell that these ginger snaps are not made with wheat flour.)  They've got great snap and just the right amount of gingery heat.  When crushed and combined with a few other choice ingredients, they make a fantastic pie or dessert crust.<br /><br />So why only four stars?  Well, I've bought these ginger snaps many times at the grocery store, and never have I had so many broken cookies as in the box that Amazon sent.  The box itself showed no signs of damage, so I'm a bit puzzled as to what transpired in the Amazon warehouse or in transit.  All in all, however, I love the cookies and am pleased with the Amazon price.  I'll be ordering these again."
0,"Hard as a rock.  Some companies are able to make gluten free sweets palatable, but these are really not very good.  Soaked a cookie in milk for 5 minutes and it did not soften."
1,yummy! these are amazing. thanks midel for making delicious gluten free cookies. these melt in your mouth. most gluten free foods taste like cardboard but these are very tastey. i'm hooked....
1,"Found out I gotta go gluten to due to nursing a gluten intolerant baby , I love my gluten desserts so I have to have something good to eat. These Ginger snaps dipped in almond milk are soooo good mmmmmm mmmmm : )"
1,"I haven't been gluten-free my whole life, and Oreos were a common dessert item I used to have. These cookies are very similar in flavor, although the cream filling is a bit more crumbly. These do have corn and soy products in them, which I'm not fond of, but as an occasional treat isn't too horrid."
1,"I have been buying this cookies for a long time now, and enjoy them very much.  They taste great - as good as oreo cookies.  LOVE THEM, and will continue to buy them.  I recommend them highly to anyone who must eat Gluten-Free."
0,"We buy this type of product because of a health condition. We ordered these cookies fully expecting them to arrive in a some what good condition. Instead all we received was crumbs and partial cookies, there were very few whole cookies. I suspect the lack of care in the packaging was one of the main problems."
0,"I am a huge fan of ginger snaps. When recently diagnosed as needing to be gluten-free, and recently pregnant, I've been on the hunt for GF ginger snaps. I've tried three:<br /><br />Mi-Del Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br />Annie's Homegrown Ginger Snap Gluten Free Bunny Cookies<br />Mary's Gone Crackers Love Cookies Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br /><br />1. Mi-Del<br />Texture: a bit grainy. Crunchy, but crumbles in the mouth in that gluten-free grainy way that is not my favorite texture<br />Ginger flavor: middling, a tiny bit spicy on the tongue but not too much<br />Sweetness: sweet, like you'd expect a cookie to be<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick<br />Density: the most heavy or dense of the three<br />Overall 2 or 3 out of 5 stars<br /><br />2. Annie's<br />Texture: a bit grainy, but less so than Mi-Del. Very crunchy. Little goldfish-sized crackers perfect for kids or snacking.<br />Ginger flavor: the most mild of the three, has that gingery hint to it, but not enough where it is spicy or leaves a tingle on the tongue<br />Sweetness: mild, less sweet than Mi-Del. More like eating an animal cracker than cookie. Tastes great with a slice of cheese.<br />Size: about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch, and very thin<br />Density: light<br />Overall 4 out of 5 stars. If you wanted a kid-friendly cracker-like snack, this would be 5 of 5 stars<br /><br />3. Mary's<br />Texture: VERY crunchy, not at all grainy. Texture was the least ""gluten-free"" like of the three. Felt like I was eating a regular cookie.<br />Ginger flavor: very spicy. I could only eat two or three crackers before my tongue needed a break (but I'm not big on spicy foods in general so consider me on the sensitive side). I actually prefer a ginger cookie to be like this though. Plus, it killed my pregnancy nausea in minutes - bonus.<br />Sweetness: not as sweet as Mi-Del, but not as mild as Annie's. very pleasant to me.<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick, basically the same as Mi-Del.<br />Density: Ultra light, most airy in the center<br />Overall 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Everyone's tastebuds are different, but these were my perceptions. I personally want a ginger cookie with a good ""bite"" to it, and I really can't stand gluten-free products that are grainy in texture (which seems to be most of them). I want the texture to act like a regular gluten item.  For me, Mary's fit the bill exactly, and Annie's was a close second. Annie's was so different though, I'd eat Mary's as a cookie, and Annie's as a snack, so I could see having them both in the pantry.<br /><br />The one I still want to try is Pamela's, because it has great Amazon reviews. I just don't want to buy them in bulk until I try them, so I need to find them locally."
1,"""Oreos"" are America's favorite cookie. Frankly, I've never understood the fascination. But my kids sure do! They devour these cookies. I have tried them myself, and they are very similar to the gluten-containing version. But the important thing is that my kids love them and don't have to feel like they are missing out on a vital part of American childhood!"
1,I am on a gluten free diet and enjoy the ginger snaps as a snack.  My cookie jar is often empty as my husband loves to eat them too. We have bought them at major grocery and health food stores. It is wonderful to have fresh ones delivered.  The next order is for 2 boxes a month but then one box a month until winter.  I must try them in cooking:  sauerbraten or pie filling.  They are very tasty and great with tea or coffee.  I receive the MI-Del Ginger Snaps from Amazon.
1,"I received a basket of gluten free items for Christmas and these Midel cookies were included.  These cookies tasted just like Oreo's and, so far, they are the best gluten free cookies that I have found!  I do not understand why anyone would give them a bad review.  I am glad that we received them as a gift---we just love them!"
0,"The cookie part is ok, but the filling is not good at all. It is dry and splinters apart when bitten into. The taste is barely noticeable and then all of a sudden there is an odd chemical frosting taste. *sigh* I will continue searching for a gluten free cookie, but have resigned myself to the fact that I will have to cook most everything from scratch from now on. On the bright side, it will certainly make me plan ahead better and a more inventive cook."
1,"I purchased these cookies blind, I had not tasted this brand. They were a little crumbly, but not enough to affect the taste. I thought they were wonderful, with only a few broken ones in my delivered box. I would order these again."
1,"I really struggled  finding a decent replacement for Oreo's. This is the closest thing I've found. It is a bit more grainy, due to the rice flour but the crispness is there and the chocolaty sweet taste of and Oreo is satisfied. Use it for recipes as well."
1,"Good tasting cookie.  Will satisfy your sweet tooth.  Very hard, though.  Definitely good for dunking in your coffee!"
0,THESE LITTLE COOKIES ARE VERY SPICY.<br /><br />SO IF YOU LIKE VERY SPICY THINGS YOU WILL LOVE THESE.<br /><br />FOR ME I AM NOT ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE.........
1,I try to find different snacks for my girlfriend who is gluten intolerant. She really likes these and I have had a few myself and think they taste pretty good too!
1,"These Mi-Del Pecan cookies are excellent!  They are, like all gluten free stuff pretty hard (like trying to eat a poker chip) but if you dunk them in coffee, milk or (I use) Root Beer they soften up nice and taste great!"
0,"These are my least favorite of Mi-Del's gluten-free lineup -- which is sad, because I love chocolate and caramel and had high hopes.  However, these cookies are hard and dry.  I'd compare them to biscotti, but that would be unfair to biscotti because these have neither the delightfully craggy texture nor the depth of flavor that good biscotti do.  The ""chocolate"" part of the equation comes not from true chocolate, but from cocoa, which makes the flavor dull and flat.  The caramel flavor is not awful, but it's marred by the hard-candy-like texture of the caramel bits.  And when Mi-Del describes these as ""bite-size,"" they mean it:  These cookies are approximately the size of a nickel in diameter.<br /><br />If I were to do it all over again, I'd find a bag of these in a local store and try them first.  As it stands now, I'm stuck with a case of the lil' suckers."
1,"I WAS SCEPTICAL AT FIRST ABOUT A SANDWICH, GLUTEN FREE COOKIE.  BOY WAS I WRONG!  THEY TASTE GREAT!  HOWEVER, I HAD TO STOP EATING THEM, I AM ALLERGIC TO POTATO!  WHAT A BUMMER.  I WANTED A SANDWICH COOKIE AND THIS FIT THE BILL.  I BOUGHT A CASE, TOOK SOME COOKIES TO WORK AND EVERYONE IN THE OFFICE LOVED THEM.  (I AM THE ONLY ONE WITH CELIAC DISEASE IN THE OFFICE)  SO WHEN I COULD NO LONGER EAT THE COOKIES, THE OFFICE ATE ALL MY COOKIES!  THEY WANTED MORE.  I DIRECTED THEM TO AMAZON.COM.  THE LADIES IN THE OFFICE HAD NO IDEA, GLUTEN FREE COOKIES TASTED SO GOOD.  THEY HAVE ALSO EATEN MY CHOCOLATE CHIP, GINGERSNAPS, SHORTBREAD COOKIES TOO.  SO THESE COOKIES APPEAL TO EVERYONE!"
1,"Finding gluten free products that taste decent is a challenge and I bought a box of these cookies expecting them to taste ""good"" but still, with an off taste from being gluten free. Wow, was I wrong! These cookies are amazing!! They are shaped like animals, light, crunchy, buttery, and a hint of lemon. These are hands down the best cookies I've had in my life, including ""regular"" cookies, and this is the first time I can actually say a gluten free item tastes better than its gluten counterpart.<br /><br />My WalMart sells these for 3.38/bag and I got them here for a bit over 2.00/bag with subscribe and save. This will definitely be a staple in our household! We've eaten an entire bag in less than 24 hours. Nobody could ever guess that these cookies are gluten free, they are AMAZING!!"
1,"We love these cookies, better than ""K"" vanilla.  My husband is not gluten free, and this is his favorite cookie too.  Yes, they are a crisp cookie (some may call hard), but that is why I like them.  They have a rich vanilla flavor which the ""K"" cookies do not. I carry these in my purse when when we are dining out so I have a gluten free dessert, restaurants never mind this.  For chocolate, we still like the ""K"" chocolate the best. Note: I use the auto delivery every 6 month for a better price."
1,"These are so tasty! Just the perfect amount of sweetness! They are nicely brown around the edges, so delicious!"
1,"Mi-Del Gluten-Free Ginger Snaps are the only gluten free cookies I've found that I would put on par with really good regular cookies. Besides a taste that I enjoy, they have a nice slightly chewy texture. You'll be doing double takes to make sure the label actually says gluten-free."
1,"These are the best ""wheat"" free cookeis.<br />This was a great price and availabiltiy.<br />Would love to business again! Thanks."
1,"These ginger snaps are delicious with a lot of ginger flavor. They are good alone or with fruit, and they make an excellent substitute for graham cracker crumb crust, especially with lemon merengue pie. We love them. No one would ever guess they were also gluten-free."
1,"I use these cookies to make gluten free cheesecake crusts.<br />I turn them into crumbs using a chopper and then use these crumbs in place of the graham crackers in the recipe.<br />I also use less butter than the recipe asks for in the crust as the cookies have some oil already in them.<br />Anyway the cookies taste great as a gluten free cheesecake crust and everyone gives compliments ;-)<br /><br />My husband and I also like to eat these cookies with pudding by Kozy Shack, which is also gluten free."
1,"The flavor of my first bite was unbelievably intense.  I've tried numerous GF cookies, these are my favorite by a long shot. The package has been redesigned, it is now cream & blue in color."
1,I will buy these cookies again. I am glad that I order them regardless of the not so good reviews.
1,"To date, this is the only gluten free cookie I've tried and absolutely loved.  They have a livelier flavor than vanilla wafers and are sweeter (but not too sweet) than what you expect from regular animal crackers.  I subscribed to these and am glad they come in the bulk quantity they do, since even my gluten-loving coworkers devour them as soon as they see they're out for taking."
1,"Delicious? Check!<br />Gluten free? Check!<br />Good price? Check!<br /><br />Thank you, amazon, for making these great cookies available!  It is difficult finding things to eat when you have a gluten intolerance and it is even HARDER finding things to eat that TASTE GOOD!<br /><br />All of the celiacs in my family enjoy these animal crackers! Five stars!"
1,"Mi-Del Ginger Snaps are far better in texture and flavor than any I have ever purchased. I have eaten many varieties of ginger snaps in my 85 years of life, and appreciate this as an exceptionally good product.  The only problem I have is that I can't stop eating them!"
1,"My grandson's gluten allergy led me to these cookies because animal cookies are a tradtional Christmas gift for children in our family. Our entire family loves them, but the real test is on unsuspecting gluten consuming individuals and they past the test. Recently the contractor came by in the afternoon with his son's 8 and 10 years old.  They looked hungry and so I offered cookies, with Dad's permission.  They almost wiped out the bag. Good Cookies!"
1,"These animal cracker cookies taste the most like the ""other"" kind that I have tried so far.  So much fun to eat with the grandchildren."
1,My son loves these cookies! They're tasty and reasonable-2 traits which often don't describe gluten free baked goods! Enjoy!
1,"These are great cookies.  I have two girls with celiac disease, one is a toddler. Finding foods that are like the ""real"" thing is tough these are a great treat and we love them!"
1,"These cookies are a wonderful replacement for any kid ( or grown up ) wanting to eat a long time favorite. There is about 80 cookies per bag, so it makes it well worth the money spent. They are light, buttery and crispy making them great for milk. These pack well in bags for lunch  ( don't break up easily ) so they would do great in a kid's lunch for school or daycare. I actually give these cookies to people to show them gluten free doesn't mean cardboard."
1,These ginger snaps aren't too overpowering on the ginger and go great with some milk. Really enjoyed having these in the house and they are a great buy - so affordable compared to most alternative diet foods. They'll last for at least a week or so and store well.
1,I love these cookies.  I can't eat gluten and they are a healthy treat. Family members who can eat gluten enjoy them also.
1,"Ginger Snaps are delicious.  Not too sweet and loaded with flavor. Wonderful texture, great with a nice cup of tea."
1,Very good gluten free animal cookies... We use them as re-inforcers for my son.  Very good product.
1,I picked the Cinnamon Snaps up at my Grandma's local health food store the last time I visited and loved them.  I have yet to try the ginger snaps but I'm sure they are just as good.  Hopefully Amazon will start carrying the Cinnamon Snaps.
1,"These are one of the two best gluten free animal cookies on the market.  The other being: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E48IP6"">EnviroKidz Organic Gluten-Free Animal Cookies, Vanilla, 9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>  I prefer Mi-Del because they are more economical than EnviroKidz and my daughter loves these cookies."
1,"Even if you're able to eat regular cookies (not Gluten free) you'll love these. Really sweet, and incredibly tasty. Since I can't have Gluten in my diet, these have become my staple desert. I buy them two cases at a time so I'll never run out."
1,Hard to find products that my son's diet allows him to eat.  This is a great treat.  He loves them.  I have a hard time keeping out of the opened bag of cookies myself.  They are crunchy but we love them.
1,"These ginger cookies are great if you are on a gluten-free diet. They are spicy, not too sweet and are great for dunking!"
0,This cookie is too hard to bite into and the center is like eating crispy sugar.  I did not care for these at all and now I have a whole case of them.  Guess they will end up as a pie crust or something.
1,"These are spicy, and my kids love them too. They are crispy and I am SO glad I found these after being diagnosed with Celiac."
1,"Thanks to hubby's recent diagnosis of gluten allergy, I've begun to explore the world of gluten free foods. While some are quite bland, these little cookies pack a flavorful punch! Nothing ""depriving"" here."
1,These Ginger Snaps were very good but I ordered the gluten free ginger snaps and they were shipped in error and all my complaints to Amazon were ignored.<br />Bill
0,"I ordered these for my son (age 11). He doesn't like them at all. I thought they would be similar to the Kinnikinnick cookies we get at our local health food store, but they're not. These are rock hard and although sugary, otherwise have no flavor. We'll stick with the Kinnikinnicks. I'm just hoping maybe I can use these for making a cookie crumb crust."
1,"I love these and it is the best treat.  I love cookies and couldn't find one that was very good until I found these.  I can eat a whole bag in one day!  Matter of fact, I need to order another case."
1,These cookies are so good - you'd never know that they were wheat free!  The bags are not filled anywhere near full (my only compliant - too much packaging) so a package of 8 is not really too much.  2 bags of cookies will fit in a medium clamp-top glass jar (which is how I store them in my kitchen)  Looking forward to trying the Chocolate cookies next...
1,"I have a 4 yr old and a 2 yr old that can't eat gluten and this is an awesome products for them. We always have some with us where ever we go and they absolute love them. They are moderately sweet and crunchy.<br />They also make a wonderful pie crust. 1 1/2 cup cookie crumbs, 5 TBS margerine, 1 TBS surgar. Mix and pat into pie plate. Bake 10 min at 350 degrees.<br />We couldn't live without them. Thanks Mi-Del!!!"
1,"Mi-Del: Slightly cheaper per ounce, crackers are actually animal shaped, butter cookie taste (like those that come in a tin around the holiday season)<br /><br />Envirkidz: Square cookie/cracker, vanilla flavor<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E48IP6"">Nature's Path EnviroKidz Organic Gluten-Free Animal Cookies, Vanilla, 9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />Both have similar nutrition profiles (calories, fat, grams of carbohydrate) and are GF.<br /><br />My shipment was not stale, unlike the other reviewer's complaint. Both taste fine and I find I can't put the box down sometimes, but I am not a big sugar/butter cookie fan, so I think I prefer the Envirokidz. Definitely a better deal than the local health food store and, trust me, you WILL be able to eat the whole box before they expire."
1,"Great replacement for traditional animal cookies.  My daughter, like me, cannot have gluten but loves these cookies.  I even serve them as a snack for the nursery at church.  The kids love them.... and here at Amazon, they are the right price for sharing."
1,"Although made with butter (my son is GF/CF), my son has no digestive or behavior problems after eating these.  He's thrilled to be able to have animal crackers again.  They are perfect for school snack or in the car.  The cookies are tasty enough that Mom and Dad (who do eat wheat) will snack on them as well.  They are quite pricey in the store, but Amazon's subscription price makes them fairly affordable - and much easier than always making homemade."
1,"Both my kids (8 and 4) love these cookies.  They have always been really crunchy.  We've never had them mushy like in another review.  They are not too sweet and have fun shapes.  Great for anyone gluten sensitive, and everyone else in the family."
0,"Sadly, the cookies in this shipment  were soft (they should be crunchy).  I now only buy them from the store self where they are fresh."
0,"If you are looking for mild ginger flavored snaps...these are not it.  If you however, enjoy a very strong ginger taste, give these a try."
0,"These cookies were AWFUL!  Really bad.  My co-worker and I each bit into one and we couldn't finish it.  I tried one a week or so later when I was really hungry and it was still terrible.  Not only do they not taste good, but instead of being bland, they actually taste BAD and leave a horrible aftertaste.  I buy a lot of Gluten Free products and almost everything is really good but this was far from it."
0,"Took FOREVER to arrive and the case is way too many cookies to consume! Will stick to my local organic grocery next time. Once again, ordering food from Amazon has fallen far below expectations."
0,Wow! I've been buying dog treats for over 40 years and this one takes the cake! Pay no attention to the photo in the advertisement for this product. What you get is two (2) small chews in each of three (3) shrink wrapped over cardboard packages. That's a total of six (6) small chews for $30.00 not including shipping! I couldn't return my order quick enough.
0,"I was not impressed about this product (Made in China). Cheaply made and not very good quality. Outside was coated with redish brown sweet something which stained the carpet.  My dog first tried to lick the coating and then bit the ""bone"".  It was like hard leather, more than bone, and left a mess of shreds about as well."
1,"Okay, my chihuaha is finicky...i have wasted lots of money on other rawhide chews and finally found one! Thank you beefeaters."
1,"My little yourkie absolutely loves these treats. He chews all the chicken off first, which I think helps keep his teeth clean, and then goes to work on the rawhide.<br /><br />GREAT product, but the packaging wasn't too great. The bones were falling out when I got them... a little concerning."
1,Each evening before going to bed my dog gets a chick n top.  It relaxes her with a treat that she really enjoys.
1,"My hound is surprisingly picky about treats.  But these are his all time favorites.  He, Wimsey, likes all the chicken top/treated Beefeater products"
0,THIS IS NOT A PACK OF 12 BUT OF 3. I AM VERY UNHAPPY. PRODUCT IS NOT AS DESCRIBED  DO NOT ORDER IF YOU EXPECT 12 BONES. RIP OFF.  AMAZON SHOULD BE ASHAMED.
1,"My 30 pound puppy goes crazy for these, he really loves them.  He's just in heaven when he's chewing on one of these, but they only last about 20 minutes.  If you're looking for something that lasts much longer than a biscuit but doesn't need to last for hours like other rawhide treats then this is perfect."
1,"I like the convenience of subscribe & save along with the box sizes which makes it convenient to give to day care for our son as well as carrying it with you in his diaper bag (either the full box or a few of the packets inside the box). Even when traveling it was convenient to carry the packets rather than a box which when opened is always spilling out.<br /><br />As for the taste, our son loves it. We have tried other Earth's organic product like the food jars and our son loves all their products."
1,"We've used this cereal many times for our twins and have had no problems. It's a great brand.  Earth's Best rice cereal is made from whole brown rice whereas this one lists organic whole oat flour as the first ingredient.  Flour compared to whole grain, for the same price.  That first ingredient is a qualitative difference, whole rice versus oat flour, is the reason we go for the rice one when we can.<br /><br />I have to load up at the store when they have Earth's Best rice cereal. They always have this one, the Whole Grain Oatmeal Cereal though. This one is never sold out.<br /><br />Both of the two above-mentioned cereals work perfectly in formula, mixing right in as you'd want. Our babies are growing and they liked these cereals the moment they were introduced. Of course, one has to test a food out on one's baby(s). You never know if for some reason your baby will have a negative reaction. But we've had a very positive experience with Earth's Best. We also subscribe through Amazon to several Earth's Best baby food jars."
1,"I was thrilled when they developed Diet Moxie as I usually drink diet soda. This is faithful to the recipe of the regular Moxie, without sacrificing too much of what makes Moxie Moxie. For a very limited product (only really available in scattered locales in New England), I was frankly surprised that they would produce a diet edition, but am very happy that they have. I understand all the reservations the full-octane drinkers have about diet drinks, but if you love Moxie as I do, your avenue is not cut off for enjoying the flavour of it if you need a diet variety."
1,"I was very pleased to discover a few years ago that HometownFavorites continues to sell Moxie, which according to Wikipedia has ""a unique flavor that is not as sweet as that of most modern soft drinks and that is described by some as bitter"".  Most sodas are too yucky sweet for my taste, but Moxie has a zingy flavor that I really like.<br /><br />Even so, I don't drink any non-diet soda (non-nutritional junk, imho), so I'm glad that a diet version is available.  I've bought it both directly from HometownFavorites and via Amazon.<br /><br />Some of its appeal to me is undoubtedly nostalgia for a regional brand from New England, where I grew up. (I don't recall actually drinking the stuff as a kid.  It was out of fashion by that time, and like most kids, I probably wouldn't have liked the slightly bitter taste.)  If you're looking for a soda for grownups, you might like Moxie."
1,"I don't care for Moxie, but my husband remembers it from when he was young and loves it.  We order a couple of times a year for him to enjoy.  My 10 year old grandson loves the taste also.  Will buy again from seller, very fast shipping.  Shipping costs are a little expensive."
1,If you ever wanted the fine taste of used motor oil in a soft drink then Moxie is the One for you!  And now you can get Diet Moxie with the same old flavor with none of whatever diet drinks are supposed to take out!
1,"I originally purchased from my local Wegmans supermarket in mid-March 2011, but they no longer carry it.  My brother and I found this to be a delicious sauce, though much spicier than other Kung Pao sauces we were used to.<br /><br />I highly recommend it, and will be ordering from Amazon as it is actually less expensive than ordering from Starport directly.<br /><br />The ""heat level"" is probably closer to or slightly more than the ""heat"" of a product like Gold's Szechuan Duck Sauce, which is usually easier to find in the Philadelphia area.<br /><br />One other note:  this has the unusual name of ""GENERAL Kung Pao Sauce"", which I had never seen associated with ""Kung Pao"" before.  I only every saw ""General"" with ""Tso"", as in ""General Tso's Sauce"".  And, as I inquired about availability from other local retailers, they invariably thought I meant ""General Tso"". Surprisingly, Starport did not provide an image; I copied this from their website in case you want to share with friends or show to a local retailer ~ hope Starport doesn't mind...)."
1,"Our local Bristol Farms market offers a stir fry bar with various asian sauce flavors.  I tried their kung pao sauce and was quite impressed with its spicy, intense and smoky flavor.  I wanted to find out what was in the sauce in the hopes of making it at home.  When I inquired of the person behind the counter he showed me a large bottle of the General Kung Pao sauce.  I ordered several bottles from Amazon.com and found it just as delicious as the offering at Bristol Farms.  You need do little more than cut up your favorite vegetables (and meat, if so inclined), place some oil in a wok, and pour in this pre-made sauce.  I usually make my stir fry sauces from scratch.  When time is short I now reach for the General Kung Pao sauce."
1,"I ordered this for a friend for Mothers Day and she cannot stop raving about it!<br />The shoe is well crafted and the packaging well done.  It's a delightful gift, something definitely different and I just ordered another one for a Birthday present!<br />  Jayme Wills"
0,"The description says 12/5 oz bottles, but you only get one bottle. What a rip off! The sauce is delicious, but you'd be better off buying from the manufacturer ([&#8230;]). Or if you are in Boulder, stop by Vitamin Cottage ([&#8230;])."
0,"This is great hot sauce, but this is false advertising. Only one bottle will be sent, and they'll charge  $10 for shipping it--$20 per 5 oz of hot sauce. Totally absurd. Notice that they still haven't changed the description!"
1,"I remember whipping up a batch of these bad boys when I was about 14 years old (I'm 22 now) I went to town on the whole batch! After a while I noticed almost everyone stopped selling these even Wallmart who usually tries to provide products for as long as they can. I almost thought they were discontinued and I was heartbroken when everyone stopped selling them at local stores, but Amazon is like my retail hero! They keep all of the best stuff in stock and they stay in contact with people who distribute. I even found U.S. military issue meals ready to eat here on Amazon.com. I don't trust eBay with anything! Thanks for keeping these available Amazon.com! I Will be ordering them when i have the money! They seem a bit pricy tome here."
1,WOW!!!!  these are Easy and fantastic!!!!  I will be buying these again.  If you need a quick desert this is it!  3 step process and then put them in the fridge for 30 minutes to firm up.  The end result is fantastic.  they were much better than I expected.  Everything in the process worked just as easy as it looked from the instructions.  Usually I make this kind of thing from scratch but not anymore.
1,"I've been using Turmeric powder for years after I read how beneficial it is for many health problems.  Prevention  is my way, whenever possible, to combat the possibilities.  At least I can try and be in control of my own health care.  It's tasteless and add a nice color to eggs."
1,"First Impression: The friendly folks over at ""Exclusively Dog"" heard about my website and sent me 5 of their products to test.<br />Let me just start off by saying that I Love how sweet all of these treats taste. Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4."
1,They look and smell like human cookies so keep away from children (or your dog will be upset!).
1,"A family member brought this product to St. Martin where we were vacationing.  The six of us ate it with a variety of crackers and it was delicious!  We finished the whole thing in one sitting.  The foi gras is thick but fairly easy to spread as long as you have a sturdy cracker, and it has a delicate flavor that I love.  There is a nice layer of fat at the top."
1,"As a California resident who feared the loss of access to Foie Gras  mandated in July, I stocked up on Rougie Duck Foie Gras.  It is not as good as the product we purchased in Paris and brought back with us in January, but it was all I could find that was affordable.  Store in Refrigerator and note the long shelf life. Very tasty."
0,"So, Amazon, you're back to selling whale meat, fois gras, and other gross foods?  What gives?  Is it because few American's eat it, or even know what it is?  And, it's expensive which helps your bottom line.  So, why not take stuff American's don't or are forbidden to eat (remember the ban on whale slaughter is now world wide and it makes your selling of it illlegal).  People are becoming more informed on a daily basis, and finding this kind of stuff on Amazon is little less than appalling, much less, law disregarding."
1,"The item was received in only a few days of placing the order, and it was in excellent condition.  As it was milk for cats, I personally have no knowledge as to the quality, taste, etc (I love the cat but there are limits!) but the only important qualification was that my cat enjoyed it, and he surely did, so it's a winner all around.  Thank you very much."
1,"My husband has been a Diabetic for years........and until Diabeti Sweet came out.......it was a real problem to try and bake any items for him, that would taste, bake and LOOK like the item was supposed to.<br /><br />Diabeti Sweet looks like real sugar....feels light real sugar....and weighs like real sugar....thus when you make a cake, or cookies or any other item......it comes out looking just like the original recipe made with real sugar.  When you use ""those other"" sugar substitutes, they don't have any weight, as a result, your cake is flat both is looks and taste....your cookies never set up, because there is no volume to them.<br /><br />Diabeti Sweet IS the best thing since sliced pickles!"
1,We love these!  This was a great deal as these are sold for much more at our supermarket as I bought this at about ten bucks here.  Chewy and very spicy so beware..if you love cinnamon you'll like these. Mine don't expire until 2013.
1,"I have been purchasing the cinnamon Mentos from my local stores, but they no longer handle the product, plus it cost over a $1 a roll when I could find them.  I was very happy to find them because cinnamon is my favorite and the grandchildren love them too."
1,Cinnamon mentos are my favorite flavor! We can't find them in the stores anymore. This is great to buy them by the box and at a good price. Thanks for my place to shop.
0,"I got these cause of the reviews,these are not cinnamon enough for me,just okay. But great for gifts for halloween."
1,I love the cinnamon mentos and they are hard to find in my area. I would probably not purchase them again unless the price goes down.
1,Could beat this deal - I will buy it again if it shows up under the deal of the  day.  Enjoyed my everyone.  Watch for this to go on sale again.
1,This is the second time I've sent this assortment as a gift and both recipients (one age 20 and one age 50) raved about the beautiful arrangement and the delicious taste of each and every piece of fruit.  Both times the present was shipped promptly and arrived exactly on time as promised and in excellent condition.
1,I ordered this dried fruit selection as a Chanukah gift for my mother. She loved it. Her gift was well packed and arrived (after a serveral day delay due to mishandling by USPS) in perfect condition. The fruit quality was excellent. She and her friends have really enjoyed it.
1,This item arrived a day ahead of my friend's birthday.  She had it in time to save herself a lot of trouble preparing for some guests.  They all loved the fruit and the beautiful presentation.
0,Hate to give a gift that turns bad...and this was horrible.  The absolute worst fruit.  I tried this and the only thing that was decent were the apricots and pineapple rings.
1,Better fruit then you can get at the grocery store.  The dates rolled in coconut are very good.  All of the fruit is soft and sweet.  I would recommend this as a gift and I will probably buy it again.
0,The actual package received is not at all as shown in the product picture.  This seriously reduces the value.<br /><br />Beware the other Black Friday or Cyber Monday savings from this company.<br /><br />Shame on Amazon for kicking off the holiday season with this bait and switch.<br /><br />I'm happy with Amazon 95% of the time.  They missed on this one.<br /><br />Postscript:  Amazon refunded a large enough portion of the purchase price to satisfy me.  Kudos for their honorable response.
1,"My mother loves dried fruit, and was thrilled with this fruit tray. It was as beautiful as in the pictures, and the quality of the fruit was unrivaled. I will be buying from Broadway Basketeers again."
1,"This basket of dried fruit was very good. It arrived before the date promised, and was in excellent condition. I have had dried fruit from other merchandisers,but this was the best I have ordered in quite a while. I order quite a bit of merchandise from Amazon and am well pleased with their suppliers. I recommend Amazon to all my friends."
1,"very pleased with this item.  Had almost everything I was looking for, packaged nicely, and the product was delicious!  Definitely would do it again!"
0,I thought these were going to be dried fruit. Turns out it is dried but full of sugar. Not what I needed. Taste is ok though.
1,My mother in law loved the agreement of the basket and the assortment of the fruit.  I was pleased how quickly it arived.  Thank you.
1,"This was purchased for the ""fruit wedding anniversary"" (4th year)  gift. It was perfect since the couple had everything they needed and something edible would not clutter their home. The fruit basket for the most part looked like the image, but the plastic wrapping was poorly done which cheapened the overall aesthetic. The fruit was mostly tasty. There was some that I didn't like, but it could be a matter of personal taste. Everyone else who tried it loved it."
1,"Item arrived with no problems. It was packaged well and looked wonderful.<br />I don't know if the fruit was any good, since it was a gift for my boss and his wife. They said they liked it, but would have said that even if they hadn't.<br />I was happy with the purchase."
1,"I ordered this a month or so ago as a bereavement gift, wanting the family to have something other than the arboretum of slowly dying flowers one usually gets at a time like that. It was very well-received and greatly appreciated--and as I was told, VERY delicious. What I initially thought might be odd for the occasion turned out to be the perfect gift."
1,Ahmad fruit flavored teas are my favorite.  So glad that Amazon is carrying them now.  I had to rely on one box here and there in Marshalls but now I can stock up.<br /><br />All the flavors are very natural tasting and the tea is full bodied and satifying.
1,"Here in North Texas we drink iced tea almost every day throughout the year.  I first tried Ahmad Strawberry Tea when it was enclosed with a tea set I purchased for our daughter.  My whole family loved it.  The mango and peach/passion fruit teas are also good, but strawberry ranks as our favorite flavor.  After our local market stopped carrying the Ahmad line, we have been half-heartedly trying other fruit teas, but they don't compare; many of them seem more like Kool-aid with a slight tea flavor.  I look forward to trying other flavors that we weren't able to find in our area."
1,"This product is by far the best brand flavored tea I have ever tasted.  I find that other brand flavored teas have such a wonderful aroma, however, the tea tends to be bitter--tasting nothing like the intended fruited flavor.  The Ahmad strawberry tea has a rich and smooth strawberry flavor, no matter how long I allow the tea bags to steep.  My family loves it as iced tea--as do I. We enjoy it so much, I make full, three-quart pitchers at a time and its always gone by the end of the day.  This year, I have already purchased four large boxes--20ct/6 bx--120 tea bags per box and now am purchasing the last of the 10 ct/12 bx box. I've gotten some great deals on here (as low as $.12 cent/tea bag)--on the internet, this tea runs $.18-.20/tea bag which adds up when you are buying 120-240 ct boxes."
0,"Have ordered the strawberry tea bags for over a year, this order I received strawberry sensation tea bags. Don't like the strawberry sensation, wanted just strawberry."
1,"with some teas, most i've tried actually you have a tinny odd taste once the tea starts to go cold...  with this tea however it kept its flavor to the last bit in the cup, which by then was cool in temp..  i couldn't believe it really how consistent it was.. and the aroma right out of the package was phenomenal.. each bag is individually wrapped as well.  I really don't think i can drink anything else now that i've had this tea.."
1,"I RECEIVED A VALENTINE GIFT, AND 2 BAGS OF THS TEA WAS IN IT.......I TRIED IT AND IT IS THE BEST..I AM A TEA LOVER AND I JUST HAD TO HAVE MORE OF THIS...SO I ORDERED IT AND STILL LOVE ITS TASTE..I DRINK ONE EVERY MORNING TO START MY DAY.....LOVE IT...."
1,I never thought I'd like fruit flavored tea until I had the Ahmad brand products. This one is my favorite with the peach passion fruit and mango being my other favorites. The flavor is that of a black tea with an aroma of strawberry that isn't overpowering or artificial tasting. This is a superb tea to drink before bed. The price on Amazon is almost half that of the stores so I hope they continue to carry it!
1,My MOM has been drinking this tea for years.  Was paying WAY too much.  Since I found this on amazon she is thrilled!  SUPER FAST delivery!  I hope to continue ordering.  Thanks.  Great seller!
1,"I really enjoy this tea as an afternoon treat with a little honey. I love the strawberry flavor, it doesn't taste fake or tinny."
0,"This Tea is just the best ever. I originally bought this tea in London, I struggled to find it here. Until I found it on Amazon. I have had a subscription for about a year now. The only problem is that the last 2 shipments have been for Strawberry Sensation and not for the Original Strawberry they are both good but I prefer the Strawberry. DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO CONTACT AMAZON REGARDING THIS CONCERN? I wouldn't mind having a subscription for both, but amazon.com doesn't have the option for the Strawberry Sensation and it's shipping me the wrong type of tea. DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO CONTACT AMAZON REGARDING THIS CONCERN?"
1,This is my favorite tea.  Who knew strawberry tea could be so juicy.  Give it a try.  You will be pleasantly surprised.
1,This tea has a Smooth and Fruity flavor. Great flavor. Tastes like drinking strawberry jam. It's always a favorite in my tea chest.
1,This is my favorite Ahmad Tea.  Very light strawberry flavor.  Perfect for an afternoon treat or nightime with cookies.  I order this because I can't get it locally.
1,"Authentic strawberry scent and flavor, very tasty both hot or iced, the best one in the Ahmad lineup of flavored teas, not because I'm a fan of strawberry fruit but because this tea is mild tasting yet full of flavor (while the other Ahmad varieties have a less authentic flavor and leave a generic bitter taste in the mouth which the strawberry one doesn't)"
1,"I was hesitant ordering something live unseen.  The plant came sturdily packed, promptly and healthy.  I was very pleased!"
1,"I really do wish money grew on trees because then the taller the tree got, the more money I'd get! lol! All kidding aside, when I bought this MONEY TREE from Amazon it arrived as a ""baby plant"". It is now a tall plant/tree. I have repotted it once. Cannot wait to see how tall it really gets. I would say that it has grown at least 6 or 7 inches, and looks healthy and unique!<br />~S. Plaza"
1,"I really enjoy this flavor! Its great over ice, refreshing and much less sugar and carbs than regular juice. If you need to cut down on carbs, sugar, calories this is a unique alternative to orange juice. I bought it on sale because it is very expensive otherwise.<br />You can tell its a good quality product."
1,"First, Luzianne makes the best classic brewed iced tea, hands down.  The family sized bags make 1 quart per bag, 48 quarts per box, 12 gallons of iced tea x 6 boxes @ $4.72 a box, thats 72 gallons of iced tea, certainly enough for the summer season and then some, plus free shipping if you play your cards right and order something else; you just can't beat that.  You can't get Luzianne cheaper anywhere else.<br /><br />So stop buying the instant iced tea mix crap, get some of these bags and brew your own."
1,"I love this tea.  It's so yummy for making iced tea with.  I can't find it in the grocery stores in Seattle, so I order it through amazon.  With a 48-count box I will not run out for a long time!"
1,"Besides the fantastic taste, these are the only ice tea bags that I have been able to use in my Mr Coffee tea brewer that do not cloud up the liquid after refrigeration!"
1,"Just had this tea with dinner, iced.  This tea beats Lipton hands down.  I would wager that in a blind test taste anyday.  In my opinion these tea bags when steeped, make a bolder tasting tea.<br /><br />It has a great dark color, and when made as iced tea, tastes great and is refreshing.  One 48 ct package seems to last my household forever.<br /><br />Great way to add even more flaver:  After you are done brewing a batch of tea, add fresh mint trimmings to the mixture, let it sit for a while.  Adds a great mint flaver to an already great tasting tea.  We do this in the summer time on a weekly basis.<br /><br />This deal that Amazon is offering is actually a GREAT offer and I may have take advantage of this soon.<br /><br />If you are a die hard Lipton drinker, I beseach you to try this just once, I believe you will find it better in quality than what you have been drinking.<br /><br />Remember tea is relatively healthly, drinking this instead of Coke is always a good substitution.  After all Coke-Cola will rust a nail to nothing if you leave it submerged, what's drinking it doing to your body?<br /><br />Hope this helps, and have a good day."
1,"There is no other suitable alternative. If your are making Southern Sweet Tea, the options are use Luzianne or don't bother. I'm not really sure what to say other than that. The discrepancy in quality between Luzianne and its next closest competitor is huge. It is such a big difference that Luzianne is worth ordering if it is not available in your area.<br />THE Southern Sweet Tea recipe is:<br />- 1 part boiling water<br />- 3 parts hot water(not boiling)<br />- 1 family-size Luzianne tea bag per cup of boiling water (use more bags for more flavor)<br />- 0.25-0.75 part granulated sugar (depending on taste)<br /><br />1) Pour boiling water over tea bags (DO NOT AGITATE, JUST POUR)<br />2) Let steep for 5 minutes without agitation (don't stir, don't squeeze, don't do anything!)<br />3) Remove tea bags quickly without squeezing or draining and discard<br />4) Pour steeped tea into hot water<br />5) Mix in sugar and stir until dissolved<br />6) Serve over ice"
1,"I'm from the south and Cold Sweet Iced Tea is like water. I'm very picky about it and it has to be freshly brewed and sweet'n to perfection while it's still warm. I do use a tea maker to brew it nearly daily.  I like to add a little Mint as well (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E67210"">Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Mint Magic, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>). Not to strong either.<br /><br />Obviously being so picky I've tried many different kinds of black teas and this is just my favorite. 2 Family bags to a gallon, one Mint tea bag and little over a cup of sugar pure cane.  Some people like it like liquid candy and others I know like it just barely sweet. I'm in the middle. I want to be able to taste the tea herb flavor but for it not to be bitter.<br /><br />Hope this helps. I highly recommend it ;)"
1,Living here in the Pacific Northwest it is hard to find this brand so I had to settle for Lipton.  When I saw this on Amazon I couldn't pass it up.  Quick delivery too.<br /><br />I make mine the sun tea way and it comes out perfect.  No bitter taste like I used to get with Lipton.  Nice color too.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys their ice tea.
1,I use these bags exclusively to make iced tea with either an iced tea pot or hot water in a reusuable bottle.  It has the best flavor of any tea on the market and amazon has the best price and quick shipping.  This is a great item for a subscription if you use as much iced tea as I do.
1,"Lipton and Nestea have nothing on Luzianne.<br /><br />This is the best tea for daily brewed tea, or iced tea. Period.<br /><br />This pack of six boxes of 48 count bags is a bargain, even with shipping costs.<br /><br />We in the south make the best iced tea you'll find so here is how to make souther-style iced tea:<br /><br />Ingredients<br />6 to 8 tea bags of Luzianne tea<br />1 & 1/2 qurts of cold water<br />1 Cup of sugar<br />lemon slices<br />lots of clean clear ice<br /><br />Equipment: large-sized well cleaned and strerilized pickle or maynoise jar with screw lid.<br /><br />Directions<br /><br />Place the water in the jar and add the tea bags. Place in a sunny locqtion for one to three hours. Pour warm tea into empty pitcher. Add the sugar and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Fill remaining pitcher with ice!!! and lemon slices."
1,"New Jersey equals Lipton Tea which equals yucky. I missed my southern tea.<br />Amazon, as always, saved my life. I now buy it by the case.<br />I love you Amazon and I LOVE Luzianne Tea. best in the world."
1,"LOVE IT, LOVE IT LOVE IT!!! I'm so happy with the Luzianne Iced Tea Family size tea bags. The flavor is wonderful. I had forgotten that Luzianne had Burl Ives promote this lovely tea back in the 50's-60's. Recommend to anyone who is skeptical of the price.  Well worth it...."
1,"After moving to California I was shocked that I couldn't find Luzianne tea anywhere. Thank goodness for amazon. A 6 pack of 48 bag/boxes may seem like a lot but the boxes are all wrapped and have stayed fresh for me for over a year now. Whenever my friends are over and have tea they all ask how I make it so good, their lipton sun tea just doesn't taste the same!"
1,The only tea bags we use and at this price it sure is nice having it delivered and not running out.  Love the taste!
1,This makes a great iced tea.  Three bags steeped for 3-5 minutes with a teapot of hot water in a gallon container then cut with cold water to make a gallon works for me.
1,"We were a little hesitant going with this brand, but it is fantastic.  The bags are large so you only need to use four of them in a tea maker.  We also make two batches of tea with the same 4 bags and do not notice a difference in taste or potency.  We got this tea about a month ago and are still on the first of the six boxes we received.  I have us set up on the automatic shipment every six months and I think that will plenty of time in between."
1,My son and I drink ice-tea almost constantly through the day (in addition to coffee).  He and I go through about 4+ gallons of tea a week and we have tried many brands.  Luzianne is by far our favorite.
0,I am sorry to say this product does not live up to its positive reviews that are listed.  Lipton makes better ice tea products.  The worst part about this product is you can NOT get a refund or even a credit.  Once you have bought it.... it is yours!  I did not like the taste or brewing instructions. Amazon obviously knows something I didn't about this product......Probably explains why there isn't any recourse......or refund.....
1,"Since we drink so much tea, I buy the best!  It is smooth and never bitter. I always make sure we have it stocked in our pantry."
1,Love the product... Great sweet tea... And easy with the family sized tea bags. You cannot find this tea up north.
1,"This is the best iced tea you can buy, you can't get it up here in Portland Oregon that I have found but getting on Amazon was easy and I have a casr of this great Iced Tea. Should last at least a year."
1,"You can't get better tea than Luzianne.  Tetley, Lipton, Rose Red, etc. don't even compare.  I love the delicious Orange Pekoe/Black Tea blend because it is the perfect combination of fruity and roast flavor.  My family has been buying Luzianne for years.  I just bought a 48 pack of family size tea bags at Walmart tonight and I love how large they are.  I've been drinking almost nothing but tea and water for about a week now because I am trying to wean myself of soda.  It has the perfect amount of caffeine to not cause headaches and it is really good for you -- if you don't sweeten it.  Tea has been shown to prevent cancer and diabetes!  Brew some Luzianne and you'll never look back!<br /><br />Just a helpful tip:<br /><br />I have tried several different brewing methods -- stovetop boiling, microwave boiling, iced tea maker -- but the best one that works is just heating the water until it is hot (not boiling).  I've had problems with it coming out too strong and this is just right.  Let it steep for the full 5 minutes."
1,"I am new to brewing iced tea at home, and I must say, Luzianne tea is fantastic for this very purpose.  The flavor profile is not too robust, but not weak.  It's a perfect balance of black tea that will leave you wanting more!  I use subscribe and save and take advantage of the great price.<br /><br />Some people use home brewers, but they take all the fun out of tea making.  I've adopted the below strategy for the perfect cup of iced tea.<br /><br />Place six cups of tap water in a pot.  Pour 2/3 cup of sugar into the pot, and then bring this simple syrup to a rolling boil, with an occasional stir.  When you reach the rolling boil, steep three of the family sized teabags for about 10 seconds, then remove from heat.  Allow the bags to sit in the pot for 5-10 minutes.  Use a wooden spoon to squeeze any remaining tea out of the bags, and discard.  Allow your tea concentrate to cool to room temperature.  Pour six cups of fresh water into an empty gallon jug (preferably glass, but BPA free plastic works as well).  Then, pour your tea concentrate into the same jug.  You now have delicious iced tea - refrigerate, and serve with ice and a wedge of lemon!  Variations: 1 cup of sugar for southern sweet, 1/4 cup of sugar for sunkissed sweet, or no sugar at all if you like unsweetened tea.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
1,Tastes great - using for Ice Tea. Will also now try the decaf good deal bigger bags are nice nice nice
1,"Luzianne tea makes, in my expert opinion, the best iced tea on the planet. It's a must buy in conjunction with any iced tea maker."
0,"This package of six boxes of forty eight bags per box is listed in the area of large tea bags suitable for making a gallon at a time of tea.  In fact it is just small single use bags.  The box and web page says ""family size"" bags.  There is nothing family sized about single use bags.<br />This is a bad advertisement and you should not buy them.  Read these misleading ads carefully.<br />I hope this company will go out of business."
1,These are amazingly yummy! There are good balances of chocolate and peanut butter and of chewy and crunchy.  And all that and not that bad and maybe even sort of good for you.  Great job!
1,Excellent product and only two weight watcher's plus points...yum!  It's still difficult to find this product in stores so I was pleased to find it on Amazon and cheaper than what I was paying at the grocery.
1,They are tasty and fill you up more than you'd think. Great for staving off hunger or having a little before a meal so you don't overeat. Everything I've tried by Fiber One has been nothing short of delicious and awesome.
1,"I love these bars.  They taste great, have a nice texture, and are very filling--especially considering only 90 calories.  Very difficult to find in stores."
0,Product arrived melted.  Very disappointing.  Would not order again.  Much more costly than instore purchase
1,My 2 miniature schnauzers love these treats and they are just the right size so I  dont have to worry about the fat content as these dogs dont tolerate fat content real well.
1,"I used to be able to get this wonderful marmalade at a neighborhood store, but alas it is no longer available locally. I have looked long and hard before finding a source on (of course) Amazon.  It is pricier than before, and the shipping is significant, but the taste is well worth the expense.  It may well be addictive (perhaps the Malt Whiskey component?). I only hope this company will continue to ship!"
1,"This hot sauce is one of a kind. I am always hesitant to try spicy foods because of the taste of hot sauce.. but when I tried Rocky's I was transformed. Other hot sauces seem chemically to me but Rocky's has a homey flavor that is incredibly diverse-- so much that I have been using it on eggs, tacos, as a marinade for chicken and on grilled cheese!! My family and I have been through six bottles of Rockys in the last two months. I can honestly say this is a first for our family, but certainly not the last as Rocky's has become a staple on the table for every meal. Thank You for creating such an amazing hot sauce and FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT TRIED IT: ORDER NOW!<br /><br />Lime Notes: Zingy with a fresh lime (not that awful concentrated flavor)... It goes perfectly on salad when mixed with some olive oil and chicken with a mexican twist or as a marinade for pork (that's the ways I've tried and loved it)."
1,Tried Rocky's for the first time not too long ago and was really impressed.  Tried countless other brands and nothing comes close to the flavor of Rocky's.  The consistency and taste is perfect for wings.  Most hot sauces are too watery with lacking flavor but Rocky's is exactly where it needs to be!  Highly reccomended!
1,"I was surprised at how plump and sweet they are. These are much better than the drier non-organic red box version. Certainly it is more cost effective to buy them in larger containers such as Newman's organic raisins which are also very good, but this product meets my needs for individual packs, plus they'd be great to give out at Halloween."
1,"The little boxes of organic sweet raisins are just right for a good-for-you snack, or as an addition to cold or hot cereal or to top off a peanut butter sandwich."
1,Loved the product though a bit pricier.<br /><br />The package is excellent and the small packs make a good portable snack available to anyone whenever needed.
1,"These Sun Maid organic raisins are very tasty and moist. I have not found any problems with them and love that the packages are the perfect size for sticking in my purse. I usually combine these raisins with some cashews, almonds, and walnuts or pecans for a quick, nutritious snack or eat in my organic oatmeal for breakfast."
1,"This is a very tasty gluten-free product.  The noodles are comparable to those with gluten and are never mushy.  They also have ""green"" cooking instructions."
1,"We have tried several other GF pastas and this one tops them all.  The whole family loves it!!  Great taste & texture...not mushy, like others."
1,"I was a little nervous at first, trying out this pasta, but it was DIVINE!  I looove this pasta, and have purchased all different varieties/shapes that they have.  Yes, as other person said, do not boil it for the same duration as you're used to boiling regular pasta.  Taste is EXCELLENT, and it's an added plus that they are using rice made in the US, or Can.  One of the two (I believe it was US, but can't remember which one exactly)...I called the company to inquire.  Fantastic product.  If they only made this with organic now..... :)"
1,title says it all. Great exchange for wheat pasta. I prefer it wamr rather than cold in salads. But it is still tasty.
1,"I tried Tinkyada pasta at the urging of my favorite health food store.  I have switched our whole family over to it because it is healthier than regular pasta and it tastes great, even though only one of us needs a gluten free diet.  All of the Tinkyada pastas are great. I recommend to everyone without the slightest reservation.  I buy it by the case so we never run out."
1,"I bought this for my grandson (5) celiac, but we all eat it.  It is absolutely delicious.  Fool you friends and family, it tastes so much like regular wheat pasta.  And it stores wonderfully.  Great product!!"
0,"A friend of mine was sweet enough to buy these for me when she discovered them in a tiny market, and I'm still very grateful to her for being willing to buy them (expensive pasta!) without knowing if they were any good or not.<br /><br />Even my favourite spaghetti sauce could not hide the pasty, wet-dog odour this pasta gives off -- and the ""flavour""? Forget it. Directions followed to a T, but this stuff just isn't worth it. No one at the table liked this stuff. Another disappointing gluten free pasta; don't waste your money."
1,"I cooked these for 16 minutes on medium high and rinsed well after draining. These noodles are thick, squishy, and chewy. That might not be what you're looking for in a pasta noodle, but these reminded me of udon noodles I had before going gluten free. As someone who used to love wheat based udon noodles, Takyada noodles are really great. That's why I still give these 4 stars."
1,"I am allergic to wheat and thought i would die, Italian food was my favortie. All rice pastas are mushy and taste much like health food. This one is far better than all of the rest. The first time I had it, I actually had to check the package to make sure it was Rice and not Wheat. My husband even ate it(without knowing) and didn't notice anything. I would recommend to anyone. It is also half the price on amazon with no shipping so it pays to buy it online. Also, make sure to follow the cooking instructions and rinse very well to get all of the starch off."
1,"Since being diagnosed with Celiac's disease I have had a hard time adjusting to the gluten free lifestyle.  This pasta really helps.  In fact, I like it better than ""regular"" pasta!  And that is high praise as I have not been able to say that I like any gluten free products more than their gluten-filled counter parts (but I haven't tried all the products yet!) This pasta has a creamy, smooth texture. It is wonderful!"
1,"I tried this product out of the blue because I live in Japan and am not able to `shop around`.  I basically hit gold on my first try.  The consistency of this pasta is suprisingly good, and really, it is NOT MUSHY.  Follow the instructions i.e cook for 16 minutes then rinse under the tap.  It comes out perfect every time.  It doesnt have a particular strong taste therefore kids wont be able to tell the difference, I couldn`t either.  For those who need to avoid wheat this is a perfect substitute.  This product comes in a pack of pack of 12, so please bear this in mind when you place your order."
1,"We have tried all kinds of pasta -- quinoa, whole wheat, veggie, etc.  This was the first pasta where my husband and I both liked it and could hardly tell the difference with regular pasta.  We have five kids.  Three out of five can't tell the difference.  One hates all pasta and the other will eat it as long as their is sauce on it.  We make a big batch and reheat in the microwave.  It holds up nicely and doesn't dry out like regular pasta.  Highly recommend if you are looking for an alternative to regular noodles."
1,The tittle says it all. Tinkyada is the best gluten free pasta company in the world. PERIOD. All tinkyada products are exceptional. Their pasta tastes better (by quite a bit) than wheat based pasta. (And I don't have to eat gluten free pasta).
1,"Tinkyada Brown Rice gluten free products are simply some of the best imitations of wheat noodles.  Our one child has gluten sensitivities so we're switched to some alternatives.  Tinkyada is one of the best finds.  The noodles cook over a reasonable length of time (around 15-17 minutes) and have a firm texture and a taste that is quite indistinguishable from regular noodles.  We've enjoyed the noodles with spaghetti, macaroni and cheese, and casseroles.  For texture and taste these cannot be beat for those needing something gluten free due to Celiac disease or other reasons.  Everyone in the family is willing to eat these noodles.  There is a slight taste difference when tried side by side with regular noodles but not pronounced at all unlike the yucky after taste of noodles made from bean flour."
1,Tinkyada makes the best gluten free pasta.  We tried many other brands before this and most were mushy.  This pasta is excellent.  My entire family loves it!
1,"I have tried every brand of GF pasta I can find -- stuff made from corn, rice, quinoa, you name it -- and it all has a funky aftertaste, cooks up poorly, and falls apart if reheated. NOT TINKYADA!! :-) This stuff ROCKS! My hubby is super picky and not GF, but HE LOVES TINKYADA. When I serve it to my gluten-eating friends and family, they take a bite and say, ""oh, too bad you can't eat this..."" SURPRISE! GF doesn't have to mean icky-tasting! :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) There's LOTS more great stuff from Tinkyada you can get here (and prices here beat the other online GF grocers as of 3/2008)."
1,"I didn't think there was a gluten free pasta out there that I'd like.  I'm really picky about taste and texture.  Tinkyada pasta products are superb.  My husband, who does not eat gluten free foods, ate this without noticing the switch.  It's texture remains firm and the taste is good even with just butter and salt!  If you've tried any other GF pasta's and been disappointed, you'll jump for joy with Tinkyada!"
1,"All Tinkyada brand pasta is wonderful, it holds up just like normal pasta, and it flavor and texture are very similar. My family can't tell the difference anymore. You need to watch how long you cook it, don't over cook any gluten free pasta or you get mush. I have tried other gluten free brands and rice pastas, Tinkyada beats them all."
1,Have tried many products this is by far the best Rice Pasta!
1,Tinkyada pasta always cooks well. I am pleased with all their gluten free pastas and I have tried many I truly disliked.
1,"this product is by far the best rice pasta I have ever tried,cooks up al dente and not mushy like some of the rice pasta's"
1,"I've tried several brands of gluten-free pasta, and Tinkyada is my favorite. Good flavor and texture, keeps well in the refrigerator, and heats up well in the microwave.  Just follow the directions on the package, and get great results every time. They also include ""Easy and Energy-Saving Cooking"" instructions (boil for 2 minutes, cover and let sit for 20), which I use during hot weather - the pasta still comes out great, and my kitchen stays cooler. Win-win!"
1,"Best Pasta for Gluten Free there is! It's a huge plus to have this aviliable to order through amazon at 1/2 the cost per package than the markets.  Best tasting gluten free pasta, and great to buy in bulk to save a lot of $$$."
1,"This brand of rice noodles is the most like wheat pasta. It is delicious, the texture is perfect, it doesn't get mushy when it's cooked. I really enjoyed it!"
1,"I am sensitive to wheat and corn, and it's hard to find a wheat-free product that doesn't use corn! So I stumbled upon this at our local health food store and fell in love with it. Even my husband (who has no allergies and is a picky eater) found it to be palatable. He couldn't taste the difference in his favorite ""old world"" recipe. I am so thankful that we found this product AND that we can buy it in bulk through Amazon!"
1,"In my opinion, Tinkyada is the one of the best gluten-free pastas there is. I no loger get anything else. The fettucini is wonderful as well as the spaghetti.<br />If one did not know it was not ""regular"" pasta, they would not tell the difference. It does not get mushy although it takes alittle longer to cook and you need to stir it often so it doesn't get stuck together. I ordered a case of 12 because whenver you have to have a special diet the costs in the health food stores can be outrageous, and this way you get a better price (even with shipping)"
1,"This is a great substitute for regular pasta - doesn't go gummy and taste funny like some brands (I'm lookin' at you, DeBoles).  My significant other and a friend who often eats with us can barely tell the difference in the taste.<br /><br />It's not so great for leftovers, though - unlike regular pasta it doesn't save very well (although it does save better than most gluten free brands I've tried).  Save your leftover sauce separately and boil a new batch of pasta to serve it over."
1,"I highly recommend this to anyone who eats a gluten-free diet. Other than price, it stacks up quite well to wheat spaghetti, though the taste is slightly different. My pasta-loving kids eat it happily and I can enjoy ""spaghetti night"" with them now. The texture is very good with either the normal or energy-saving cooking directions. However, I've found that there are a few things that make a difference in the final quality.<br /><br />First, regardless of which cooking method you use, after you add the pasta to the boiling water, STIR until you're sure all of the noodles are completely separated. If you don't separate them when you first add them to the boiling water, they might stick together and not cook properly. (This is true of wheat spaghetti, too, but the Tinkyada pasta seems a little more prone to it.) After they are all separate, you don't have to stir again if you're using the energy-saving method. With the normal method, I recommend a quick occasional stir to make sure none of the noodles are sticking to the bottom of the pot.<br /><br />Second, don't skimp on the rinsing. You'll see the water goes very cloudy when the pasta cooks - a lot of starch is being released into the water. You have to get that rinsed off or the pasta will stick together after you drain it. If you do the rinsing right, it won't stick together - even leftovers that have been refrigerated won't be sticky.  The cold water rinse seems to be particularly important. Since I like to serve spaghetti noodles hot, I start rinsing with cold water and then finish with hot water. The result is hot spaghetti with no stickiness.<br /><br />Third, unless you're on a low-sodium diet, I recommend salting the cooking water as directed on the package. Salting improves the taste (it's slightly sweet if you don't salt the cooking water) and it also seems to improve the texture slightly.<br /><br />About the energy-saving cooking method: This is great in the summer time since you can turn off the burner sooner and not dump as much heat into the house. But when it's time to rinse you may find that not only is the water very cloudy, but a skin of starch has developed on the surface of the water. It's not pretty, but it rinses right off. (I mentioned this because it freaked my husband out the first time he saw it; I thought I'd save someone else from that surprise.)"
1,"I have heightened sensitivity to touch/texture. It can make enjoying food a little difficult sometimes unless the texture is JUST RIGHT.<br /><br />And this pasta, in my opinion, is great.<br /><br />I cooked it according to the energy-saver directions (where you boil water, place noodles in, cook for a couple minutes and then turn OFF stove, cover and let sit for 20 minutes). The package says it can withstand a lot of overcooking, but they were a TAD mushy when made this way. They were still VERY tasty, despite being a tiny bit too soft. (I would have subtracted 1/2 star for this, but since we can't do that I decided it was still worth the 5 stars)<br /><br />It had a nice flavor too. Slightly sweet and mild, it's best when you salt the water- it balances this out nicely. The price may seem expensive to some, but my husband is very picky about pasta and usually wants us to buy a certain brand that is just about the same price as this stuff- so it's not much of a difference for us.<br /><br />MOST importantly, after eating a fair amount, I did NOT feel ""bloaty"" like I usually do after eating wheat pasta. I felt very satisfied without feeling overfull.<br /><br />I don't know, my husband is one of the pickiest eaters when it comes to pasta and even HE liked it.<br /><br />I think next time I will just cook it a little less. Will definitely be getting this on a regular basis now."
1,This is the only gluten free pasta product that I have eaten (I have eaten most of the pastatutes out there)that tastes like real pasta. Cook it according to the conserving energy method listed on the package as this delivers the best taste and texture.
1,"My family loves pasta and this brand is outstanding.  I have learned to treat any hollow (penne, etc.) pastas gently when I rinse them as they will tear if you shake the colander too vigerously.  Celiacs take note - Tinkyada is the one you have been looking for!  This gluten free product is every bit as good as a wheat product."
1,"This pasta is really tasty and doesn't get so soft that it falls apart, like other ones. The cooking method where you boil it and then turn it off to sit for 20 minutes works best and is so easy!  We also like the twist, lasagna, and macaroni noodles."
1,"When I had to give up gluten I thought that I would never be able to enjoy a great pasta dish again. All the other GF pastas I have tried were gritty, mushy, or just tasted offal, but Tinkyada Brown Rice Spaghetti has a wonderful texture and flavor. My whole family enjoys this pasta."
1,"My husband is wheat-intolerant, and I'm always looking for healthy alternatives. Most of the gluten-free pastas I've tried had been just awful, until a friend recommended the Tinkyada brand. It's easy to cook, and has a taste and texture so close to ordinary pasta that most folks can't tell the difference when it's smothered in pasta sauce. (Some of the pasta shapes -- like the lasagna noodles -- tend to fall apart more easily than their wheat counterparts, but still taste great.)<br /><br />I don't have a problem with wheat or gluten, but I do face a challenge managing my blood cholesterol, and Tinkyada pastas -- made from brown rice with added rice bran for fiber -- are much better for me than ordinary (refined) wheat pastas.<br /><br />The one problem with Tinkyada products is their price. As of now (August 2012), the price for a 16 oz package of spaghetti in our local health food stores is close to $5 USD. I was happy to see the product available in cases of a dozen at a significant discount. It's still pricier than wheat semolina pasta, but much more affordable."
1,I am pleased with the spaghetti.  I am trying to keep away from gluten & it is nice to be able to have spaghetti.
1,I'm Italian and I freaked out about pasta when I was diagnosed with celiac disease. Thankfully I found Tinkyada right away. I have an Italian neighbor and I fed it to him. He said he couldn't tell the difference. It's great stuff.
1,"Best brown rice pasta that I ever tasted! It's not mushy at all as you may concern it may be when it comes to rice pasta. Flavor, taste, texture, and pretty much everything, I prefer this pasta over regular pasta! I don't have any problem with wheat or anything, but I keep buying this pasta after I tried once. Great with any kind of pasta dish, creamy or tomato-based. Totally recommended!"
1,"Perfect texture, and I love that it is made from brown rice!  It makes it that much healthier - I don't feel junky when eating it since I know it is healthier.  Plus it is gluten free!  Perfect for our GF family!"
1,I am not gluten intolerant nor is anyone in my family but we thought we'd try to reduce the amount of gluten in our diets. I tried this pasta not knowing what to expect. We actually tried the white rice version and the brown rice version (in separate dishes) and we LOVED IT. The kids couldn't tell the difference.<br /><br />The one thing I did notice about it is that it is more filling than traditional pasta. So I didn't need as much pasta on my plate to be full (which I also liked). We're switching to this pasta for everything not because we have to but because we love it!
1,I was diagnosed with gluten intolorence 7 months ago and have had fun trying to find all of the gluten things that taste good and have ran across all the things that taste bad untill now! Our family has some kind of pasta atleast once a week and had a melt down when we didnt think it would happen anymore. Finally I was in a health food store and ran across a long time celiac and she told me about this pasta. The entire family loves this pasta including a very picky husband and very picky 4 and 6 year olds. I live in a small town and after many requests the local store started to carry this for me and the local gf group and they cant keep it on the shelves. I have yet to try the other pastas by this company but I trust they will be good to. The sticky issue I never have bacause I usually add plenty of water and a little oil. love this pasta and always have atleast 2 or three packs stowed away in the pantry!
1,"I can't emphasize how happy I am that I found Tinkyada. For years I haven't been able to enjoy pasta without the side effects that gluten sensitivity can bring on. I also searched fruitlessly for a good substitute, but alas everything tasted like something from a different planet. Yech.<br /><br />Then came Tinkyada :) It cooks just like regular wheat pasta, and the texture, taste, consistency is the same. I've made this numerous times for people without telling them that it's gluten-free pasta, and they never suspected a thing (always a fun thing to see their post-meal astonishment).<br /><br />Quick weeknight meals are back again :)"
1,"My attempts to find a healthy alternative to regular pasta were to no avail until I found this ""brown rice"" pasta in the organic section of my local Publix Supermarket. I had already tried ""whole wheat"" pasta and even though I eat, and actually prefer, whole wheat products like pizza and breads, the TEXTURE of the spaghetti was awful. I found whole wheat egg noodles and that was better, but I missed the look and twirl of spaghetti. I saw this; I like brown rice, it's organic, it looked edible as I measured it up in my mind and, alright, I put it into my shopping cart. I followed the instructions and boiled it for 16 minutes. I rinsed it well with cold water and added it to a large hot frying pan which had olive oil. After mixing for a minute and a half, I added Lucini  brand marinara and mixed it, covered it and, when hot, ate it. My review, excellent; be proud to serve and not have to apologize that it's healthy.<br />Like that old TV commercial used to say, ""Try It, You'll Like It."""
1,"Three of my four children have been diagnosed with Celiac Disease.  Over the years, we have tried many different gluten-free pastas.  Tinkayada is the absolute best we have tried.  The taste and texture is fantastic. I recommend this pasta to anyone who must be on a gluten-free diet."
1,I have yet to find a noodle by Tinkyada that wasn't really good.  The flavor doesn't collide with or overpower the foods you serve with them.  Other GF noodles have fallen apart but not these.  Don't be alarmed the cooking water goes cloudy but the noodles are great.
1,"I've tried several rice pastas since eliminating gluten from my diet. This is by far the best pasta! It tastes just like the ""real"" pasta and it doesn't turn gooey on me like many of the other rice pastas. My family cannot believe it's rice past and I like that I can get the brown rice variety versus the white."
1,"Tinkyada brand is hands down the best GF pasta around.  I hear Biaglut is also good, I have not tried that one, and I hear it is much more expensive then Tinkyada.  So I will stick with this one!! I love it!!"
1,These are good!  One of my Celiac children rated it better than corn pasta and one didn't.  The consistancy reminds me a little of spagettio's.  I will probably alternate between these and corn based pasta.
1,"Finally a gluten free spaghetti that is just as good, if not better, than wheat spaghetti. I tried soybean spaghetti but it doesn't taste like spaghetti to me, and the flavor doesn't mingle well with spaghetti sauce. I love Tinkyada Brown Rice elbows as well."
1,"I've known about my celiac disease for over 25 years, tried many brands and varieties of gluten free pasta, and Tinkyada - hands down - has the best in this variety and all others they make.  It's not particularly sticky, and very much like ""regular"" semolina pasta in texture.  The taste is excellent.  My (non-celiac) wife loves it!  She doesn't even bother making two different pots of pasta anymore because she finally found one of ""my"" pastas that was quite satisfactory for her too.  I don't feel like I'm giving up ANYthing with Tinkyada's products over what I used to to eat in my ""BC"" (Before Celiac) days.<br /><br />One other nice feature is the price.  It seems to be a bit more expensive than some other gluten free pasta products, but compare the price AND the weight.  Once both are taken into consideration, I've found that Tinkyada doesn't cost much if any more than the much less desirable brands of gluten free pasta, and it's often less expensive.  This truly earns 5 stars, and I try to reserve that for the best of the best."
1,"This spaghetti is the best ever.... it is even tastier than wheat varieties....<br />It does not get gummy like regular wheat spaghetti...<br />Even if I were not gluten intolerant, I would choose it over wheat spaghetti.  It is that good.  I love it!!!!"
1,"My husband got us this since we are avid eaters of brown rice. We love it. The secret is that it is closer to whole wheat pasta, and it does not stick together to form a big noodle bundle! If you are into wheat-free stuff, this is just for you."
1,"My husband, who doesn't have to eat gluten-free, loves this spaghetti. Other than an awesome flavor and texture, it reheats very well, allowing leftovers to save money."
0,"Honestly, I cant understand why this pasta gets such high marks.  I tried it and it is nowhere close to normal pasta.<br /><br />Since being told I have to be gluten free, finding a good pasta substitute has been difficult.<br />All these rice pasta brands are glue-y, sticky and slimey in texture.  this one is a little less so but it still has that wierd slimy, sticky quality.  the rice noodles are pasty colored too.  not appetizing at all.  And all this gluten free marketed stuff is hideously expensive so trying all the different brands gets costly.<br /><br />I have found the quinoa+corn based noodles to be the closest thing to real pasta -- The texture is much better.  I'm still trying to find something I can live with but so far, the quinoa pasta seems to be the most acceptable."
1,All Tinkyada brown rice pasta products have been wonderful!  You do need to learn not to overcook them.  I find using the energy saving technique (boil a minute or two and then cover pot and wait about 15 minutes) works perfectly.  We love this pasta and find it better than the pasta we ate before our gluten free days.
0,"Based on reviews, I tried this pasta. It may have been better than some other brands, but it certainly didn't taste good. The only gluten-free pasta that I think tastes like ""real"" pasta is made by Bionature--both their penne and their spaghetti are terrific."
1,"This deal is the best deal I can find for this name of pasta.  I'm trying gluten free, and this fits easily into the budget.  Taste great or better than regular (wheat) pasta."
1,This is our go-to pasta.  It is easy to cook (definately try the energy saving method).  The price is reasonable and leftovers keep well in the fridge without breaking down.
0,"I bought this thinking it would be nice to eat a spaghetti that was gluten free and not expensive. I bought a few packages because I always follow the package directions first, then I play with it if it's not to my liking.<br /><br />Attempt 1 was like eating a gummy spaghetti noodle with a nasty after taste. I had to add sauce and butter to kill the taste.<br /><br />Attempt 2 wasn't any better. It was still gummy and gluey like and the flavor wasn't very good either.<br /><br />Attempt 3 was a little better in that the water didn't look like a gelatin style mess when we drained it but the noodles were chewy and I couldn't finish the second bite.<br /><br />Attempt 4 was when I finally said no more ""pasta joy"". I ended up trying to cook it by breaking the noodles in half first, thinking maybe it just isn't that great for cooking as long noodles. Oh no. I ended up having to take out clumps of noodles, tear them apart from each other and put them back in the pot. I gave up towards the end and just threw the clumps of noodles out. The texture was slimy, gummy and sticky and the aftertaste is still like pet food.<br /><br />If you are used to over cooked spaghetti drowned in sauce, I could see how this would be great... But if you want something that tastes and acts like spaghetti, this is NOT it.<br /><br />I can't figure out how this got 5 stars. It was horrible in taste and texture and was nothing close to spaghetti. I bought Hodgkins Mills rice and flaxseed noodles and they are perfect in texture and taste. But I won't buy pasta joy again."
1,I have been eating this pasta for years.  I think it's the best in terms of taste and texture.  You can't beat this price.  Excellent value.
1,"This stuff takes awhile to ccok, but it doesn't turn to mush when you cook it! Holds up really well in soups, slow cooker meals and pasta main dishes (both hot and cold). Nice flavor, too.<br /><br />Before I ate gluten-free, I used to eat 100% whole wheat pasta. This is nowhere near as flavorful (and is softer in texture), but I've gotten used to it. If you like white/refined/semolina wheat pasta, there will be less adjusting to do (regarding taste.) This pasta definitely has more flavor than white rice pastas, and it really does hold up much better in cooking."
1,"I've been eating this pasta for at least 12 years- no other GF pasta compares to this one! I do salt the water, put the pasta in when the water's boiling, and I always have to cook it for a few minutes longer than recommended. Afterwards, I rinse in cool water. I like that it is somewhat nutritious because of the rice bran and brown rice. I also like the taste and the consistency of the pasta. It is quite filling, but I've found this to be true of all GF pastas."
1,Have brought this pasta to dinners and people just think it's whole wheat pasta. My husband and I really like it.
1,This is the best pasta we've tried.  Add more water to the pot because it's a bit starchier than regular pasta.
1,This is the best rice pasta I ever had and enjoy every week now that I have found what will be a staple in our home.
1,After trying many different kinds of pasta....this is almost as good as the wheat pasta that I have used for years....
1,"This pasta is so authentic no one in my family could believe it wasn't wheat.  We were buying the Tinkyada white rice pasta and, while it was pretty good, it didn't quite have the same taste & texture as a wheat-based pasta.  This one is great.  The price on Amazon, by the case, is much cheaper than in local stores, esp. with super saver shipping.<br /><br />Can't say enough about how great this pasta is.  If you are gluten free and have to serve pasta to family members or friends that you can eat, this is your best bet."
1,"This company makes the BEST non-wheat-based pasta I have tried! Taste, texture, the way it holds up and everything considered. The only one I've had trouble with was the lasagna - it broke. But that may have been the way I was treating it. I have not been able to enjoy pasta for a while now,... until I found Tinkiyada. MMMM... macaroni and cheese! Spaghetti and meatballs! Didn't know I missed them so much."
1,"I have been gluten free for over 2 years, and I've tried many types of gluten free spaghettis, and this is the best by far. It has the best texture and flavor. It sometimes sticks a bit, but if you put a little olive oil on it before you boil it, and add a bit to the water then it doesn't stick at all."
1,For those looking for a delicious brown rice pasta Tinkyada is the best.  I've tried just about every brand and Tinkyada is the best.  My family loves it.  We choose to eat this pasta as opposed to wheat pasta to be healthier.  It cooks up good.  And buying from Amazon is great.  We can buy large quantities at a substantial discount.
1,"We tried this pasta on a whim when grocery shopping one day.  No one in our family eats a gluten-free diet or anything, it was purely an impulse buy.  Wow- was this a good purchase!  I fed our whole family (6 including 3 teenagers) with this one bag and we had a lot leftover.  It is of such high quality that it filled everyone up on less than traditional white pasta AND they couldn't stop talking about how good it taste!  I used this brand's mini-shells for a dish a few nights ago and again- THEY COULDN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT HOW GOOD IT WAS!! This will now be our pasta of choice as the flavor and value (because less fills up everyone)from now on!  Can't say enough!"
1,"I really like this product especially since I can't have wheat. The flavor and texture are great. One word to note though is you should eat it the same same day you make it. It holds it's texture better that way. Otherwise it tends to brake down into smaller pieces the next day. Also, I found the best way to cook this is by boiling it for two minutes and then letting it sit in the hot water with a cover for 15-20 minutes (depending on how you may like the texture to be). This seems to be a fail proof way of making it. I found if you boil it for the whole 15-20 minutes it has a tendency to become mushy and breaks apart easier. Otherwise it a very good alternative to wheat spaghetti."
1,"Tankyada spaghettis are first quality. My husband has celiac disease and has to eat a gluten free diet, which can be a real pain. We have purchased other brands of pasta before. They turned into mush and were very sticky.<br />So we purchased Tankyada spaghettis from Amamzon, and we are thrilled.<br />They don't stick together and are easy to serve, if one follows the directions. My advice is: If there are leftovers, please, rinse them in cold water again, drain and store in the refrigerator.<br />I hope my review will help others."
1,"This pasta takes about 20 minutes to cook but it is delicious, firm, gluten free and hard to mess up!"
1,"This pasta has a great taste and texture.  It is very similar to ""regular"" pasta.  My husband, who does not have celiac, enjoys it too."
1,"This tastes better than spaghetti that is made with wheat.  Gluten free is more expensive, but I got this at a good price.  Will buy more when I am finished with this."
1,"YES, you can have yummy pasta!!Love, love ,love it!! just remember to boil it in lots of water then rinse it when it is done to your liking. No one even guessed that it was not regular pasta in my house. I am so glad it is here so that I can get a better deal as it is well worth it in my opinion. To use leftover pasta drop into boiling water quickly and strain and its ready for another meal. The rotini is great too but I have not tried any others from this brand yet. Enjoy"
1,Great pasta. Tastes the same as regular pasta if not better. I really like it!
1,"I've started buying this in bulk from Amazon because it seems to be the only GF pasta that works.  Others fall apart or are simply awfultasting in addition to being overpriced. I have to keep telling my mother in law not to buy the little $4 a bag GF pasta she buys because I've found the one that works.  If you follow the ""energy saving"" method, it works even better.  That way the pasta isn't torn up by all the boiling."
1,"Tinkyada is the best brand for gluten-free pasta we have found so far - and I'm not inclined to keep looking, it's that good!  It's made of rice and bran, instead of wheat, so of course it will taste differently, and cook differently, than what some people are used to when they first switch over to wheat-free, but it's thoroughly delicious.  Also, let me say again that it is (hands down) the best brand we've found for gluten-free pastas!"
1,"I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease in Dec. 09.  I have tried a lot of different rice noodles.  This brand is by far the best I have tried.  They are not gummy or sticky like others!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FK63IS"">Tinkyada Brown Rice Spaghetti with Rice Bran, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>"
1,"This is the best gluten free pasta brand I've ever found on the market, I buy this in bulk every 6 months on schedule, and I recommend it highly!"
1,"Since I developed a wheat allergy I've tried every gluten-free pasta out there. Most are gross- they either have a strange taste of corn or beans or they get mushy or have some other weird texture. The leftovers have a tendency to turn to a weird sort of paste. Yuck!<br /><br />This stuff, however, is fantastic! You must follow the directions correctly but if you do it has a great texture that is close to regular pasta. While the flavor is obviously slightly different than regular pasta I've served it to people with a properly seasoned sauce who said it was better than regular pasta. It holds up, covered in sauce, as well for leftovers as regular pasta.<br /><br />I especially love the spaghetti with a homemade marinara sauce and the lasagna noodles made in the best lasagna recipe EVER [...] though I alter the recipe a bit by making extra sauce, baking a little longer, and don't bother pre-cooking the noodles.<br /><br />I'm LOVING that I can buy in bulk from Amazon, at a much cheaper price than my local health food store."
1,"After being diagnosed with Celiac, I tried many, many brands of pasta. They were all a disappointment. Grainy, squishy, and if they even got slightly cool they'd harden up. Or they'd just fall apart in the pot if they weren't carefully watched.<br />Then an online friend recommended Tinkyada.<br />I bought a package. Just one. I figured it couldn't hurt to try it. My non GF'ers in the house couldn't even tell the difference from their regular pasta. The taste, texture, and ability to be al dente unlike most other GF pasta's makes this pasta the King of All GF Pasta's in my house. We've tried all the various pasta's that Tinkyada makes by this point and not a single one has disappointed us.<br />The ONLY con to this pasta is if you don't use it all at once, and refrigerate it for later. It tends to get stiff and grainy feeling. However, my 15 yo GF daughter microwaves the pasta for a couple minutes with about a TB of water and then puts them in a microwave safe dish to take to school for lunch. Just those few minutes with some extra water fixes the issue no problems.<br /><br />All in all, I definitely recommend this pasta to anyone struggling with a gluten-free diet. This pasta absolutely replaces all gluten containing pasta's, especially with how very many varieties Tinkyada makes! No more feeling sorry for yourself or your child with yucky pasta."
1,I've been gluten free for almost 20 years and a cook forever but since I discovered the Tinkyada pastas I'm actually having fun making pasta again. This summer I treated guests from out of town to a picnic featuring pasta salad - no one guessed the dish was gluten free. I've made mac and cheese to die for! And spaghetti? Wow! Don't get me started. Don't know how they do it but this stuff beats the heck out of any gluten free pasta I've ever used. Was ready to order a couple of cases from the factory in Canada until I discovered I could order it on Amazon.
1,"The only difference between this brand and ""regular"" noodles is the cooking time. I made these terrified they would be awful, and delighted that my husband actually liked it more than regular pasta. (He doesn't have to be gluten free, so if he likes it, that's a good thing!)<br /><br />When you're cooking these, you'll notice the water gets really white, so be sure you rinse it off and they do tend to take a little longer to cook than traditional wheat pastas. When you think they are done, take a bite of them to make sure they're not too ""al dente"". Once they are cooked, they have the exact same color and texture you'd expect.<br /><br />The price here is pretty good, especially if you have to travel a distance to find them near you - if 12 is too many, split the case with a gluten free friend or two."
1,"Tinkyada makes the best gluten free pasta. It's relatively inexpensive, takes the same amount of prep as any other pasta, and typically people won't notice the difference between this and conventional pasta. Make sure you add a splash of olive oil before boiling the water to prevent sticking. Also, stirring frequently prevents the pasta from sticking together, too. All of Tinkyada's varieties of pastas are great, even the stuffed shells and lasagna."
1,"My family has been on the gluten-free diet for the past nine years. I have spent literally hundreds of dollars trying out various brands of wheat/gluten free pasta - that have generally ended up in the trash. I even quit trying to find a good substitute for a long time. UNTIL a friend suggested I try this brand. I was skeptical, but it tasted great. It won the approval of every member of the household, even my husband who isn't gluten intolerant.<br /><br />I have tried 6 shapes of the pasta and they have all been consistently good. I can make spaghetti, mac & cheese, casseroles, lasagna and all of the other foods we used to enjoy before going GF. I follow the cooking times listed on the package, and I have never had a problem with mushiness, or the pasta being undercooked in the center. If I am going to bake the pasta after I've boiled it, I cut down on the boil time by 2-3 minutes. There is NO CORN in this pasta, so if that is  concern for you - know that you can purchase this!<br /><br />I really do love these pastas and I hope your family will too!"
1,I only use pasta products made by Tinkyada. The pasta always comes out perfectly and non-celiac people can't tell the difference. I've used the spiral pastas for my veggie pasta salads and they turn out great. I eat Tinkyada pasta every week!
1,Tinkyada makes the best gluten free pasta I have ever tried.  It cooks up great and my whole family loves it.  The Lasagna and Penne are equally good.
1,"We adore all of Tinkyada's products, their pasta keeps it's shape far better than any other pasta rice product we have tried. Friends are never able to tell it isn't a traditional pasta product. I served a cold Rotini salad made with Tinkyada pasta at our BBQ last night and no one knew it was Gluten Free, they all said it was delicious. A guest who was also on a Gluten Free diet said she couldn't believe it was really GF - she has been so disappointed with other rice pastas and was happy I'd discovered the Tinkyada line of products."
1,"As one who suffers with gluten and wheat sensitivities, this product was just what the doctor ordered. I love it. I make lots of dishes with this  brown rice pasta, spaghetti style. It works great when making spaghetti, pasta with shrimp. Keep up the good work, you've got a customer who's very satisfied."
1,"Being gluten free can be a challange to find products that can be fun to eat not just a substitute that reminds you that you are being deprived of what everyone else eats. So far, (and I have tried several) Tinkyada is the only GF pasta that I have found that is close in texture and fun as wheat spaghetti and I am including other pasta shapes in this review. My husband even likes it and I have served GF pasta with chicken and sauce over it to guests and they were suprised it was GF. It doesn't bloat you like wheat pasta. You just feel comforatbly full after a big wad of ""sketti"". One downside of any of the GF pastas is that they are stiff and breakable when cold so it is hard to use them for cold pasta salad. However, I had some that I had overcooked a little and that seemed to work pretty well for cold salad. You will have to experiment for yourself with that. At any rate, I would definitely suggest you try the spaghetti especially if you have a child who is gluten free. Also the pasta will make great mac and cheese."
1,"This pasta is delicious, the best I have ever eaten and I highly recommend it.  I would like to see Amazon stock all the different types of pasta that this company makes.  I would order some of all."
1,This pasta is GOOD!  You really can't tell much difference from wheat.  I was surprised.  I'm fairly new to the world of gluten free eating and have not been won over by products other people say are tasty.  My taste buds haven't become accustomed to many years of wheat free living yet but they gave this product two thumbs up!
1,"My grandchildren LOVE the sour gummy vitamins. They really liked the sour gummy worms by Rhino, but alas, I can't find them. These were a good second choice. The big problem is keeping them from eating more than 2!"
1,WHO WOULD SPEND<br />Price: $53.34 FOR ONE BAG! WHEN YOU CAN GET A CASE FOR LESS!! BEST OF LUCK TO YOU ALL
1,"Product was exactly as advertised.  It arrived in a timely manner in excellent condition.<br />The taste is spot on.  I put a few drops of the pure maple extract, along with a couple of drops of pure vanilla extract in my oatmeal (with 1/4 chopped walnuts) every morning.  It's a great way to start the day. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004QQA4KK/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
1,"We go through a lot of syrup in our house and I was concerned about the corn syrup.  When I searched the local stores for maple extract, all I could find was imitation.  We are now on our second bottle of Cook's and it works perfectly for what I wanted.  The only complaint I have is the price and shipping are a bit expensive.  Other than that, the product is great."
1,"Finally no spinach!  This is a great tasting pasta.  Instead of spinach it has the full flavor of basil.  With a sauce or just some grated cheese on top, it is a wonderful addition to any meal.  I serve it weekly."
1,"Great tasting pasta that is easy to make. Cooks fast, excellent texture, and can be used in many pasta dishes."
1,"Excellent product. It takes 3 minutes to prepare and has a wonderful flavor. No sauce is even necessary,a little butter or olive oil maybe a little garlic - wonderful."
1,"This is one of my favorite Indian sweets & this brand is as close to a homemade taste as you can get without making it yourself. For Americans unfamiliar with Indian sweets, the best analogy I can give you for soan papdi is that it tastes & feels similar to the inside of a very soft, very fresh Butterfinger... except the nuts used for flavoring are pistachio and almond instead of peanut. It also has about 1/10 the calories and melts in your mouth. Loooove it!"
1,I was introduced to this by a co-worker and I couldn't get enough!! I never knew these sweets existed.  Delicious!
1,"The company gets a 5 star for rapid fast shipping and great customer service! The product gets a 5 star for the flavor. I can get addicted to this brand of Soan Papdi! If you are ""new"" to Indian Sweets and like the inside of a Butterfinger Candy bar, than you will love this. Not too sweet, and yet crispity, crunchity, delicately sweet with complex flavors of heaven!<br />I will for sure be ordering this regularly.<br />Warmly,<br />Jackie"
1,"Love, love, love this coffee!  It is the perfect roast for breakfast.  If it's not good coffee I won't drink it.  And I love this one."
1,This product is a great value for the money.  A great way to sample these coffees and share with friends!
0,"I bought 10 lbs of belly flops a while back and those were so good and very sweet.  These jelly beans or not as sweet nor tasty. There seems to be a lot more root beer beans than any other ones.  They did not come in bags just a box of jelly beans.  The value was very good for the money, but in the future I'm only going to stick to flops."
1,"My pug-chihuahua has learned that the only time she gets a treat is after a bath and nail trim. After she's dried off, she runs to the kitchen and stares at the basket where I keep the Greenies - she knows she's owed a reward! She loves Greenies and I was happy to discover this Lite version. She seems to enjoy them as much as the regular version, and this is a much more economical way to have them on hand rather than buying them at the vet for a dollar apiece!"
1,My dog loves them. I give her one when I leave for work. She not only enjoys the treat but it cleans her teath and keeps her busy so she doesn't notice my leaving as much.
1,"Mollie, my Aussie Shepherd mix, loves Greenies.  And I like that the lite is better for her--even though she is an active dog.  We've not had any problems with her chewing or digesting them--as others have.  She loves the taste, but eats them slowly enough to make the bits small pieces.  And I value how they clean her teeth.  All in all, we love them, but I watch her while she eats; I wouldn't put them in her kennel while I was away."
0,It doesn't really clean up the smell from my dogs' mouths. They love Greenies so much because Greenies got by-products in the ingredients which taste really good but doesn't do good job for the breath. I would recommend Halo's dental chew than Greenies.
1,"Greenies were recommended to me by a friend, and I love them for my dogs!  Greenies really help with bad breath!  My dogs LOVE THEM!"
1,"I use a ton of ""greenies"" or other dental products for my little dog (a 7 lb Yorkie/Maltese mix.)  She used to hate it when I left the house, so I started giving her the regular greenies as a special treat for departures only.  However, she was started to get a little chunky, so thought switching her to the ""light"" version  might be a better option.  I was initially worried because she has an insanely sensitive digestive system, but I've seen no problem thus far, and I've been using them for over a week.  She doesn't seem to notice a difference at all, and I feel comfortable knowing I'm not overfeeding her (in order to assuage my guilt for leaving in the first place!) I would definitely recommend this product."
1,"We have two yorkies, one is very picky and one whom we nicknamed a porkie yorkie will eat anything.<br />They both love these. We do not give them one everyday, because we like to give them variety. We do treat them like our kids. The Lite is for the tubby little one, she is 4 and the picky one is 12. They are so spoiled that we have at least 10 different treats for them to keep them happy. And boy it is hard to find treats made in USA!  We have been giving our babies these treats since our 12 year old was a puppy, the vet says she has the best teeth of any 12 year old yorkie she has ever seen. The little one is no slouch either.<br />But Yorkies are nortorious for getting bad teeth. Not ours. They love the greenies and the teenie lites are perfect for their after our dinner treats. And made in America. How much better can you get then that? Your pets are important, treat them  to a greenie!"
1,"My dog absolutely LOVES greenies!!! Started him out on regular ones, but because I give him two a day, I buy the smallest ones in the ""lite"" version and give him one in the morning as a reward for ""doing his business"" and going back inside when I ask (it helps that he knows he'll get one if he goes inside) and one at night, once again, for going back inside. I keep them in the freezer and he loves them cold. It makes me happy that these will help with his dental care. Its fun to see him get so excited! LOL."
1,a gift for my daughters spaniel.  My daughter swears by this product and will use no other.  would definatly recorder
1,I received the tea a lot quicker than I thought I would. I will be ordering it again because it is very good tea.
1,"This tea is overpriced. At asian markets, retail is $6.95. Certainly, wholesale is drastically less. The price asked for here is appalling. It's the exact same tea and Foojoy is considered one of the lesser brands in teas. The product is great, the seller? Doubtful."
1,Not a bad tasting tea!! And actually does seem to help with appetite suppressing. Good value for money.
1,"This stuff is great!  I was nervous about the taste at first, but it's awesome!  I put a teaspoon of honey and a teaspoon of Splenda sugar Blend in it and it is just yummy!  Thank you for your fast delivery too!"
1,This is the only tea that I will drink.  It has an amazing taste.  I have been ordering this product for some time and can always rely on value as well as the flavor.
1,Love the tea it helps with my hunger pains and my metabolism Would recommend this to everyone .  Thank You
0,I have purchased this tea before and just love it but my latest purchase have inferior bags.  They break no matter how carefully you place them into the hot water or pour over.  The former bags were not the flow thru type and never broke.  These flow thru bags are very thin and cheaply made.  The tea still tastes great.
1,This tasted fine but I didn't really see any weight loss. I liked the tea tho. Maybe I just didn't drink enough to benefit from the weight loss.
1,"I'm kind of an amateur when it comes to tea, but I've tried several kinds of oolong tea, mostly because of the supposed visceral fat-burning benefits.  [I can't really comment on the fat burning because I'm also dieting and exercising.]  But I can comment on the flavor of the tea.  I use one tea bag in an insulated mug of about 14 ounces, add a heaping teaspoon of Splenda, and leave it in the mug as I drink it over two to three hours.  Probably not the best way to drink tea, I know. Nevertheless, this tea has a good, moderately strong, pleasant flavor; holds its flavor; and does not have a bitter aftertaste like some of the others I have tried.  Best of all, this was very economical [$7 for a hundred bags, and eligible for free Prime shipping].  I highly recommend this tea and plan to buy it again.  Do watch to make certain it is specifically this brand and kind, since Foojoy has several that sound similar and I have tried one of the others that I did not like as well.  [...]"
0,"Most of the bags were broken and unusable... however, I eventually found a good bag and brewed some of this tea, and it was dreadful. It has tons of floating powder in it, and really sticks in your throat. The flavor is bitter and acrid, and nothing like what I have ever had in any Chinese restaurant. It's truly awful."
1,"I like it. I drink at least 1 or 2 everyday. You have to get used to the flavor though, since it's kind of bitter. I find it a much better option to keep you awake than coffee."
0,"I usually do not leave negative reviews. But I was so excited to order this tea at such a good price. I ordered two boxes. One for me and another for my friend. Well, I would just like to say that this was the worst experience I ever had with an online order. I ordered two boxes of this tea and only received one. Then I got one box of the tea, me thinking this is weired. I sent an email to the company. I had to wait at least 2 1/2 weeks to get a response from my email. Granted, the owner emailed me back and said he was out of the country and did apologize. His wife was helping him. The thing is, if the help is not good or don't know what they are doing. It is like leaving your business on auto pilot and hoping nothing goes wrong! Well it did, things went terribly wrong! I did not even try the tea. The box I did get I just put it to the side. The owner did refund my money for the one box I never got, I thank you for that to say the least. But over all next time please do not leave you business unmanned. The results are not good at all!"
0,I have been drinking Costa Rican Coffee for years. What came out of this bag was too bland to be Costa Rican.. Or maybe just too old.
0,"Sorry to say I was disappointed with this coffee.  Costa Rican is one of my favorites and I guess I should have known better than to buy already ground, but they were out of whole bean so I thought what the heck!  When I opened the bag and hardly smelled any aroma I had my first clue something was amiss...then when my husband said it tasted like swill...that sealed the deal.  Can't recommend"
0,"I ordered this on 7/30/12. It came on 8/25/12 (not super fast, but not unreasonable coming from India). I wanted to be excited to get this product, but was initially worried about my cardamom because the small cardboard box was very warped and appeared as though it had gotten quite wet at some point. I hoped that the product inside had been packaged in a way that allowed it to remain dry. Boy was I disappointed (I've bought on amazon for years, and this is my very first review. Yep, I'm that unhappy). I cut the tape and looked inside. All of the pods were loose inside the box! They were not contained in any protective covering whatsoever. I removed the pods from the box and did locate a split plastic ziploc bag. Nothing else. It appeared as though it had no hope of keeping my product safe through the shipping process, and not just because of the split in the bag. Nope. It also was completely unsealed. I took pictures but there is no way for me to attach them to this review. The cardamom smelled musty, and I had to throw it away. I was very disappointed. I know accidents can happen, but placing my cardamom into a low quality plastic bag, failing to seal it, and tossing it into a cardboard box just doesn't cut it. This is a poor practice when shipping from so far. I cannot tell if the cardamom would have been fresh otherwise, I will not order again."
1,"This black type of cardamom is impossible to find in local stores, which otherwise offer nearly all the spices used in South Asian cooking. It is essential to certain recipes.<br />It arrived faster than promised in an airtight bag within a sturdy box; this resulted in fresh product delivered to our house. The price was reasonable."
1,My wife and I really like this Green Tea.  It is the only<br />Green Tea that we like to drink.  We often mix it with other<br />flavors like Apple Spice.
0,I purchased these and once home ate them and experienced a severe gluten reaction.  On the bag in small print at the bottom it said they were manufactured in a facility with wheat and dairy.  The label also stated that routine testing occurs only to maintain gluten free label status.  Our bag tested positive for gluten which caused severe bleeding.<br /><br />Please be careful when buying this brand as the statement is for CYA and labeling purposes only.  That way they can charge more for the product.
1,"My daughter and I both have celiac and these are my favorite gluten-free cookies. I loved ginger snaps and molasses cookies before I was diagnosed with celiac and this are a lovely indulgence in a sparce market. I dip them in milk, my daughter eats them plain. Good texture too!"
1,"This sandwich cookie is crisp, not too sweet and delicious with a cup of coffee or tea.  Really satisfies the craving for something to dip into your coffee."
1,"Out of all their different kinds of cookies, this is the one that rocks.<br /><br />You would never know this was gluten free."
1,We know a lot about GF producs in my house and my son really likes these cookies.  They are good Oreo substitutes.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the cookie part is very hard and brittle.
1,"My 5 yr. old son (Tyler) who is Autistic and had to go on the GF diet likes them very much. I found these cookies at Liz' Healthfood in Conway, AR. They taste almost like an Oreo. Great cookie."
1,"I keep these in the house at all times.  They are a fabulous cookie- nice taste, not hard or crumbly.  I also use them as a pie crust.  I put them in the blender to chop them up, then mix in a bowl with melted butter.  I spray my pie dish with non-stick spray before pressing it in the plate.  My family likes it as a crust for chocolate pie, but I've used them with others also and it turns out great.  I've never used them for baking pies so I can't recommend that, only for no-bake pies, cheesecakes, etc."
1,"I like all the gluten free flavors of cookies that Mi-Del makes.  These are a perfect ginger snap.  Yes, they are crunchy and spicy, but that is what I expect in a ginger snap.  They are wonderful to dip in milk.  The milk cools the spiciness and softens the cookie.  My kids like them so much I have to hide them if I want some left for later!"
1,These are the best gluten free cookies ever.  If you have had the real thing before you won't know the difference.  Even my friends that aren't allergic to gluten like these cookies.
0,The outer layer of the cookie is good but the center is far from creamy. It's rock hard and inedible IMO. I bought these and after eating a couple they sat in our pantry until they went stale and were tossed. I won't buy these again. However MI-DEL makes other cookie varieties that are delicious--my whole family loves the GF arrowroot animal cookies and the GF ginger snaps.
0,"These cookies are cloyingly sweet, i had to throw out the middle as it tasted like sugar! The cookies themselves are hard without much flavor. I wouldn't buy them again. I'm wondering what to do with those that are left."
1,"Not only will these cookies satisfy a ""sweet tooth"" attack, but they're healthy and will calm nausea and/or upset stomach.  Strong ginger flavor, not sugary, so although adults really like them, a lot of kids probably won't be crazy about them."
1,"These are some of the best mass-produced gluten-free cookies I have found.  (Never mind the gluten-free part -- most people could never tell that these ginger snaps are not made with wheat flour.)  They've got great snap and just the right amount of gingery heat.  When crushed and combined with a few other choice ingredients, they make a fantastic pie or dessert crust.<br /><br />So why only four stars?  Well, I've bought these ginger snaps many times at the grocery store, and never have I had so many broken cookies as in the box that Amazon sent.  The box itself showed no signs of damage, so I'm a bit puzzled as to what transpired in the Amazon warehouse or in transit.  All in all, however, I love the cookies and am pleased with the Amazon price.  I'll be ordering these again."
0,"Hard as a rock.  Some companies are able to make gluten free sweets palatable, but these are really not very good.  Soaked a cookie in milk for 5 minutes and it did not soften."
1,yummy! these are amazing. thanks midel for making delicious gluten free cookies. these melt in your mouth. most gluten free foods taste like cardboard but these are very tastey. i'm hooked....
1,"Found out I gotta go gluten to due to nursing a gluten intolerant baby , I love my gluten desserts so I have to have something good to eat. These Ginger snaps dipped in almond milk are soooo good mmmmmm mmmmm : )"
1,"I haven't been gluten-free my whole life, and Oreos were a common dessert item I used to have. These cookies are very similar in flavor, although the cream filling is a bit more crumbly. These do have corn and soy products in them, which I'm not fond of, but as an occasional treat isn't too horrid."
1,"I have been buying this cookies for a long time now, and enjoy them very much.  They taste great - as good as oreo cookies.  LOVE THEM, and will continue to buy them.  I recommend them highly to anyone who must eat Gluten-Free."
0,"We buy this type of product because of a health condition. We ordered these cookies fully expecting them to arrive in a some what good condition. Instead all we received was crumbs and partial cookies, there were very few whole cookies. I suspect the lack of care in the packaging was one of the main problems."
0,"I am a huge fan of ginger snaps. When recently diagnosed as needing to be gluten-free, and recently pregnant, I've been on the hunt for GF ginger snaps. I've tried three:<br /><br />Mi-Del Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br />Annie's Homegrown Ginger Snap Gluten Free Bunny Cookies<br />Mary's Gone Crackers Love Cookies Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br /><br />1. Mi-Del<br />Texture: a bit grainy. Crunchy, but crumbles in the mouth in that gluten-free grainy way that is not my favorite texture<br />Ginger flavor: middling, a tiny bit spicy on the tongue but not too much<br />Sweetness: sweet, like you'd expect a cookie to be<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick<br />Density: the most heavy or dense of the three<br />Overall 2 or 3 out of 5 stars<br /><br />2. Annie's<br />Texture: a bit grainy, but less so than Mi-Del. Very crunchy. Little goldfish-sized crackers perfect for kids or snacking.<br />Ginger flavor: the most mild of the three, has that gingery hint to it, but not enough where it is spicy or leaves a tingle on the tongue<br />Sweetness: mild, less sweet than Mi-Del. More like eating an animal cracker than cookie. Tastes great with a slice of cheese.<br />Size: about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch, and very thin<br />Density: light<br />Overall 4 out of 5 stars. If you wanted a kid-friendly cracker-like snack, this would be 5 of 5 stars<br /><br />3. Mary's<br />Texture: VERY crunchy, not at all grainy. Texture was the least ""gluten-free"" like of the three. Felt like I was eating a regular cookie.<br />Ginger flavor: very spicy. I could only eat two or three crackers before my tongue needed a break (but I'm not big on spicy foods in general so consider me on the sensitive side). I actually prefer a ginger cookie to be like this though. Plus, it killed my pregnancy nausea in minutes - bonus.<br />Sweetness: not as sweet as Mi-Del, but not as mild as Annie's. very pleasant to me.<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick, basically the same as Mi-Del.<br />Density: Ultra light, most airy in the center<br />Overall 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Everyone's tastebuds are different, but these were my perceptions. I personally want a ginger cookie with a good ""bite"" to it, and I really can't stand gluten-free products that are grainy in texture (which seems to be most of them). I want the texture to act like a regular gluten item.  For me, Mary's fit the bill exactly, and Annie's was a close second. Annie's was so different though, I'd eat Mary's as a cookie, and Annie's as a snack, so I could see having them both in the pantry.<br /><br />The one I still want to try is Pamela's, because it has great Amazon reviews. I just don't want to buy them in bulk until I try them, so I need to find them locally."
1,"""Oreos"" are America's favorite cookie. Frankly, I've never understood the fascination. But my kids sure do! They devour these cookies. I have tried them myself, and they are very similar to the gluten-containing version. But the important thing is that my kids love them and don't have to feel like they are missing out on a vital part of American childhood!"
1,I am on a gluten free diet and enjoy the ginger snaps as a snack.  My cookie jar is often empty as my husband loves to eat them too. We have bought them at major grocery and health food stores. It is wonderful to have fresh ones delivered.  The next order is for 2 boxes a month but then one box a month until winter.  I must try them in cooking:  sauerbraten or pie filling.  They are very tasty and great with tea or coffee.  I receive the MI-Del Ginger Snaps from Amazon.
1,"I received a basket of gluten free items for Christmas and these Midel cookies were included.  These cookies tasted just like Oreo's and, so far, they are the best gluten free cookies that I have found!  I do not understand why anyone would give them a bad review.  I am glad that we received them as a gift---we just love them!"
0,"The cookie part is ok, but the filling is not good at all. It is dry and splinters apart when bitten into. The taste is barely noticeable and then all of a sudden there is an odd chemical frosting taste. *sigh* I will continue searching for a gluten free cookie, but have resigned myself to the fact that I will have to cook most everything from scratch from now on. On the bright side, it will certainly make me plan ahead better and a more inventive cook."
1,"I purchased these cookies blind, I had not tasted this brand. They were a little crumbly, but not enough to affect the taste. I thought they were wonderful, with only a few broken ones in my delivered box. I would order these again."
1,"I really struggled  finding a decent replacement for Oreo's. This is the closest thing I've found. It is a bit more grainy, due to the rice flour but the crispness is there and the chocolaty sweet taste of and Oreo is satisfied. Use it for recipes as well."
1,"Good tasting cookie.  Will satisfy your sweet tooth.  Very hard, though.  Definitely good for dunking in your coffee!"
0,THESE LITTLE COOKIES ARE VERY SPICY.<br /><br />SO IF YOU LIKE VERY SPICY THINGS YOU WILL LOVE THESE.<br /><br />FOR ME I AM NOT ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE.........
1,I try to find different snacks for my girlfriend who is gluten intolerant. She really likes these and I have had a few myself and think they taste pretty good too!
1,"These Mi-Del Pecan cookies are excellent!  They are, like all gluten free stuff pretty hard (like trying to eat a poker chip) but if you dunk them in coffee, milk or (I use) Root Beer they soften up nice and taste great!"
0,"These are my least favorite of Mi-Del's gluten-free lineup -- which is sad, because I love chocolate and caramel and had high hopes.  However, these cookies are hard and dry.  I'd compare them to biscotti, but that would be unfair to biscotti because these have neither the delightfully craggy texture nor the depth of flavor that good biscotti do.  The ""chocolate"" part of the equation comes not from true chocolate, but from cocoa, which makes the flavor dull and flat.  The caramel flavor is not awful, but it's marred by the hard-candy-like texture of the caramel bits.  And when Mi-Del describes these as ""bite-size,"" they mean it:  These cookies are approximately the size of a nickel in diameter.<br /><br />If I were to do it all over again, I'd find a bag of these in a local store and try them first.  As it stands now, I'm stuck with a case of the lil' suckers."
1,"I WAS SCEPTICAL AT FIRST ABOUT A SANDWICH, GLUTEN FREE COOKIE.  BOY WAS I WRONG!  THEY TASTE GREAT!  HOWEVER, I HAD TO STOP EATING THEM, I AM ALLERGIC TO POTATO!  WHAT A BUMMER.  I WANTED A SANDWICH COOKIE AND THIS FIT THE BILL.  I BOUGHT A CASE, TOOK SOME COOKIES TO WORK AND EVERYONE IN THE OFFICE LOVED THEM.  (I AM THE ONLY ONE WITH CELIAC DISEASE IN THE OFFICE)  SO WHEN I COULD NO LONGER EAT THE COOKIES, THE OFFICE ATE ALL MY COOKIES!  THEY WANTED MORE.  I DIRECTED THEM TO AMAZON.COM.  THE LADIES IN THE OFFICE HAD NO IDEA, GLUTEN FREE COOKIES TASTED SO GOOD.  THEY HAVE ALSO EATEN MY CHOCOLATE CHIP, GINGERSNAPS, SHORTBREAD COOKIES TOO.  SO THESE COOKIES APPEAL TO EVERYONE!"
1,"Finding gluten free products that taste decent is a challenge and I bought a box of these cookies expecting them to taste ""good"" but still, with an off taste from being gluten free. Wow, was I wrong! These cookies are amazing!! They are shaped like animals, light, crunchy, buttery, and a hint of lemon. These are hands down the best cookies I've had in my life, including ""regular"" cookies, and this is the first time I can actually say a gluten free item tastes better than its gluten counterpart.<br /><br />My WalMart sells these for 3.38/bag and I got them here for a bit over 2.00/bag with subscribe and save. This will definitely be a staple in our household! We've eaten an entire bag in less than 24 hours. Nobody could ever guess that these cookies are gluten free, they are AMAZING!!"
1,"We love these cookies, better than ""K"" vanilla.  My husband is not gluten free, and this is his favorite cookie too.  Yes, they are a crisp cookie (some may call hard), but that is why I like them.  They have a rich vanilla flavor which the ""K"" cookies do not. I carry these in my purse when when we are dining out so I have a gluten free dessert, restaurants never mind this.  For chocolate, we still like the ""K"" chocolate the best. Note: I use the auto delivery every 6 month for a better price."
1,"These are so tasty! Just the perfect amount of sweetness! They are nicely brown around the edges, so delicious!"
1,"Mi-Del Gluten-Free Ginger Snaps are the only gluten free cookies I've found that I would put on par with really good regular cookies. Besides a taste that I enjoy, they have a nice slightly chewy texture. You'll be doing double takes to make sure the label actually says gluten-free."
1,"These are the best ""wheat"" free cookeis.<br />This was a great price and availabiltiy.<br />Would love to business again! Thanks."
1,"These ginger snaps are delicious with a lot of ginger flavor. They are good alone or with fruit, and they make an excellent substitute for graham cracker crumb crust, especially with lemon merengue pie. We love them. No one would ever guess they were also gluten-free."
1,"I use these cookies to make gluten free cheesecake crusts.<br />I turn them into crumbs using a chopper and then use these crumbs in place of the graham crackers in the recipe.<br />I also use less butter than the recipe asks for in the crust as the cookies have some oil already in them.<br />Anyway the cookies taste great as a gluten free cheesecake crust and everyone gives compliments ;-)<br /><br />My husband and I also like to eat these cookies with pudding by Kozy Shack, which is also gluten free."
1,"The flavor of my first bite was unbelievably intense.  I've tried numerous GF cookies, these are my favorite by a long shot. The package has been redesigned, it is now cream & blue in color."
1,I will buy these cookies again. I am glad that I order them regardless of the not so good reviews.
1,"To date, this is the only gluten free cookie I've tried and absolutely loved.  They have a livelier flavor than vanilla wafers and are sweeter (but not too sweet) than what you expect from regular animal crackers.  I subscribed to these and am glad they come in the bulk quantity they do, since even my gluten-loving coworkers devour them as soon as they see they're out for taking."
1,"Delicious? Check!<br />Gluten free? Check!<br />Good price? Check!<br /><br />Thank you, amazon, for making these great cookies available!  It is difficult finding things to eat when you have a gluten intolerance and it is even HARDER finding things to eat that TASTE GOOD!<br /><br />All of the celiacs in my family enjoy these animal crackers! Five stars!"
1,"Mi-Del Ginger Snaps are far better in texture and flavor than any I have ever purchased. I have eaten many varieties of ginger snaps in my 85 years of life, and appreciate this as an exceptionally good product.  The only problem I have is that I can't stop eating them!"
1,"My grandson's gluten allergy led me to these cookies because animal cookies are a tradtional Christmas gift for children in our family. Our entire family loves them, but the real test is on unsuspecting gluten consuming individuals and they past the test. Recently the contractor came by in the afternoon with his son's 8 and 10 years old.  They looked hungry and so I offered cookies, with Dad's permission.  They almost wiped out the bag. Good Cookies!"
1,"These animal cracker cookies taste the most like the ""other"" kind that I have tried so far.  So much fun to eat with the grandchildren."
1,My son loves these cookies! They're tasty and reasonable-2 traits which often don't describe gluten free baked goods! Enjoy!
1,"These are great cookies.  I have two girls with celiac disease, one is a toddler. Finding foods that are like the ""real"" thing is tough these are a great treat and we love them!"
1,"These cookies are a wonderful replacement for any kid ( or grown up ) wanting to eat a long time favorite. There is about 80 cookies per bag, so it makes it well worth the money spent. They are light, buttery and crispy making them great for milk. These pack well in bags for lunch  ( don't break up easily ) so they would do great in a kid's lunch for school or daycare. I actually give these cookies to people to show them gluten free doesn't mean cardboard."
1,These ginger snaps aren't too overpowering on the ginger and go great with some milk. Really enjoyed having these in the house and they are a great buy - so affordable compared to most alternative diet foods. They'll last for at least a week or so and store well.
1,I love these cookies.  I can't eat gluten and they are a healthy treat. Family members who can eat gluten enjoy them also.
1,"Ginger Snaps are delicious.  Not too sweet and loaded with flavor. Wonderful texture, great with a nice cup of tea."
1,Very good gluten free animal cookies... We use them as re-inforcers for my son.  Very good product.
1,I picked the Cinnamon Snaps up at my Grandma's local health food store the last time I visited and loved them.  I have yet to try the ginger snaps but I'm sure they are just as good.  Hopefully Amazon will start carrying the Cinnamon Snaps.
1,"These are one of the two best gluten free animal cookies on the market.  The other being: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E48IP6"">EnviroKidz Organic Gluten-Free Animal Cookies, Vanilla, 9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>  I prefer Mi-Del because they are more economical than EnviroKidz and my daughter loves these cookies."
1,"Even if you're able to eat regular cookies (not Gluten free) you'll love these. Really sweet, and incredibly tasty. Since I can't have Gluten in my diet, these have become my staple desert. I buy them two cases at a time so I'll never run out."
1,Hard to find products that my son's diet allows him to eat.  This is a great treat.  He loves them.  I have a hard time keeping out of the opened bag of cookies myself.  They are crunchy but we love them.
1,"These ginger cookies are great if you are on a gluten-free diet. They are spicy, not too sweet and are great for dunking!"
0,This cookie is too hard to bite into and the center is like eating crispy sugar.  I did not care for these at all and now I have a whole case of them.  Guess they will end up as a pie crust or something.
1,"These are spicy, and my kids love them too. They are crispy and I am SO glad I found these after being diagnosed with Celiac."
1,"Thanks to hubby's recent diagnosis of gluten allergy, I've begun to explore the world of gluten free foods. While some are quite bland, these little cookies pack a flavorful punch! Nothing ""depriving"" here."
1,These Ginger Snaps were very good but I ordered the gluten free ginger snaps and they were shipped in error and all my complaints to Amazon were ignored.<br />Bill
0,"I ordered these for my son (age 11). He doesn't like them at all. I thought they would be similar to the Kinnikinnick cookies we get at our local health food store, but they're not. These are rock hard and although sugary, otherwise have no flavor. We'll stick with the Kinnikinnicks. I'm just hoping maybe I can use these for making a cookie crumb crust."
1,"I love these and it is the best treat.  I love cookies and couldn't find one that was very good until I found these.  I can eat a whole bag in one day!  Matter of fact, I need to order another case."
1,These cookies are so good - you'd never know that they were wheat free!  The bags are not filled anywhere near full (my only compliant - too much packaging) so a package of 8 is not really too much.  2 bags of cookies will fit in a medium clamp-top glass jar (which is how I store them in my kitchen)  Looking forward to trying the Chocolate cookies next...
1,"I have a 4 yr old and a 2 yr old that can't eat gluten and this is an awesome products for them. We always have some with us where ever we go and they absolute love them. They are moderately sweet and crunchy.<br />They also make a wonderful pie crust. 1 1/2 cup cookie crumbs, 5 TBS margerine, 1 TBS surgar. Mix and pat into pie plate. Bake 10 min at 350 degrees.<br />We couldn't live without them. Thanks Mi-Del!!!"
1,"Mi-Del: Slightly cheaper per ounce, crackers are actually animal shaped, butter cookie taste (like those that come in a tin around the holiday season)<br /><br />Envirkidz: Square cookie/cracker, vanilla flavor<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E48IP6"">Nature's Path EnviroKidz Organic Gluten-Free Animal Cookies, Vanilla, 9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />Both have similar nutrition profiles (calories, fat, grams of carbohydrate) and are GF.<br /><br />My shipment was not stale, unlike the other reviewer's complaint. Both taste fine and I find I can't put the box down sometimes, but I am not a big sugar/butter cookie fan, so I think I prefer the Envirokidz. Definitely a better deal than the local health food store and, trust me, you WILL be able to eat the whole box before they expire."
1,"Great replacement for traditional animal cookies.  My daughter, like me, cannot have gluten but loves these cookies.  I even serve them as a snack for the nursery at church.  The kids love them.... and here at Amazon, they are the right price for sharing."
1,"Although made with butter (my son is GF/CF), my son has no digestive or behavior problems after eating these.  He's thrilled to be able to have animal crackers again.  They are perfect for school snack or in the car.  The cookies are tasty enough that Mom and Dad (who do eat wheat) will snack on them as well.  They are quite pricey in the store, but Amazon's subscription price makes them fairly affordable - and much easier than always making homemade."
1,"Both my kids (8 and 4) love these cookies.  They have always been really crunchy.  We've never had them mushy like in another review.  They are not too sweet and have fun shapes.  Great for anyone gluten sensitive, and everyone else in the family."
0,"Sadly, the cookies in this shipment  were soft (they should be crunchy).  I now only buy them from the store self where they are fresh."
0,"If you are looking for mild ginger flavored snaps...these are not it.  If you however, enjoy a very strong ginger taste, give these a try."
0,"These cookies were AWFUL!  Really bad.  My co-worker and I each bit into one and we couldn't finish it.  I tried one a week or so later when I was really hungry and it was still terrible.  Not only do they not taste good, but instead of being bland, they actually taste BAD and leave a horrible aftertaste.  I buy a lot of Gluten Free products and almost everything is really good but this was far from it."
0,"Took FOREVER to arrive and the case is way too many cookies to consume! Will stick to my local organic grocery next time. Once again, ordering food from Amazon has fallen far below expectations."
1,"Thank you so much for selling the packets!!!!!!!!<br />I used to be able to purchase the packets at my local grocery store, but now they only carry the bottle of liquid sauce & I don't like it as much.  Each time I make a purchase I send 1/2 to my mom and keep the rest for my family."
1,"Purchased two of these from seller ""Penguin Mints"" (fulfilled by Amazon) and they arrived in fresh condition.  These are better than having 12 regular sized pops (approx an equivalent total weight) because they are so thick it takes literally an hour to get a piece soft enough to chew it off!  Great for satisfying a sweet tooth with actually very little sugar (per hour of enjoyment that is).  Of course, brushing after any sugary snack is important and these more so, since they take so long to consume (even a small portion of them) that you will be bathing your teeth in sugar for long periods of time (which is taking the fast lane for cavities).  Also, it's best to quickly rinse them and wrap them in wax paper or plastic wrap and place them in the fridge for storage between nibbling sessions."
1,"I was looking for a good tea to replace some excellent Sencha I picked up in japan. This tea is very good - maybe not quite the quality of the tea I got in Japan, but it's still quite good.<br /><br />The size of the tin is a little misleading, there is a sealed mylar bag of tea within the tin, and if you dumped it out into the tin, it would barely fill it half way."
1,"Excellent sencha style green tea.  Beautiful color, amazing flavor.  Brewer must be careful however, goes from sublime to bitter in a matter of seconds.  The difference between 1 minute and 1 minute 30 seconds is remarkable.  Easy to ruin, but highly recommended when brewed correctly."
1,"Add the eggs, butter, milk, and whatever you want to fill it with and you can become an instant culinary genius."
1,Well packaged and almost fresh (you're bound to lose a little fizz after a 6000 mile journey)! I bought the litre bottles when the smaller bottle were unavailable. I then filled up some small Lucozade bottles I had saved. Just as good!
1,"One of the pleasures of a Keurig is that you can serve a friend or a guest a cup of coffee that will please them and their tastes, not just what you brew for yourself everyday.  I happen to enjoy strong, deeply roasted blends (the kind that you usually find at the specialty coffee shops which seem to be all over the place now).  However, not everyone shares my enjoyment of a strong, full-bodied cup of coffee.<br /><br />I have many friends who often say something like ""I love coffee but Starbucks is just too strong for me"".  Enter Donut Blend.  I have purchased many boxes of Coffee People's Donut Shop Coffee and it is a favorite for many of my friends and family.  When Timothy's announced that they were coming out with the ""Original Donut Blend"" I got in line to try it.  Here is my take on it:<br /><br />It is certainly a little lighter than Coffee People's version but the taste is more complex with clean, bright notes of spice and low acidity.  Surprisingly, it reminds me a little of the Peaberry Kona coffee that I brought back from Hawaii.  It is a perfect blend for those who like their coffee black or with just a little cream and still want it to taste like coffee.  If someone drinks several cups a day I think that Timothy's Donut Blend will not overwhelm their taste buds and will still taste fresh cup after cup.  Mind you, I drink Newman's Own Bold Blend on a regular basis and will continue to do so, but if I am having more than two cups (for those ""special"" mornings when nothing seems to go right) or if I am having a cup later in the day I will drink this one.<br /><br />Just rating it on what I want in a coffee I give it four stars, but judging it for what it is (and not just what I like), it fully delivers and deserves five stars.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK"">Coffee People Medium Extra Bold, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]"
1,"When my wife and I had to make a selection from more than 100 varieties of<br />K-Cups available for our new Keurig brewer, we made a rating sheet copied<br />from the Keurig listing of all the brands and types.  We marked a rating<br />of one to five points for each cup we drank for several months. A rating<br />of one point meant ""Perfect, couldn't be better"", and five points<br />indicated ""Don't like this one"".  We rated one to nine cups of each of 30<br />coffees evaluated.  Timothy's Extra Bold Parisian Nights came out on top<br />with the most number one ratings.<br /><br />We found that our preference was for the Extra Bold Roasts.  We do not<br />prefer the weaker strengths.  The Parisian Nights has great flavor and<br />aroma with no bitterness.  This is a great cup of coffee.<br /><br />We're now on our sixth Subscribe and Save shipment of 4 boxes every two<br />months which proves our satisfaction with this coffee."
1,"I'm a chocoholic and have tried every mocha, swiss almond chocolate, etc. coffee I've ever seen, k-cup and not k-cup.  This is the best.  It may actually be better than German chocolate cake--it's like a no-cal, fat-free dessert.  My favorite way to drink it right now is to throw in a packet of Splenda and a little bit of Organic Valley chocolate soy milk, though it's good without sweetener or creamer.  It's chocolaty, with a hint of coconut.  I highly recommend for anyone who likes coffee (it's not a weak coffee, like most of the flavored kcups I've tried).  Also, Amazon's price for Timothy's is the best I can find, subscribe and save price comes out to around $0.37 a cup.  Enjoy!!"
1,"Timothy's Colombian Decaffeinated is a good tasting coffee for a good price.  The savings are even better if you sign up for the auto renew program.  Also, we have found that you can use each cup twice.  Therefore it's like getting twice the quantity for the money.  I checked with the Keurig company and they said by processing the cups for two cups of coffee or tea will not hurt the machine.<br /><br />  Best, Al"
1,"I bought a Keurig coffee maker for Christmas this year. We all enjoy different coffees in our household and making a pot of any type coffee is a waste. My husband is an espresso drinker, so I purchased Timothy's World Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso coffee to be made with the small setting on the coffee maker which uses 5.25 oz water. This makes it stronger, and he really has enjoyed this coffee. I really recommend this to anyone who enjoys a bold espresso coffee. He was born and raised in Italy and has purchased his coffee grounds from Italy for years to make an authentic cup of espresso. He is fussy about his espresso, so if he likes this one, it must be good."
1,"Thanks to our purchase of a Keurig, I am a converted coffee drinker. Timothy's German Chocolate Cake is my absolute favorite. A delectable blend of warm caramel and coconut gives this coffee a deliciously sweet note while retaining a medium-bodied blend. It isn't too sugary - it's just right! In fact, my hubby and his coworkers all claim this as their number one flavored coffee too. It is scrumptious."
1,I currently use Coffee People's version of Donut Shop and when I saw Timothy's version I wanted to give it a try. This is not as full body as Coffee People's version but I really like the smooth low acidity taste. If you don't want a bold rich flavor I think you will love this smooth great tasting coffee as much as I do.
1,"I purchased this item after reading through the reviews on Amazon.  I have to say that I haven't been disappointed. The cups contain a blend of arabica and kona coffee.  They brew with a nice aroma and color.  I would describe them as a medium roast with a medium strength.  Depending on your mood you can adjust the strength by adjusting the cup size and changing your creamer.  I've had success using whole milk, half and half, and light cream, with light cream being the best in my opinion.  The taste is mellow and very smooth.  I have read other reviews here that have described them as weak or tasteless.  This is simply not the case.  I would compare it to the coffee from Dunkin Donuts.  If you prefer your coffee extra bold, dark roasted, or strong (Starbucks) then you are just not going to be happy with these.  Also, if you prefer to ""double brew"" your cups to get the most for your money, you will be very disappointed.  These will brew a delicious cup of coffee, but only if you use them as directed.  Finally I have to say that Amazon is the best place to buy these.  They have the best prices and fast shipping.  Add this to your subscribe and save to get 15% extra off."
1,"For those who like a bit more flavor than the soft breakfast blends -- this is the best of the bunch.  I have worked through most brand ""bolds"" and come back to this one every time.  Black Tiger is similar but does not have some of the added flavor notes found here."
1,"I use this stuff like it was ketchup, honestly. It goes with everything. Hoisin is awesome on chinese food, thai food, vietnamese food, its good with hamburgers, fries, and even with steak instead of steak sauce. Hoisin is sweet, and salty and has this certain kick to it that makes it unique amoung condiments. The first time i ever saw it used was when i was watching PBS Yan Can Cook, and he busted out the Lee Kum Kee bottle and i was mesmerized with its rich brown color, and Yan Can do no wrong with me!!!!"
1,"This is from the company's website FAQ: ""Our Hoisin Sauce does not contain peanuts or milk, but it does contain wheat flour, which is an allergenic substance to some people.

1,Why make it yourself at this price? Well packaged and it arrived quickly.<br /><br />I will buy it again when the time comes.
1,"Prefect.. i lovvveee this stuff. i needed some Hoisin Sauce for a recipe i was making i had never heard of the stuff before, so i came to amazon and looked it up, wasn't badly priced so i ordered it. when i received it i was very surprised. very sweet & tangy i can use it on about anything will defiantly be ordering more of this."
1,"I love, love, love the Nanami Togarashi seasoning.  Having moved away from a Yoshinoya restaurant, I missed it so much.  I contacted Yoshinoya and asked where I could purchase the seasoning and they directed me to Amazon.  I was so thrilled I ordered three!  This stuff is great on rice, chow mein, chicken, beef, and more.  I liberally sprinkle it on many things I eat.  In fact, I sneak it into restaurants in my purse and sprinkle it on my food.  I know that must sound insane but that's how much I love this product.  The price is right, too.  I could go on forever about it but I won't.  Just try it!"
1,"I love this stuff...I make baked sweet potato fries and use this to season them. RECIPE: slice three sweet potatoes into large strips, toss them in 2T olive oil, bake at 400 degrees for 25 minutes, using a spatula turn them and bake another 25 minutes. Mix 1 Teaspoon Togarashi, 1 Teaspoon sugar (or stevia), 1/2 Teaspoon salt. Toss the potatoes in this mixture and voila! We are crazy about them and they are so good for us."
1,My grandmother used to travel home to Japan in the 70's and bring this back with her and then we found a grocer in DC that sold S&B products.....  They have since closed and I was so happy to find it online.  The spice is great on everything!  Good memories!
1,"This is the same red little bottle you'll see in Japanese restaurants in Japan and the US, with a key ingredient substituted out. I've always heard it called ""shichimi"", the alternate pronunciation of seven (nana). There are 7 spices in here. In Japan, the mix contains hemp seed, which has been replaced in the US market with orange peel.<br /><br />It's great over yakitori skewers, pizza, ramen, or anything you want to add a little dash of flavor too. Spiciness is very very mild."
1,I grew up on S&B Togarashi and have tried many other togarashi products in an attempt to find an easier source of this wonderful spice.  None of the other brands and sources measured up.  I now purchase S&B Togarashi in case lots here on Amazon!
1,"This is a very excellent mildly-fiery addition to just about anything.  Sprinkle it over traditional Japanese fare such as udon, omurice, or okonomiyaki - or on such treats as hamburgers, salmon steaks, or BLTs!  It gives a wee 'kick' to just about anything savoury."
1,"I ordered this spice after having dinner at Roy's in Naples, FL.  They serve edamame with a version of this spice.  This is very good but not exactly what we had.  I use this spice now for an assortment of menus and it makes everything taste better.  Not very spicy so everyone likes it."
1,"Excellent!  This is not the first time purchased.  Love to add it to many types of foods/dishes.  Many of our friends also like it; in fact, we buy extra bottles so that we can pass them out to our friends!"
1,"I'd read about this product and while in an Asian market quite a distance away I decided to buy some to give it a try.  I now have four bottles as a back-up, ordering thru Amazon, which is much cheaper than several hours worth of gas.  I gave some as a gift to a buddy, and he's really enjoyed it ... he's a ""believer"".  This goes with almost anything, though some things are more suitable than others.  It's got some zip, but it's not too hot.  If you haven't tried it, do so ... it's a treat."
1,"First, I'm a wimp when it comes to hot peppers. This seasoning is a perfect blend of peppers & other spices. it adds just the right amount of heat. I add it to many of my dishes and it always enhances it. Especially, if my dish turned out a little sweeter than I wanted it. This spice evens it out. Of course, the more you use the hotter it is. Go light, taste & sprinkle more if needed. You can always add but you can't take it out once it's in there. My whole family likes it."
1,"I first tried this at our local Japanese restaurant and fell in love. I had to buy some for myself, for home use. It makes instant Ramen or Udon ten times better and is wonderful on Soba.<br />I recommend this highly."
1,I discovered this stuff at a restaurant in Singapore and fell in love with the flavor; use it on everything now whenever I have it. What I cant get my head around is why they dont sell it in larger bottles; I can go thru 1 of these a week.
1,"I'm crazy about this spice! I only recently bought a bottle just because I liked the way it looked mostly... and now I'm totally addicted. It is the perfect amount of heat. I'm almost out of it and can't remember the store that I bought it at. So glad that Amazon carries it. I sprinkle it on everything including spinach salads, deviled eggs,  corn on he cob and mangos. Even good on watermelon."
1,This is abolutley the best and tastiest mix of all. Wonderful by its self. Love it on home made hamburgers instead of lettuce.
1,"This tea is amazingly tasty white tea. For most people they may not know what white tea taste like. Where black tea has the acidic taste of coffee and green tea has a very earth/leafy taste, white tea comes in as you would expect for its color. It is very light tasting with almost a lightly sweet maltiness to it. It doesn't have any of the harshness that you could find in black tea or coffee. And you can't really over brew it to release off-flavors as there is so little to the leaves. I find this tea works best for iced tea, it works well cold and has a much more refreshing flavor that other teas do on a summer day.<br />Of course there are there is the added benefit that it is good for you. If you want to try white tea, this is the product for you.<br />I purchased the organic version before I purchased this one. I saw this one was cheaper so I gave it a try, and I couldn't readily notice any difference. I ended up just mixing the two boxes together and will continue to buy the non-organic in the future as long as it is the cheaper of the two."
1,"Excellence is what we've come to expect every time we open a bag of a Bob's Red Mill product, and their Soy Flour is no exception.  Soft as cornstarch, it adds just the right amount of low-gluten volume to allow for more successful results when working with vegetarian/vegan alternatives or ultra-soft muffin or pastry doughs.  I've been an avid home baker for over 25 years, and for as long as I've been able to get them, Bob's Red Mill flours and grains have been regular stock in my pantry.  Buon Apetito!"
1,"Bob's Red Mill is always of the highest quality and i always choose their brand over any other.  That being said I must emphatically say that Soy Flour is pretty darn nasty tasting.  I suggest that if you are going to use it, blend it in with other flours (if you can).  you can probably get used to the taste, but kinda leaves an aftertaste that is unpleasant to me at least. good luck!"
1,MY HUSBAND IS A HUGE FAN OF BUCKEWHEAT ME NOT SO MUCH...<br />BUT WHEN I TRIED THESE PANCAKES I BECAME A HUGE FAN ALSO...<br />THE ARE LIGHT AND FLUFFY WITH GREAT FLAVOR....UMMMM
1,Took me right back to my childhood.  Great product and would recommend to all.  I will Definitely buy more.  Received package in record time
1,"This is the best all around seasoning ever. No MSG and lots of flavor. We use it on fish, chicken, salads,vegetables, dressings, eggs....almost everything. It adds great seasoning to your recipes."
1,"I have been using this seasoning for 6 years now and it is my ""go to"" seasoning. Like the other reviewer said it complements all meats and fish, it also excellent for cooked greens. But my favorite is to use it for making homemade salad dressing instead of buying over priced salad seasoning packs or premade dressings. I too appreciate that it has no MSG and it has no artificial ingredients! Thanks for keeping it real Konriko:)"
0,"These waffles tasted ""blah"". The ""waffle"" part was more like a bad cookie and the chocolate is sub par.  I was very hopeful that these would be good and some what healthy as the package says no sugar. It's high calorie for a ""cookie"" and terrible tasting. I will not purchase again."
1,"We've been eating these pears for over 2.5 years at least twice a day.  Gerber's organic variety is the cheapest price per oz I've found for an ""organic pear-only"" baby food.  Amazon's price (without Prime) is slightly less than our local grocery store when purchased at regular price.  This is the best price I've found outside special sales.  Contrary to the other review, almost all baby food is ""cooked"" via some method, usually steaming - even if homeade - which I did for a long time before switching to packaged versions for convenience and inaccessibility to organic produce.  The homeade raw puree works better for her child, but this product has been great for us.  It's been solving our constipation issues for over two years, and it works wonderfully!"
0,"I've been giving my daughter Gerber fruits, veggies, and meat as everyday-meals since she was 6 months old, thinking that she's got enough vitamins and prebiotics. However, she developed digestive problem and chronic constipation; she almost stopped gaining weight since she was 9 months old. I took her to GI and she told me that those packed fruits are all cooked! And there are additives to keep them fresh for long period of time! I started to puree fruits and veggies using Vitamix, and only use Gerber fruits&veggies when we are out and about. Now, after half a year of probiotics and wholesome food, she's slowly getting better and opens her mouth to food.<br />Now, think about this: if you puree an apple and leave it alone for 5 minutes, it'll change color due to oxidation. So, how can Gerber's apple puree keep the same color for so long a time?"

1,Its taste and smell is good.<br />Maybe my Babe likes the strawberry in it.<br />We have taken several types of Gerber 2nd foods.
1,"Like that is it organic, don't like that it comes in plastic containers.  Earth's Best was always our first choice, but Gerber Organics comes a close second."
0,"When you get this home and read the ingredients list, you will see: This product has ""organic"" stamped all over it, but when you read the ingredients list, it includes tuna oil that is not organic. I called the company, and they said the product ""does not have harmful levels of mercury.""  I prefer my bananas with NO mercury, thanks. They include tuna oil to provide a source of DHA, but there are several baby products that have plant-based sources of DHA. We are vegetarian, and I don't want to feed fish oil to my baby. I recommend other brands like Earth's Best which seem to be more careful about their ingredients. I'm sure this is fine for people who are feeding tuna fish to their babies anyway, but we don't plan to give ours tuna fish."

1,"yum, yum. yum!!!!  have ordered these often, for birthday parties, funeral, `I Love You'.  It is a lot of candy & can be shared for a long time."
0,"I LOVE foie gras in pretty much any form, however its honestly not for anyone on a budget or middle class for sure. I decided to go with grade B because of the $30 difference. I assumed it with just be veinier. It was veinier but also lacked that great earthy duck taste that you get with grade A and with the canned product. I felt like i was eating chicken liver or something. It wasnt worth the price. I suggest you continue to splurge on grade A. But if you are making a pate' then grade B might suffice- hope this helps"
1,Evanger's Super Premium Pheasant and Brown Rice is a wonderful food for dogs.  I own a Shiba Inu who is very picky about the food we feed her.  It was a challenge finding the right combination of food that would not make her sick or have an upset stomach.  I put this food in front of her and now she paws at the pantry requesting more.  For all dog owners who own a dog who is particular about their food this may be the answer.  I try not to feed my dog table scraps and instead invest in a good dog food with the right nutrients.  My girl is currently eating the Evanger's brand mixed with Stella and Chewey's raw patties.  She absolutely loves the combination!
1,"The pet food store gave me five different samples so I thought I'd let Louie, my standard poodle, make the decision. I put the five samples in five bowls. He went for the Evangers and wolfed it down. First time I have seen him enthusiastic about dry dog food. Of course, this is a dog that drinks out of the toilet."
1,"We adopted a standard poodle about a year and a half ago.  She had a hard time just surviving until we discovered she couldn't eat chicken or beef without getting sick.  It's very hard to find a commercial dog food that doesn't have one of those as a major ingredient.  Even many of the lamb and rice formulas have chicken in some form as a major ingredient.  I was making her food fresh twice a week, approximately a three hour process each time.  We had to hand feed it to her most of the time.  Then one day she decided she was done with the food she'd been eating for months.  I had some sample packets of Evanger's Pheasant and Brown Rice.  She ate it!  And she has continued to eat it, a big step for her.  Finally, a quality food, commercially prepared, that she can eat without getting sick and will eat all by herself.  And it's wonderful to have it available on Amazon.  Life's gotten so much easier."
1,"Great product! This dog food has a very healthy rating from professional canine associations..  My Jack Russell loves the taste,  the price is right and the shipper very reliable."
1,I have a Shitzu and a Papillion who have tried many good brands of dog food and never like them.  THey would only eat a little bit at a time throught the day. THe foods which contained peas never agreed with their stomach and so many foods have them.  Why? I don't understand as they are not people and don't need peas. They were both a little on the light side.  Recently I switched to Evangers Pheasant Brown Rice dry dog food.  THey both gobbled it up. I was mixinbg it with their old food and they picked out the Evangers and only ate it.  Their stomachs were fine right away with no problems making the change in diet.  THey both now feel like they should.  THe gained a little weight and look wonderful. I am also giving them a little of the canned Duck that they make as a treet in the food.  THey love it all.
1,"First of all, I usually don't write reviews but I've always been a fan of spicy food and of course pepper jellys. I purchased the Stonewall Hot Pepper Jelly recently and was impressed.  I use it with butter on crumpets and muffins and often a small bit on a Ritz cracker and brie cheese.  That's good!  The flavor is sweeter than others I've tried but the spicy pepper flavor still jumps out and enhances the sugar on my tongue.  We'll serve it at our Superbowl party by warming slightly and pouring over a wedge of Brie placed on a wedge shaped triangular plate with crackers or those mini toasts."
1,I agree that this jelly is delicious.  I serve it spread on cornmeal crepes filled with goat cheese.  Everyone always loves them
1,This pepper jelly is my favorite. Just the right amount of sweet with a small kick. Perfect with just cream cheese and crackers.
1,"I loved this candy when I was a child but could only get 3 on any given day.  I used to say that when I became grown, I would buy a room filled with coconut long boys (I always did exaggerate. When I saw that large tub of long boys it took my back to my days as a child and the taste was just like I remembered."
1,"These candies are addicting~!......down here in Miami they are only available in certain neighborhood, so this tub was perfect. You won't be disappointed if you  like coconut and caramel...."
1,This candy is hard to find in stores nowadays. Long Boys were packaged well. They were fresh and as good as I remember. I'm glad I purchased them.
1,"This is my favorite candy from way back, I was so excited when I found it on Amazon.com The candy was very fresh, it was shipped really fast and the quantity was just right, enough to have on hand for quite a while before its time to re-order."
0,Unfortunately the product is packed in a box that is not substantial enough to protect the crackers from breaking in transit.  Only about half of the crackers in each package remain in tact.  The cost is a really good deal as long as you don't need the crackers to be in tact.
0,"While the product itself is a great tasting gluten free food. Amazon did not securely ship these fragile crackers. The package comes in a case of 12. When the box arrived to my home, ten of the trays where completely crushed into tiny cracker fragments. Amazon did not make the effort to enclose the crackers in a safe shipping box. And when I looked into returning the crackers, the website informed me that this was a non-returnable product. After further searching on the Amazon website, to find a way to return a damaged product, and not having any luck, I gave up. I ended up using the crackers as cracker crumbles in soups and such - This was not my initial intent. Based on this one bad experience, I will never order another food item through Amazon again."
1,These are great and totally adictive. I agree with other reviews that unfortuantly they do often come a bit broken but I can live with that. The alternative would be to have massives of packaging to protect them and surely we don't want any more excessive packaging.<br />Let's not encourage suppliers to do that. What's a broken cracker compared to a broken planet?<br />I just save the whole ones for entertaining and enjoy the broken ones as my snack! They are delicious whole or broken!
1,These crackers are DELICIOUS!!!!<br />I bought some at my local organic food mart for $4.25 a pack.  I searched Amazon and now can buy them a case at a time for about $3.36 a pack. WHAT A GREAT DEAL!!<br /> These crackers have the best taste. They are addicting.  They go great with many cheeses and wines.  I really love them.
1,"These are yummy. Black sesame, cheddar, and vegetable flavors are all excellent, low fat, and gluten free. Hard to find in local grocery stores around here at least...."
1,this is a really good snack especially when you can't eat wheat. Not as salty as the other type of rice cracker. I am enjoying them.
1,"Good taste, great crunch, some broken crackers, just a little too salty (for me) to use with dips that are also plenty salty.  I think I'll try the unsalted organic brown rice snaps since the unsalted sesame brown rice snaps are discontinued."
1,"Hey couch potatoes and lovers of pure food!  These are dynamite crackers!  Get 'em!  They are made with rice flour, so all of you who need to avoid gluten can enjoy them.  They are unique and delicious.  Gormet and organic.  And the case price is perfect.  The only problem is that they do arrived a bit broken up.  :-(  It seemed that about 1/3 of the crackers were not in whole pieces.  We could live with this, especially for the price, but some folks might find that offensive.  However, we LOVE these crackers and will order them again.  They are not available in our local stores, so ordering them from amazon.com is the way to go for us."
1,"Excellent, simple cup of morning coffee that is not bitter nor truly extra bold as advertised.  I consider it to be a medium roast/breakfast blend kind of coffee.  If you are into heavy, dark roasts like French, Italian, or Sumatran, then the Kenya AA may be fairly mild for your taste.  However, I love it.  Unfortunately, the one-star review is an angry comment regarding price and has nothing to do with the quality of the coffee."
1,"We own two Keurig Platimun coffee machines. One at home and one at the office. The preponderance of people who do not care for the flavored blends prefer the Kenyan blend, myself at the top of the list. I have had Kenyan from Timothy's and Gloria Jean's and they do not begin to compare."
0,"I bought these expecting a replacement for my beloved but discontinued Van Houtte Kenya Kilimandjaro K-Cups. Those were dark, robust, and fruity with plenty of flavor to stand up to cream.<br /><br />Well, these are not close at all. At best, it is a medium roast and cream just dilutes the flavor. Maybe OK if you drink your coffee black, but not all Kenyan coffees are the same. If it didn't say ""Extra Bold,"" I would not have guessed this was an Extra Bold K-Cup; the flavor just isn't there."
1,"This was a nice Strong cup of coffee even on the largest setting, it arrived on time as promised well packaged, and I will order this item again. Satisfactory tasting bold morning coffee, wake me up smooth blend not bitter.  I will recommend this product to my friends."
1,My husband and I really enjoyed this coffee and were disappointed when I couldn't find it again to purchase on Amazon.  Hope it comes back cuz it's really a great coffee.
1,I have always liked Kenyan coffee since I visited Nairobi and Green Mountain Coffee is an excellant product too.  I am currently in Afghanistan and it really picks up the spirits to have a good cup of coffee whenever you feel like.
0,"Unless I'm missing where this is for 2 boxes or something, this is WAY overpriced!  You can buy this directly from Keurig for $15, $13 is you're a member!  Do people really fall for this?  Amazon, why do you let them get away with it?"
0,"If you like ginger, there is not much here. We were trying to find large ginger pieces surrounded by chocolate like that found at a small candy store in Hilo. These were nothing like that. Look for an Australian supplier."
1,"I enjoyed the garlic flavor of these noodles, but it is quite a small portion.  I used these noodles in a stir fry dish with broccoli and red bell peppers, which was quite tasty."
1,"I got these at a local grocery store and love the flavor. The crunch is also excellent. I picked up the Kettle Brand as well, which were not as good as these. The Kettle brand were way too pungent with the vinegar flavor and not as crispy. These seem to have buttermilk in them that adds to the overall flavor. Lay's Kettle cooked have become my favorite chips."
1,My cat loves these. If I can't find her all I have to do is shake the bottle and she comes running unless she is trapped in a closet which she is prone to do. The treats are really cheap  and according to my kitty yummy too.
1,"For what ever reason my two dogs just love these little Pounce real chicken treats for cats - We give them each 4 of these treats prior to bedtime, at it appears that the dogs have learned to count them?"
1,"This is the only treat my Red Persian will eat.  She is very large, and will eat everything in sight from the other cats in my home,  But this treat is the only one for her.  If I put out something else for the other cats, she will leave it alone, and wait for this one.  I'll be in Big trouble if this is ever discontinued."
1,The best Yerba Mate ever. Healthy and with some herbs that make you feel good! I've been using it since for ever.
1,"Looking forward to the tasty results, but these cannot be used in a hotair popper. We tried them in our our new Presto and they just fell out in to the bowl uncooked. Called Presto; they immediately knew what was wrong - ""Are you using a gourmet corn that is small? There is not enough weight for them to be exposed to the hot air long enough......!"" This is not the seller's fault but be aware you can't pop these in - at least - a Presto hotair popper."
1,"I could not disagree more with the other reviewer!  I think that this is the best popcorn.  Purple, Red and Baby Whites are my favorites.  I can't even eat Orville since having this.  There is just no comparison. Worth every penny and then some!"
1,I ordered this popcorn directly from the company and it pops up to be the best. Ladyfinger and purple are wonderful. Won't be eating any other brand. I did pop with oil so maybe it's different in a hotair popper.
1,"I just finished eating my first batch of this great popcorn made in my presto air popper. The trick to getting it to pop properly with minimal un-popped kernels is to tilt the air popper back at an angle while waiting for the first dozen or so to pop. After the chamber starts filling with popped corn, set the popper upright and you are good to go! Hope this helps. Really great popcorn too by the way."
1,Popcorn is the same as from the Amish Popcorn website.<br />your big benefit is that it has regular shipping costs and not high shipping like the website.
1,"In this package you get three varieties of popcorn, all of which are different, light, fluffy, and fun to eat. Two are of the hulless variety (very tasty and won't stick in between your teeth as much), and the purple kind has a thick kernel and a uniquely nutty taste. All of these stand up to any kind of butter, salt, or seasonings that you might throw their way, and I highly recommend this as a starter package for yourself or a nice gift for one of your corn-poppin' friends."
1,"When I came across this Amish Country Popcorn I thought, well why not have some fun and diversity for a change. Ol' Orville looks like a fun-loving guy, so he would agree I'm sure. Heck, he is probably living in Malibu, floating in his horizon pool with his companion Bonita...<br /><br />Started out with the smallest variety, the Ladyfinger. Tiny yellow kernels pop into tiny tender popcorns. Hardly a hull, nothing sticks in your teeth. Harder to eat because of the small size. Cute and delicious. Little kids would like this, cooked just for them.<br /><br />Next was the Baby White. These barely yellow kernels are sort of medium size and like the Ladyfinger variety have little in the way of hulls and are very tender. A quality choice and easier to eat because it pops up larger. Probably more like popcorn from the old days.<br /><br />Lastly, the Purple. Most seem to like this the best. Full size and easy to eat. Again, not too much in the way of hulls. The kernels are purple and they pop to white with purple flecks. Attractive and full size, easy to eat. Nice sort of nutty taste, although popcorn is pretty mild stuff no matter what brand you get.<br /><br />I used a Whirly Pop, a device I recommend. Coat the bottom with olive oil, almost cover the bottom with seeds, turn the heat up to around medium (not too low) and slowly turn the crank. Stop when the popping stops, as it does pretty abruptly, and pour it into a bowl. I season with sea salt and ground pepper. For the butter part, I mix about a small spoonfull of real butter with a slug or three of olive oil, heated together in the micro. Definite butter flavor without all the fat. Not a bad compromise at all.<br /><br />All varieties popped almost completely, not many duds.<br /><br />This makes a great breakfast, takes just a few minutes.<br /><br />This popcorn is advertised as from Amish country and presumably is more a traditional style of corn, maybe a heritage variety, not a genetically modified product like Orville's. This is a controversial subject, important to many people and this product is an alternative to ""Corporate Popcorn"" for them."
1,"Great product, probably a couple dollars pricey. I think PURPLE, BABY WHITE and then LADYFINGER were my favorite in that order."
1,"This was a gift to my grandson (7) and he loves it, especially the colors.  He is a Cub Scout and the Pack sold popcorn, but my son thought having different colors to experiment for him after the sales would be fun to have.  I'm sure he will want more when the bags are all eaten.<br /><br />This was a Verified Amazon Purchase"
1,Very tender and light popcorn. I use the Back to Basics stainless steel stove top popcorn popper.
1,I purchased 50 lbs of the Ladyfinger Popcorn<br />It is awesome popcorn!!<br />If you use 1/2 cup of popcorn in a pot and just<br />cover with oil...leave the lid off until it<br />starts popping then cover until it almost<br />stops popping...remove the lid.  It comes out<br />perfect with hardly no unpopped kernels.  I<br />use an old pressure cooker pot with a hole<br />where the gauge would go.  Works Great!!!!<br />I wouldn't buy any other popcorn...  This is<br />the best...small kernels...hulless...
1,VERY YUMMY POP CORN I GOT THIS<br />FOR MY SON WE MADE IT THAT NITE ALL THE<br />CORN POPED AND A GREAT TASTE THEY WHERE SO GOOD<br />THAT YOU DIDNT NEED TO ADD BUTTER
1,"I'd heard and read great things about the Amish Country Popcorn so I ordered this set with the 3 different 1lb bags of kernels. They ALL were very delicious, and popped up wonderfully (we are using the outstanding West Bend 82306 Stir Crazy 6-Quart Electric Popcorn Popper [..] by the way).<br /><br />My kids really enjoy the lady finger popcorn due to the miniature size of the kernels.<br /><br />While all 3 kinds are delicious, we've decided that the purple are our favorite (large, firm kernels, great for buttering) and will be ordering just the purple next time.<br /><br />This set was a great way to try out several kinds of kernels at once :)"
1,"Our family loves popcorn.  The Amish Country Popcorn is wonderful...tender, tasty and delightful.  We love the nearly hull less kernels and the tiny size of the popped product.  So good to enjoy while watching movies or even just curling up and reading a good book."
1,Regular popcorn shreds my gums and gets stuck deep down in them. This popcorn is a dream. It is easy on my gums and nothing gets stuck.<br /><br />I like to put 1/4 cup of kernels into a paper lunch bag and microwave it. The flavors are fantastic without adding anything to it. I'll never buy regular popcorn again.
0,Save your money.<br />Go buy yellow or white popcorn from your local grocery store (under a $1.00 a lb.).<br />They are charging $4.80 a pound here.<br />I found two of the three verities they are selling here are no more than yellow and white popcorn which cost less than $1.00 a lb. at your local grocery store.<br />Their third verity here the 'Purple' has no significant different taste or flavor than yellow or white popcorn.<br />Popcorn is popcorn after being popped.<br />Also save your money on their caramel topping. You are just buying brown sugar.<br />They are charging ($11.58) for a 10 oz. jar of what amounts to brown sugar.<br />A 2 lb. bag of brown sugar is around $2.00 at your local grocery store.<br />By the way brown sugar a very good popcorn topping in my opinion.  As good as I have found.<br />So there you are.<br />My opinion for what it's worth.
0,"This does not work in a hot Air Popper.  It is light in weight and size. and the hot air blows it out of the popper.  Might be okay for other type of poppers, but not Hot Air, like the Presto Units."
0,you cant use an air popper for these because they are to small and just fly out I dont know how they taste I gave them away to a friend who had a kettle popper
1,"Please take the numbers in this review with a pinch of salt (and maybe a little butter).<br /><br />My pack came today.  The directions said that a serving was 3 tablespoons, so I took one tablespoon of each of the three varieties and put them in my (very old) hot air popper and turned it on.  It popped fine with only a few un-popped kernels  and the number of old maids more numerous but also very small -- perhaps 1/3 of the number that I get with ""regular"" popcorn.  The popped kernels are about half the size of regular popcorn when popped, but the that's to be expected since they are about 1/2 the size when it starts out.  The flavor of all three varieties is good and I could tell that there were at least two different varieties based on the taste.  I could not distinguish between the three varieties visually (but I didn't do a careful inspection, I just grabbed a handful and glanced at it as I was putting it in my mouth.  I used about half a tablespoon of melted (real) butter and a decent size pinch of salt.  I thought the three tablespoon serving was reasonable, perhaps not as much as I usually eat by volume but probably slightly more than I usually eat in terms of number of kernels.  I'll try some tomorrow popped in oil and post an edit to this review.<br /><br />In summary, it's a touch pricy for popcorn, but the flavor is slightly different from grocery store  popcorn and I'd buy it again (especially with free (Prime) shipping)."
1,"Popcorn very good, I did not get all the kernels to pop. May have been my popper. Price was a little high for the amount of popcorn received."
0,Popcorn tastes OK -- but the kernal pop way too small.  It's like a whole bowl of the bottom of the tub of popcorn crumbs.  Regular Orville Redenbacher popcorn is much better
1,"We bought this for our air popper and we ""LOVE"" the Purple corn! The smaller corns like the baby white is too small to pop in an air popper, I had it all over my kitchen when I tried. However we have a LOVE for that great PURPLE corn! We need to support more Amish farms that care about the integrity of the foods they grow (not trying to make a buck on GMO's). It is well worth every penny spent. Tried the Blue corn too recently and that was awesome, the family loves this stuff."
0,After popping the Amish Country corn I found many hulls that did not pop.  The corn wasn't very fluffy and tough to eat.
0,"I had expected a large popped pot of popped corn but what I received after popping was a ""fresh, but small popped kernals. They were rather tasteless. I still have 2 3/4 lbs. left and probably will seek another brand."
0,"One of three packages, LADY FINGER TYPE,  was inedible and did not pop. Could not determine until used other two types which were ok."
0,"I am disappointed in this product. For reasons unknown to me, it doesn't pop well at all in my electric air popper.<br />I've never had a problem with other brands. Perhaps it has to do with the small size of the kernels. But rather than pop, they pretty much just fly around the kitchen...unpopped!!"
1,"I don't pretend to be a popcorn expert but either fresh or even  a few days old, salted, I'll eat it. Of the three offered in this package, I don't have a favorite. They are all tasty in their own way."
1,"This popcorn pops up in very small kernals.  However, the flavor is very good and much better than the ""store"" bought popcorn.  The small baby white is my favorite.  The purple is the most bland.  Overall though, worth buying if you like good popcorn."
1,"I was on-line looking for a popcorn popper for a wedding gift.  The Amish country popcorn came up as a match for my search.  My family loves popcorn so I thought I would try it.  I love this popcorn.  They a little pieces of popcorn.  They are almost hull free, which is something I really like.  The popcorn kernels are fresh!  I will be purchasing more of this product!"
1,"I still had the same amount of unpopped seeds in my microwave popper.  however, the taste is super. I enjoy the hulless 100% better and will continue to purchase."
1,"I got the combo starter pack. Flavor is good with all of the varieties, but they have their pros and cons. Baby White are very tiny and a bit hard to eat with fingers, so I ended up using a big spoon to eat (also too many unpopped kernels).  Gourmet red IS less hulls, but a bit larger than Baby White, but still too small for my tastes, but it DOES have great flavor. Gourmet White medium is an excellent choice, pops well, crunchy, flavorful, easy to pick up. My Favorite is Purple Popcorn with good sized kernels, nutty flavor almost, tender, perfection and looks good in the bowl (not that it matters).  All of their popcorn is grown so much better than conventional popcorn - no doubt due to their old-fashioned ways of farming.... thank you Amish Community for being this way. No more Jolly Time or Orville's for me.  My only negative review is that glass corn popper device they sell, does not work well in microwaves... too many un-popped kernels and if you put too much it'll burn real easy and ya end up with a very stinky microwave and kitchen UGH!  IF they know how to make it work, give very detailed instructions or discontinue."
1,Received this set as a gift and they are a wonderful tasting product.  Perfect for my West Bend popcorn maker.
1,"This popcorn is sweeter and more flavorful than the cheapo brand we used to buy at the store. I'm hooked. My favorite is the purple, but I usually mix all three together and that's just as good. Tastes excellent and is healthy when cooked in expeller pressed coconut oil."
1,"I love popcorn and eat it almost everyday. Great source of fiber and low in calories. I never had Amish popcorn before, so when I ordered the popper, this was recommended. Will be ordering more and different kinds."
1,"I got this as a small gift for my girlfriend who was always forgetting to buy more cheap popcorn at the store. I thought she would enjoy some unique and gourmet popcorn and I was right - she really liked them, especially the purple kind. We cook it on the stove with oil and it worked perfectly. However, don't be an idiot like me and splash oil all over your face! Does NOT feel good. Popcorn has a great, distinct flavor and I think we will be returning for more."
1,It was a Christmas gift and the recipients were very happy to receive it.  It also came in a timely manner.  Thanks.
0,When I bought my popcorn popper I figured I'd try this popcorn just to see how it was.  Please dont waste your money on this stuff.  The colonels were very very small and tough.  I thought maybe since it was my first time using it  wud try it again in case it was me with a new popper....and again it was awful.  Threw the popped popcorn out and even the birds wudnt eat it....
0,I purchased an airpop popcorn maker.  This is a small kernal popcorn that did poorly in the machine.  Kernals were flying out and many didn't pop.
0,"I was ripped off! Promised a superior product. I purchased the medium yellow, small kernals, lots unpopped, flavor: below average, texture: odd sandy. would love to get my money back for this obvious tourist trap crap."
0,I was looking forward to the popcorn and was disappointed it never arrived.  Possibly it is back ordered.  Hoping to have fresh pop corn soon.
0,not at all worth the cost...purchased a great hot air popper and used this corn in it...tried all three varieties with same results...popcorn was stale and tasteless...using Orville from now on.
1,This was a very nice gift for my mother and father in law. They really enjoyed it!
1,"If you ever go to an Indian restaurant with me, order your own papadams (English spellings vary). Once these delicious wafers get to the table, I suddenly become sharing-impaired.<br /><br />You've certainly seen them at Indian restaurants. They're the saucer-sized crispy wafers. Thin, crunchy, and often seasoned with big flavors (black pepper, cumin, garlic, or chilis, to name a few), these call to mind some Western crispy snacks, all of which pale in comparison. Made with bean flour, these offer a bit of protein with their crunch, but without a bean-y flavor. And, if it matters, you don't have to be a chemist to pronounce any of the ingredients.<br /><br />I've had a few flavors in the Lijjat line, including plain. I've had other brands, too, but this is the one I keep coming back to. These can be cooked many ways, including frying or toasting over an open flame - but a stack of three in the microwave for a minute come out very nearly as good, and with fewer calories than you might expect. Each package contains about 15 wafers, so the 20-pack is only for large families or the truly fanatical. If you can't get to an Indian grocer, though, consider splitting with some friends. They'd better be good friends, though, because sharing is a real problem.<br /><br />-- wiredweird"
1,"These are the best brand of poppadoms, and I have tried many. I am in a rural area and recently unable to find them in the local stores. I even watched a video on how to make poppadoms. Living in Florida, I knew the sun-dried aspect was obtainable. But as it is winter, I decided to wait until summer before attempting this.<br />Not wanting to wait until summer to have poppadoms with curry, I went back to searching online. As they are called many things by many different people, I now search for poppadom (yes, many different spellings), udad, papad. I was really happy to find these on Amazon.<br />These are fresh and ""bendy"", unlike the more famous brands which are truly brittle and dried out. I can almost see these by Lijjat being sun dried a few weeks before I use them. After cooking, they are larger, lighter and more crisp than the usual poppadoms, and taste wonderful.<br />I may never try to make my own, as these are probably much better than I could ever make."
1,"Lijjat Papad is the only brand I trust to consistently perform well for me. I tend to roast mine over an open flame (god bless gas stoves!), but my sister-in-law likes to do hers in the microwave. It's the papad that my mother bought in India, and it's the one that I buy in New York. We're trying to watch our weight, so these are a much tastier, lower fat, higher nutrition, version of potato crisps that you see in the stores all the time.<br /><br />Like the other reviewer, I have a tough time sharing these, so the 20 pack isn't unreasonable for me. Think about it: you have a snack that's ready in seconds, and can be eaten with pickles, with chutneys, with meals, or all by itself. AND it's not dripping with fat. I have a lot of friends over, so I tend to run through papad fairly quickly."
0,We ordered the twenty pack and split it with another household.  No one could eat them.  They tasted like plastic.  We tried several from a few different packages and had the same results.
1,"This stuff is great, my kids love it!  No artificial colors, flavors, no sugar, and no harmful chemicals like the blue stuff, pink stuff, or yellow stuff.<br /><br />You have to know how to do it right though!<br /><br />First off, use about half of what they suggest.  You can always add more later if you want more, but with Stevia if you use too much it will taste bitter.  Some flavors require more than 1/2 strength.  With orange for example I use their recommended amounts, but the other flavors are anywhere from 1/2 to 2/3 the recommended amounts.  Always start with less and add more until it tasts right for you.<br /><br />Secondly, it takes a long time for it to dissolve.  Mix it in and let it sit for at least 10 minutes before trying any, and really it is best after sitting in the fridge overnight.  If you just dump some in the top and take a drink you will be VERY disappointed as it will clump and just sit there.<br /><br />We use a dispensing refrigerator container so the kids can serve themselves.  I make 5L at a time, one of each flavor and it is always a hit."
1,"OK, I know, I know, I know . . . drink more water.  Only problem is . . . I hate water.  This solves my problem.  Natural sweeteners without any sugar. No artificial colors. The light strawberry flavor is like cotton candy if you use a little less mix than recommended. I love it. I actually look forward to drinking this at the office all day. Makes my water a lovely pale pink (sort of like pink lemonade) that makes every one ask ""what are you drinking?"""
1,This product is pretty delicious.  I love using stevia instead of other fake sugars because it's a natural product and seems less likely to cause cancer.  I wish more things would use it instead!
1,So far I've only tried it in plain yogurt and it was AMAZING!!!  It was very strawberry tasting and just the right amount of sweet.  I started slowly by only putting in half the recommended and then added in a little more.  It is a little strong so start low and add to your desired taste.  :)
1,"i like the strawberry, lime, and cherry, but i think i like the strawberry best.  This drink solves my problem of getting enough fluids, and aside from coffee i don't drink anything else anymore.  Take the suggestions other positive reviewers have done - let it dissolve (I shake the container), and DON'T USE TOO MUCH POWDER!  It is delicious if you get the quantity right - just use a measuring spoon."
1,"We recently got this product, not knowing what to expect.  If you like flavored waters, than this is the stuff for you.  You're not really going to get a kool-aid type of beverage from it.  I have a quart sized water bottle, and I put in about 1/4 tsp of the product then add water.  I don't have the clumping issue, because I shake my water bottle.  I get a nice drink that isn't too sweet and is refreshing.  I'm going to try other flavors too. =)"
1,"I would have given this product a 2 star.  The taste is not that good... so it gets a 2* for flavor.  However, the health value is tremendous.  For people with diabetese, this is a miracle.<br /><br />What is nice about the flavor is that it is NOT overpowering.  Therefore, if you want to add you own flavoring to it... I suggest something like unsweetened kool aid... or something like it that is healthier.<br /><br />This product has a great potential and it's health benefits are superb!"
1,"This product is delicious, not to mention all-natural, and I use it almost every single day.  I mix it into plain yogurt and it makes it downright addictive. I'm slowly collecting all the flavors of Stevita (I only wish there were more!!) and this one might just be my favorite; it's the perfect balance of sweetness and authentic strawberry flavor!"
1,This product has a great flavor and it even has vitamin C in it.  Most water flavorings don't offer that except Propel; and propel has artificial sweetener in it.  I prefer using Stevia products because they have no chemicals in it.  The only problem I had was with it dissolving in really cold water.
1,"For someone who is trying to slowly switch over from regular diet sodas/drinks to all natural diet substitutes, I have tried a variety of stevia flavored drinks (aka stevia sweetened sodas and teas). This my first time trying a powdered drink. And it's better than what I expected. I was bit wary after reading some of the reviews. You can add just a little bit and it's enough to sweeten my tea or just water. I am not a fan of drinking water (except fiji or while working out) and this can easily quench my thirst when I add the right amount. If I add too much its a mix between bitter and sweet and it's not that good. It's something I add for flavour and a great alternative for a healthy diet nut who likes tasty drinks. I would like to try the orange so I can add it to tea and make it DIY iced orange tea."
0,"I really hoped that this would be good for milk and yogurt like Quik or Hersheys syrup, but sadly, it is not.<br /> Being a newly minted diabetic, I am<br />very limited on things I can have, that of course, I used to love.<br />Like Strawberry Ice Cream, or a Strawberry shake. I had hope that this product<br />with Stevia would be a good alternative.<br />I am afraid however that this stuff tastes nothing like strawberry at all, frankly I am not sure what it<br />tastes like.<br /><br />I ordered this after I had purchased their Chocolate product, which is AMAZING.<br />I loved it so much I had just assumed the strawberry would be<br />just as good, so much so I had bought 2 containers of it.<br /> Well, you live and you learn. Will I buy it again? not a chance. Will I buy the Chocolate<br />stevita again? darn right I will.<br />That stuff tastes great in skim milk, and that greek zero fat yogurt ( which I can have ) and makes that stuff taste<br />fantastic.<br /><br />So. Strawberry Sevita NO.<br />Chocolate Sevita YES YES YES.<br /><br />As usual, taste is an personal thing, and you might like the strawberry stuff, so Your Milage May Vary."
0,"I will start by saying I love stevia! I have used it for years in just about every form there is (powder, liquid, packets, teas, etc) so I do understand it's taste and concentration. Unfortunately, this stuff just taste nasty no matter how you mix it! I've tried using less, I've tried using more, nothing helps. So far, I have only tried the strawberry so I'm hoping other flavors are better, but this one is just not drinkable, sorry."
0,"Do they test their product before selling it? This wont dissolve, it lumps up into chunks on top. Total waste of money."
1,"My local grocers quit carrying this product AFTER I had already developed an affinity for it. It's quick, easy, tasty, and if you put it together with a package of ramen noodles you have a meal in a snap! I work a lot of hours and I greatly value resources that put a meal in front of me with a minimum of hassle and adequate value. This hits the spot! Thanks Kikkoman, thanks Amazon!"
1,This is an outstanding product that I add to and makes the best Hot and Sour soup going
1,"This Hot and Sour soup is excellent! We like to enhance it some with a little extra spice (habanero powder), some firm tofu, chinese dried black mushrooms, egg and scallions."
1,"This soup is so light and filling at the same time and has a wonderful flavor that is balanced with just the right amount of hot and sour. It is not overbearing on either side that would leave you wanting more of the hot or more of the sour, it is very delicious."
1,"This makes a tasty, low-calorie soup.  I often add extra vegetables and even a few noodles. Love this product."
1,"This is a Kikkoman product and the quality is apparent.  Quick and easy to make and very tasty, certainly as good as or better than I've had at most Asian restaurants.  I like to add crushed Tien Tsin peppers to give it a little more kick."
1,"This is the best hot and sour soup mix we have ever found.  We add a few sliced mushrooms, and often a little pork and/or seafood, and it's nothing short of wonderful."
1,"I love this soup!  And my grocery store stopped carrying it, so I am very grateful that I can order it here, and have it shipped to my home!  It arrives in perfect order, right on time every time!  TY TY TY"
1,"I love this soup, I used to be able to buy it at Walmart and then they discontinued selling it. So thanks to Amazon I can still get my soup."
1,"After buying this product for under $1.50 each, I cannot see paying that price. It's a good soup mix ,,,But not $3.41 good."
1,"I was really tired of going through all of the recalls & not knowing if or when either my dog or myself was going to get sick! I have bought the best dog foods on the market literally and nothing even came close to making my very picky Australian Cattle Dog happy. Then a friend suggested that I try Annamaet.  The day I took it out of the mailbox, he started jumping up & down bumping the box with his nose - I figured that he was only trying to amuse me.  So, we did the usual routine: Take a little of the food put it in the bowl & see if I get the evil stare, bent ears and disgusted look as if to say ""Really, are you kidding me?"" Not this time! When he saw that I had some of that wonderful smelling food in my hand, he immediately sat down and barked - he actually ate it out of my hand. His coat is incredibly soft & shiny and he looks great.  Also, he does not shed or blow his coat hardly at all like a normal blue heeler. I can not say enough about this food - I only wish that there was a store that sold it in my state, but that's ok - I will continue to order through amazon."
0,"I am spoiled because I caught, marinated, smoked and packaged my own salmon in the NW for years. I ordered the small packages for stocking stuffers for the holidays. I live in Louisiana (although salmon do not migrate to the Gulf) these days but salmon can be purchased semi-fresh all season. Should have bought some fillets and smoked them myself. I do know why it so overpriced it is a very easy process and never had a bad batch.<br />This Alaska salmon I purchased is (without going into details) would make a nice pet treat or crab bait after sampling it...I would not give it as a gift. Nice, authentic style packaging...gives you a star. But I trust Amazon, however I do not believe it was sampled by anyone in QA.<br /><br />Jim Kansier<br />New Iberia, LA"
1,Super easy to make and the flavor is awesome!  We love the restaurant in Chicago and were happy to see this in the grocery store.  Love this!
1,"I am so happy to see these carried on Amazon. I have been buying them from my local health food store, but I am going to start buying them in bulk here.<br /><br />Let me start by saying that I buy very few processed foods. I make nearly everything from scratch including: pasta, bread, tortillas, crackers, ground meat, baked goods, marshmallows, etc. I feel like I have very high standards for grocery items. The only reason I even tried these was that I have a ton of respect for Rick Bayless. I have several of his cookbooks and I have enjoyed many awesome meals and learned a ton from them.<br /><br />Anyway I have tried 4-5 varieties of these pouches: the red enchilada, the green enchilada, the fajita, and the beef taco. All four of them blew me away! To the point where I actually wonder if I should even bother with making any of it from scratch anymore.<br /><br />Take my word for it.... these are totally worth the money! I will always keep them on hand."
1,My wife brought five different flavored. They are all excellent! We used the taco flavor last night and it is some of the best tacos we have made yet.
1,"If you love the flavor of toasted pecans, this coffee is for you.  Great flavor, good coffee taste.  It was very easy to brew the right strength. What a pleasure to wake up to the smell of toasted pecans and freshly brewed coffee! This is the second time I've purchased this coffee and I'll definitely do it again."
1,"Came upon Cameron's Coffee strickly by chance at a local store. Loved the flavor so later did an Internet search and found it on Amazon, PLUS it's available as a subscription. Talk about convenience!"
1,"This coffee will blow your hair straight back. Make sure to wear a ball cap while drinking. It's just that good. As with any coffee good drinking water is the key ingredient to perfecting a great cup of coffee. Hence, lousy water, lousy coffee. I try to stick with distilled water to make my coffee or invest in a good countertop water filter to at least get the lousy chlorine out of the water. But for those of you who are lucky enough to have excellent well water you probably won't have to bother with distilled or filtered water. Lucky you!!"
1,"I first saw this coffee at Amazon. I had never heard of Cameron's and this particular flavor sounded good. The aroma of the beans is wonderful. The aroma while brewing awakens me clear in the bedroom as its' set using the built in timer. My first cup and that was it ! Although I still like a strong dark French roast, this medium roasted Cameron's Toasted Southern Pecan is now my favorite brew. The Aroma and Flavor is GREAT ! I would like to try some other roast by Cameron's, but I can't seem to make a change since I like this soooo much ! Really good coffee ! I highly recommend !<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ESMUYK"">Cameron's Toasted Southern Pecan Whole Bean Coffee, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a>"
1,"Coffee arrived on time, was fresh and the value was good. I always use Amazon to purchase my specialty coffee."
1,"This is the only coffee I've bought for a few years.  I grind the beans myself and make it strong with a little half-and-half.  The flavoring is not necessarily noticeable, you might think that it is an unflavored coffee.  It tastes smooth and creamy, not bitter.  I prepare this coffee the same way when my parents visit and they ask, ""Why is your coffee so good?""  So I now give them bags of this coffee for gifts.  I prefer the whole-bean coffee, I think it tastes fresher."
0,"Too mild and I'm not sure that it tastes of pecans at all.  We ended up mixing with stronger dark beans to give it some heft, but that doesn't make me want this again.  The price is good (esp given the rising price of coffee beans), but we won't re-order this one."
1,"This coffee is fantastic and each cup makes me craving for more. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars - the smell is much less when the coffee is ready, the beans themselves smell much stronger and better. But over all it is pure pleaser and I am now a returning customer. We live in the Dominican Republic and when I first have ordered this coffee beans, my husband was very irritated, said - we live in the coffee republic, to order coffee via Internet is equal as to try selling snow to Greenland. But now he is the first one, who reminds me that our coffee stock is coming to an end and we need to order some more."
1,I don't like flavored coffee that has a strong taste.  This is extremely good with a mild pecan taste and a great smell.
1,"This coffee has enough real coffee taste to please real coffee drinkers and enough flavor to please those who only like flavors!  Simply put, one pot will please everyone in your house or at your party.  Great for every day or at a party; morning or dessert.  I love it and it is the only flavor I order now!  I am a bold/espresso drinker and my mom is a weak coffee drinker, but we can agree on this.  You won't be disappointed!"
0,"I figured this coffee would be great from seeing the good reviews. I'm starting to think they are from the company. I was looking for a good southern pecan coffee and this tastes nothing like pecans. It tastes like hazelnut. If I wanted hazelnut, I would buy it. The coffee itself tastes okay, but it doesn't taste how it should. I expected better from this company since I love their other flavors."
0,"I was unable to buy the particular brand of Southern Pecan coffee locally that I've bought for years so started researching on Amazon for a replacement.  Read the various customer reviews and this brand seemed to be the perfect choice.<br /><br />This is what I've found since purchasing it:  The coffee is very weak in flavor, watery in taste and........when you grind more coffee beans to compensate........it doesn't improve.  No creamy, rich flavor - not even close.<br /><br />For my money, I will never buy this coffee again.  It's just not worth it."
1,"believe all the 5-star reviews, this broth is restaurant quality...I'm thinking some restaurants are using this broth???<br /><br />Make sure you buy all the additions (greens, beef slices, bean sprouts, hot peppers, siracha, hoison sauce, etc...)<br /><br />Only thing I would modify is to add more water.  It's a little salty for my taste.  Water it down.  So, one package suggests 2 gallons of water...I would add an additional gallon of water.  Or whatever you like to get it just right.<br /><br />But it is awesome, it's got the aroma of Pho, it's semi-oily at the top of the broth...I mean...good, good, good!!!"
1,"I didn't know how to cook Pho & tried a few ways until I found this product. It made my cooking so fun & interesting as it's so easy to prepare a delicious bowl of Pho at home. ""My Pho"" was so delicious that my husband (American who came to VN regularly for business) wanted me to cook Pho 3 times/week until we both were fed up eating Pho :) Now we only cook Pho at home once/month or cook it for our American guests to introduce :)<br />Any way, I strongly believe you can save time & energy & will get compliments by using this product to cook Pho at home :)"
1,I have NEVER left a review for anything and have been buying stuff online for years. This soup base makes the most authentic and delicious pho! My family was amazed that it tasted exactly the same as our favorite restaurant. ****Use high quality beef-it makes all the difference!
1,"My wife and I have been trying to make Pho like the ones at the Vietnamese restaurant but no sucess.  When comes to Pho, I am very, very picky on how it should taste.  I've gone to many restaurants and even some of their pho does not meet my expectation....only a few select restaurants actually does.  First time I found VV Foods' Pho base was in an asian store.  Unfortunately, they don't always have it in stock.  I guess someone else found out the ""secret"" base as well.  I called up VV Foods and they said that I can order directly through them or through Amazon.  Best Pho base ever.  Even if you can't cook, this pho base will make you a pro."
1,This is the only way I make Pho!  All you need is the beef bones and add this soup base then you're all set.  This is even better than the restaurant.
1,I've been trying to make beef Pho at home for several months now with zero success. I finally did some extra searching when looking for some type of Pho base and found this. I read the reviews and ordered instantly.<br />It's so good. It's as good as our local restaurant. I followed some advice such as using less base so I made a gallon and used 4oz (5oz or half jar is what it calls for) or base and one spice packet. I let the spice packet boil for about an hour. I tasted it after the first boil as the instructions say but it didn't have as much flavor as I like.<br />My whole family loved it.<br />The only thing is I used rice stick noodles that weren't very good. I've tried thin rice noodles but those were about the same as the sticks. My local restaurant uses rice noodles that are very soft and look close to an angel hair pasta size. Maybe I'm not cooking the rice noodles long enough because they didn't get as soft as I like.
1,"Flavor of this broth was spot on!  I have been to many Vietnamese restaurants for this soup and the flavor was quite similar to this product.  My only complaint was that it was a bit too salty for my taste.  I added an extra quart of water to dillute but it was still too salty.  Next time, I may use a bit less of the beef base.  I would definately recommend this product."
1,"Yes! I don't have a pho restaurant anywhere near me.  This is the next best thing.  It truly has the pho flavor.  It comes with a jar of pho ""paste"" and two packets of seasoning.  I make two batches out of these and it makes a lot. I can also freeze any extra broth for later use.  I don't follow the directions regarding the onion and ginger.  I just simmer one seasoning packet for an hour to really pull out the spicy flavor, then I add half the paste mix.  Serve with the traditional pho ingredients.  YUM."
1,"I fell in love with Pho on the east coast and when I moved to Texas one of the saddest moments was realizing there was no Vietnamese restaurant. I could not even get some of the spices in the recipes I found online. I tried five different times to make it from scratch, or from other Asian mixes, etc. and failed miserably.<br /><br />THIS IS IT! It's perfect. It tastes JUST LIKE the Pho at Pho Vung Tau... a perfect broth. JUST GREAT. With beef, chicken, or seafood, and romaine, sprouts, rice noodles plus fish, hoisin, limes and srichia (sp?) sauce, it's amazing!! I introduced this dish to my neighbors and Texas family and they're all Pho addicts now too. Especially fun with sweet fish dip and Chun's shrimp spring rolls. :) Can't say enough how great this stuff is if you love Pho and want to have it at home.<br /><br />Did I mention this is VERY YUMMY???? I wish I could post a picture to show how incredibly *pretty* this broth is when it's completed - such a rich color with a great sheen.<br /><br />A-plus!"
0,"Altho this is a good pho base to make at home, however, the expiration is not visibly outside on the box but on the bottom of the jar inside the box.  I bought a couple of these from a local store and have been using them last week.  Just now I notice that they have expired three months ago.  I checked the box and see no dates so I made a call to VV Foods asking why expiration is not outside on the box instead.  The lady told me that the FDA's law that they have to have an expiration date stamped on the bottom or on the lid of the jar and not the outside packaging.  Also,  it's the store's responsibility to check and rotate the products.  She then educate me that consumers have the right to open the boxes to check on expiration dates and take back to store for refund if products expired.  Uh, each box contains 2 spice packages inside and for a customer to open the boxes up just to get a non-expired product would look very weird and even a waste of time.  And really made no sense at all.<br /><br />What if you buy from online because they're not available at local stores?  I don't think it would be a problem with Amazon to refund and/or resend but if it is Amazon's responsibility to open up the packaging to check for expiration dates before sending them to their customers would cause a problem in their shipping lines."
1,"Health concerns due to heaps of MSG and animal fats aside, this is one good tasting soup base that will last you for quite a while."
0,"when i first received this product, i was psyched.<br />but after making the broth then i realized there's tons of<br />msg enbedded in the paste. we had to down tons of water afterwards.<br />i will not purchase or recommend this product to anyone who enjoys<br />a flavorful bowl of pho."
1,"This is a very handy product that I always have on hand.  Price here is a little high, but if you do not have access to it from Costco Warehouse, then you should buy it here....Same product at Costco is sold for $3.99 each jar."
1,"Here's an item that we like keeping on the kitchen shelves. It's a 13.5 ounce plastic jar of Kirkland Signature Dried and Chopped onions. We usually use fresh onions wherever possible, but these fine-grained chopped onions lend themselves for using in meat balls, meat loaf, soups where the fine grain size is important and in a variety of dips. Nice taste. Easy to store. Long shelf life. Ours is now over the ""best by"" date, but the still work fine and I wouldn't think of throwing them out. It's a good, useful product to have around.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
1,"So glad to have dried onions grown in U.S.A.  For most purposes, I chop up fresh onions, but I like to have dried on hand.  These have excellent flavor."
1,"I regularly cook with onion, but don't always have the time or energy to dice fresh onions. This large container works out well. I put the onion into the cooking pot and get the desired flavor with no effort. The free shipping (Prime member) made the online purchase decision easy as well."
1,I have one lab and one beagle and they liked these rawhides. They are a good thickness and kept them busy for awhile. My dogs are 12 and 13 years old and they had no problems or issues with this product as another reviewer has stated (maybe a bad batch?). They finished an entire bag and I just ordered another.
0,Bad product.  Gave to my 2 Labs & Beagle 3 times over 3 days.  All 3 dogs threw up each time.  Trashed the rest of the bag.
1,"I'm not a fan of granola by any means: at least not until now. I have tried making my own on many occasions but the mess, expense, amount of ingredients to keep on hand and the less than satisfactory results have pretty much turned me off. I purchased this product in 3 flavors as a last ditch effort: Cherry Walnut, Almond and Maple Walnut. They arrived together in 2 days, well packaged, fresh and crunchy. Did I mention FLAVORFUL? I am a true convert. This is the best. While I like all 3, my favorite is the Maple Walnut, followed by the Almond and then Cherry Walnut (mostly because the huge dried cherries taste more like golden raisins than cherries, but still very good. I should also mention that while the dried cherries are about the size of the bowl of a teaspoon and look like they are soft and pliable, they are very hard and take a lot of careful chewing, after which they become sticky. I didn't find that texture pleasant). And when the ingredients listed walnuts or almonds, I figured it would be microscopic smooshed up pieces mixed in so small I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a sesame seed and a piece of walnut or almond.  BUT, the almonds are large pieces or whole almonds while the walnuts - well, the walnuts are planet-sized: sometimes 1/2 of an entire walnut and there are tons of them in a single bag of this granola. The maple walnut is the only one I find a bit on the sticky side, but not like caramel popcorn sticky-just a bit tacky. I've already used this in yogurt, cottage cheese, oatmeal, as a snack in mid afternoon, in salads, pancakes and yesterday morning, I made Bisquick biscuits and added some of all 3 flavors as an experiment. The biscuits were marvelous. Now, if I could only remember WHAT I did so I can make them again with the same success! Try this. I don't think you'll be disappointed. If you are, you can send it to me!! :)"
0,"Really liked the 10 flavor sour mix from Jelly Belly, but couldn't seem to find them locally anymore.  Now they are selling the sour mix as a 5 flavor mix.  Was concerned following the other review about beans sticking together, but decided it'd be worth it to have 10 flavors.  Box arrived and they were stuck together, but only 5 flavors.  A waste of my time.  Never would have ordered if product had been described correctly by the seller.  Just drive to the store and get the 5 flavor mix that's not already stuck together."
0,"This is a 5 flavor assortment, not the 10 flavor assortment. If your looking for the 10 flavor assortment as I was, DO NOT ORDER THIS!!! False advertising..."
1,I buy these for the office and put them in the candy machine from Brookstone.  The partners love them!
1,"yeah...<br />This came in as a package. Candies are in the paper board package without plastic bags or any sort of containers. Yes, I am still alive, and this is my second package. Everyone is calling me crazy for buying 10 pounds of candy, but for the quantity vs price...I think it's worth it."
1,"I ordered the Teisseire for making mai-tais after noticing that the Collins orgeat I had been using didn't even list almonds as an ingredient. When it came I had my family do a blind taste test for me. It actually tastes pretty similar to the Collins, both are sweet and taste like almonds. But the Teisseire has an additional nutty or earthy flavor that the Collins does not. It's made from almond extract, not just flavoring, and sugar, not corn syrup, and nothing with a scary chemical name.<br /><br />It does cost almost twice as much, plus shipping, but it takes me months to go through a bottle so it's worth it for me. It has a very nice pour spout that eliminates the crusty buildup you get on a screw-top bottle like Collins. My only complaint is the metal container. You can't see how much is left, and I think glass would be less likely to impart a taste. Right now there is no metallic taste at all, but in six months who knows?<br /><br />Note that the Amazon listing is wrong in a couple ways. The bottle is metal, not plastic, and the name is spelled ""Teisseire."" Yes, I know it looks plastic in the photo, but it really is metal shaped like that."
1,"As far as I can tell this is the only ""all natural"" orgeat available on Amazon.  Here are the ingredients: sugar, water, fructose, almond extract.  Great but how does it compare to the other orgeats?  The only other one I have on hand at the moment is from Fee Brothers.  The Fee Bro. while being pretty good does come across as more ""almond-like"" than just tasting like actual almonds.  It's almost too sharp.  The Fee Bro. orgeat does contain some orange flavor (again ""orange-like"" not actual orange).  Teisseire's orgeat  tastes like almonds and it comes through nicely in the cocktails I tried it with (Mai Tai and Japanese).  It doesn't have the orange or rose water that orgeats traditionally have but even without that it tastes better than Fee Brothers'.  The lack of orange water makes it 4 stars instead of 5."
0,"I recently purchased this orgeat, as well as two other orgeats available on Amazon: Monin and Ferrara. I tried them in various cocktails and Teisseire came in last--a distant last--in every test. Compared with the other two it is thin and its flavor is too weak to stand up to other ingredients in a drink. I do give it bonus points for the nice bottle and pour spout, but it's certainly not worth its price and I do not recommend it for cocktail enthusiasts."
1,"My dogs loved this Natural Balance stew!  And no wonder - I have never seen such appetizing looking dog food.  You read the ingredients and know it's good for them, but when you actually see it and serve it to your dog, it's amazing how tasty it looks!  Five stars!"
1,"These are good berries, and not hard like some. I put them in a ""trail mix"" with coaco nibs, nuts, seeds and other dried fruit. Very good!"
1,They came tighly sealed and in clean good shape. I found the flavor to be a mix between raspberries and raisins.
1,I bought these berries for help for the kidney.  They are a very rich berry that tastes like a wine-raisin berry.  They are wonderful.  Only five for a woman & 8 for a man.  THis is a helathy snack.
1,This plant was grown with the love and care only a lifelong green thumb and nursery person could manage
1,"I ordered the Stephanotis Variegata (Madagascar Jasmine Variegated) from<br />Emerald Goddess Gardens on September 24, 2012 and it arrived 4 days later on September 28.  The plant arrived in healthy condition in a 4"" plastic pot.<br /><br />It is a vine or stem attached to a bamboo stick and it is about 25"" tall.  It has 24 leaves which are medium/dark green with white edgings and occasional white patterns.  Leaves measure 2 1/2 "" to 3"" in length and about 1"" in width.<br /><br />It is very pleasing plant and a good sized one.<br /><br />~~~<br /><br />Here are general directions for growing as a houseplant in the North.<br /><br />1. Give bright light. Avoid strong sun. The light of early morning sun is fine.<br />2. Minimum temperature is 40 degrees.<br />3. Let the soil dry between waterings.<br />4. Flowers from May to September.<br />5. Avoid sudden temperature changes and cold drafts.<br />6. During winter, keep the soil on the dry side as the plant rests. Keep temperatures cool."
0,I liked it very much.I would give it five stars but when I got the pocky all of them were melted together and it was a mess!
1,"This pocky is amazing.  good service, fast shipping, and super fresh!!  very good  5 Stars!!<br /><br />Cory"
1,"I LOVE pocky. I think it's the best Snack food.<br />I won't say it's perfect, though. It's quite expensive for little sticks with flavouring, but it's really tasty.<br />I'm not going to lie. If you do not have a taste for them... They'll probably taste like sawdust. But I've only met two people who thought that, and everyone I know eats pocky but my mom. All my friends, my brother, sister, and even my dad all like pocky.<br />I just demoloished a package. I'm thinking I need more."
0,"I bought these ""treats"" for my son because he had read so much about them and I am glad I only bought one, they pretty much tasted awful."
1,The size was great! We were not sure about how it worked until we saw it used the regular size pez candy. The base is a little to thin for the size of the dispenser. The seller sent it just in time to make it in the Easter basket for our son.He was so shocked!
0,Though it shows 5 different flavors our bag only really had 3. I ate one that had the taste of pine sol. Really disappointed with the purchase.
1,I enjoyed my recent purchase very much.  The taffy was exactly what I hoped for.  Thank you.
0,"was stuck to bag and each other all flavors taste the same.. like plastic.. very upset.. taffy town is way better. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026ECPB0"">Taffy Town ~ Assorted Salt Water Taffy ~ 1lb</a>"
0,"I received the package with melted pieces, some that weren't all the way wrapped, and almost all chocolate and bananna. The plastic bag they were in, inside the box was ripped open.  I was so dissappointed, salt water taffy is a favorite treat! I suppose that's what I get for ordering it online."
1,I enjoyed all the different flavors of the salt water taffy and not expense at all. Just order this item in the cold months.
0,While I'll admit some flavors tasted good. They were all stale. And half the flavors were completely bland. Waste of money.
1,"Certainly the best blend available. Far superior to the ground, dry product being sold. Makes the best shrimp curry imaginable."
1,"Not bad but could use a little more buttermilk tang and definitely needs a pinch of salt.  Very versatile, too."
1,"Best mix for buttermilk biscuits I've ever found. easy to make, and does the job. As close as I can get to my great grandmna's home made biscuits."
1,"Jiffy mix has been around forever, and the biscuits are a big favorite. I absolutely love Jiffy biscuits and dumplings; they always come out light, moist, and tasty, with nothing extra but water. Jiffy tops Bisquick, hands down!"
1,"We have a favorite cookie in this house (from England) called Jaffa Cakes. It is a soft cookie with orange jelly in the middle and a dark chocolate topping. The best part of it is the jelly and chocolate.<br /><br />So when we came across these, we were in heaven. The best of Jaffa Cakes and available locally!<br /><br />The middle is an orange flavored jelly and the outside is a dark chocolate coating. They are not super sweet but that's what makes them tasty. They are semi-tart orange with the deep flavor of the chocolate. A perfect combination.<br /><br />The chocolate can look cloudy or scuffed when taken out of the bag but I believe it's because they get tossed around inside. If you want a perfect chocolate finish, you have to buy them individually packed.<br /><br />I picked up a 2 lb bag at BJs for $10."
1,"Never mind a candy bar for a treat, this tea is delicious. Smooth and satisfying, a favorite with the family."
1,"My older sister got me this brand of chai for Christmas, because I've been hunting for something that was somewhat like the Starbucks chai tea latte. I've tried everything from the Tazo chai that they sell IN Starbucks to different recommended home recipes. Well, this beats the Starbucks brand by a long shot. A little bit of a hassle to get a hold of, but definitely worth buying. Love it, I've already gone through three tins or so."
1,"I'm not here to bs anyone.  This Tropical Fruit Salad from Roland is absolutely the best i've had in a long time.  I'm still trying to figure out how it's not soggy at all.  It's canned, yet so fresh as if you just cut up the Fruit and served it.  Buy this and try it.  You won't be sorry."
1,"Vegan. Natural. Firm, refreshing chunks of tropical fruit packed in a light syrup with passion fruit juice, which is a treat in itself. Not overly sweet or thick or heavy. A great choice for enjoying the benefits of tropical fruit year-round. Made with yellow papaya, red papaya, pineapple, guava, sugar, & passion fruit juice. 210 calories per can. Product of Thailand. Highly recommended. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews and the vegancompassion Profile for more great choices. Check out ""Vegan Grocery Favorites"" and ""Vegan Grocery Top Ten"" & all the other helpful ""Vegan Grocery"" Listmania. Your input counts and will be greatly appreciated to benefit the search of others. Thank you."
1,"The pieces of fruit were ripe, flavorful, firm, not ""water logged"" and mushy like some canned fruit I've tried. The light syrup is only fruit juice, not the typical light or heavy corn syrup which I was quite grateful to find. The reason I did not give 5 stars is there is an approximate 65 to 35 ratio of fruit to juice. It is listed as 4 servings, but it was one cereal sized bowl for me, including juice. Granted I should have made it 2 servings considering the calories, but to make 4 servings you would need to use the small custard bowls which would not satiate me. I wish they had an organic version (yes, I've tried Native Forrest and I thought it was mushy). I will reorder until I find another organic version I like. I have bought other Roland organic and non-organic products that I have enjoyed, so I consider this brand trustworthy."
1,"If you want a fruit salad that tastes like you've just chopped it, this is what you need to buy.  I bought a case for my husband when he was ill and he ate a can a day for months.  If you want to make it a light meal, just add almonds, pecans or walnuts and some orange and grapefruit slices and place on a bed of spinach.  I made a very light topper with sour cream, sugar free whipped cream, a little of the juice from the can and a tiny bit of nutmeg.  This can be adjusted to taste.  If you ever order this, you will order over and over and never get tired of the fresh taste."
0,If you just want fruit and or can't afford the high cost of fresh fruit this is ok. It's packed with large size pieces of fruit.
1,This is a great snack for Type 2 diabetes people. I carry them in my purse for a protein pick me up when on the go....Planters uses sea salt and it has the heart healthy seal so you can't go wrong. Planters is a name to be trusted.
1,"These are great, healthy, grab and go packs of nuts.  I'm a almond and pecan fan; these are a lot woodier or nuttier than I'm used to, and a little dry.  However, it's good to mix it up every once in a while.  These are about twice the size of a ""100 calorie pack"".  The variety inside each pack is ok, seems a little peanut and hazelnut heavy though.  I'm glad I tried this, but will not be purchasing again.  I'm going for the 100 calorie almond packs instead.  Good packaging, great to grab and go, just not my cup of tea."
0,"First off, I love these things.  They taste great and each bag contains just enough to satisfy.<br /><br />However, my latest purchase consisted of only 12 bags per box - not 18 (so I'm paying a whole lot more for 30% less than when I originally bought these).<br /><br />Please be aware of this before you buy."
0,"The ""Nuts to Go"" package is very convenient and somewhat healthy, however, the ratio of Peanuts is too high compared with the other varieties in the package. Also peanuts are a ""Legume"". It would be nice to have more of the other varieties of ""nuts."""
1,"I've been feeding my dog Evolution for a couple years now. I wasn't sure if it was a good idea at first, but my veganism made me do it! If there had been any adverse effects, I would've taken her off right away. I'm not going to subject my dog to my own moralism if it does her harm. The first thing I noticed was that she dove right into her new kibble, so it passed the taste test. Of course, I slowly transitioned her from her other food. As time passed, it seemed that 2 cups total of dry food per day were enough to maintain her weight. I suppose this implies Evolution is very concentrated? She averages between 60-63 lbs throughout the year. I feed her only once in the evening, adding enough water to the kibble to make it stewy. Instead of giving her treats, I merely give her a small handful of kibble out of the two cup total once or twice a day. My dog is now twelve going on thirteen and just passed her senior checkup (blood work, stool and urine check, etc) with flying colors. I don't dare tell the vet what I've been up to. I don't think she'd approve. I let the checkups speak for themselves."
1,"My dogs have been eating Evolution for about the past 5 years. People always remark about how gorgeous their coats are and ask me what I do, that I must brush them and bathe them all the time. I do neither. People also can't believe my older dog is 9 because she looks and acts so young. They still love the food after all this time. I usually mix in a little canned, which Evolution also sells. The only thing I wish for that could improve it would be for it to be organic."
1,"I have 2 Chihuahuas - The first one I got as a puppy 9 years ago and the second one I got from a rescue a few years ago when she was already 7 years old.  I started feeding Evolution to my first dog at least 6-7 years ago when I first found out about it.  I've been a vegetarian for 10 years, so I wanted a healthy option for my dog, too! :-)  It disgusts me to know what ingredients are in other dog foods, and I can't fathom feeding that to my dogs.  My theory is if I wouldn't consider eating it, why would I feed it to my dogs?<br /><br />My first dog has always had a smooth shiny coat that gets many compliments from vets and others, she never smells bad or ""dog-like"", and her breath is never bad.  It actually smells good.  I attribute all that to Evolution.  Being 9 years old, she still acts like a puppy.  She is full of energy and very healthy.<br /><br />My second dog, when we first got her, was smelly and her coat was very rough.  Since she switched to Evolution, all that has changed.  She doesn't smell bad, neither does her breath, and her coat has gotten much softer and healthier-looking.  Now only if Evolution could stop her from shedding... :-)<br /><br />Overall - I'm expecting that my dogs will live happy and healthy lives from eating Evolution pet food, and I'm so glad this product is available!"
1,My pets (2 Dog and 2 Cats) have been on Evolution Diet for 8 years. Both my dogs and my cats love the food and have been on it since they were 4 months old. My younger cat was very sick when I brought her home and I was nervous about putting her on a vegei diet until she was well. My Vet uses this product and recommended that I switch right away because it's such a high quality food. Once I put her on Evolution she had a speedy recovery. Everyone that has had contact with my pets have made comments on how beautiful their fur is.
1,"This is a very healthy dog food.  There are no by-products in this food.  It is vegetarian and it is very healthy for dogs.  I personally think dogs will live longer by eating this type of food.  In fact, Evolution company has testimonials from owners about how the dogs actually live longer and are healthier. If you love your dog, get this food.  You and and your dog won't regret it. When dogs eat this food after a period of a week or two, I have seen a major difference in the softness and shine of their coat.<br /><br />Peace and Happiness,<br /><br />Patrick Leonardi"
1,I was worried my dog wouldn't like the taste of this food because it doesn't have meat.  But he seems to really enjoy it.
1,HEALTHIEST VEGETARIAN DRY DOG FOOD WITH GREAT NUTRITION!  I am so glad I found this dog food online.
1,"I feed my cat and dogs the vegan kibble from Evolution. It really is a great product and I add it to my own homemade vegan dog and cat food or if I am traveling it's great for on the go! My dogs and cat really love this kibble, and their health is so much better for it."
1,"Sometimes I think my dog eats the best food in the house.<br /><br />My dog is over 10 years old, she acts like she's half her age and her coat is beautiful and glossy. She has eaten this dog food for almost all her life and I attribute this dog food to taking such good care of her.<br /><br />For the price, you get a lot - it actually works out to be cheaper than any other vegetarian dog food on the market that I've found.<br /><br />It's just the best dog food. Every dog deserves to feel good :)<br /><br />Bon Apetit, doggie!"
1,"Purchased food on a referral by another dog-owner who's dog suffers from IBD.  Good stuff, smells like tomato.  I find the soaking period a bit of an inconvience, but probably worth the preplanning.  Haven't had any problem feeding to my 4 dogs.  Dogs look healthy, good appetite, but didn't fix the IBD unfortunately."
1,"I have been feeding my three dogs Evalution diet for five years now.  I pre make a batch mixed with different vegetables and sometimes cooked turkey meat, and keep it in the fridge for the week. (This way the rest of my family can feed the dogs if I'm not home! )"
1,"This Indian Pudding brings me back to my childhood in Boston.  It is delicious, has a wonderful texture, and is a most satisfying dessert.  My compliments to the chef!"
1,This product used to be carried by the Vermont Country Store.  We are grateful to be able to order this product on Amazon.  This product is well made and fun to used during the Holiday season.
1,"if you can't make it to durgan park or your fav restaurant that serves up great indian pudding this is a pretty<br />good alternative.  just warm, add vanilla ice cream or whipped cream and serve.  a great at home treat."
1,"Living 3,000 miles from NH I appreciate a taste of home, particularly in Dec.  The pudding was very good-better than I can make. Carried me back to Durgan Park. Thanks."
0,"I love indian pudding, but this was the worst that I have ever tasted. Half of the the cans were badly dented from their packing case. This is a lousy  product. I tried two cans and then threw the other nine cans away<br /><br />This is the first and last time that I will buy anything fron amazon."
1,The minute I tried this I was instantly hooked. The sad part though is just how difficult it's become to finding it. Lucky's had quit carrying it and Costco promptly followed their lead. As of now I'm restricted to purchasing it from Whole Foods or here on Amazon - why?!
0,"i am a fan of the tassimo machine, and many of the t-discs.  however the signature blend should be retitled the signature bland.  perhaps i just look a fuller bodied coffee particularly in the morning, but this one was exceptionally disappointing to me... take note of the different roast levels posted on tassimos website before buying discs that cost about $.50-$.75 per cup..."
1,"Try the Tasimo coffee maker and the T-Discs and you will love it! The selections of coffees and creamers, and the great service you receive from Amazon is fast and stays up to date with each delivery. Thanks Amazon!!"
1,"If you've ever ate it..You know..I've had it sent to Korea, Iraq, Afghanistan, and a few other places..It's always the best..Crush up crackers in the chili to make it like the restaurant."
1,"PROS:<br />Akmak crackers are the all-time champion with peanut butter.  In fact, Akmak are what graham crackers want to be when they grow up.  Delightfully crispy, slightly sweet whole grain goodness beyond compare.<br /><br />CONS:<br />This non-retail packaging sucks.  The packaging is two little crackers per package, just like you would get at restaurant. At least half of our crackers were smashed.<br /><br />We bought these through Amazon because the only place that sells these locally is Trader Joe's, which is about 30 miles away.  If the retail packaging is available, buy them that way, otherwise enjoy your crumbs!"
1,"A friend had been getting these Ak-mak crackers served to her at Whole Foods with a soup she would order for lunch.  She wanted to buy some but Whole Foods told her they were not for sale.  Being a somewhat resourceful person, I got on the internet and found that I could order them through Amazon.  They are very nutricious and  taste wonderful.  Thanks again to Amazon for coming through for me.  My friend is happy to find her crackers and I am happy to find a new nourishing cracker for myself.  June Dunaphant"
0,The Akmak crackers in the carton we received were not as fresh as they are when bought at a store and wrapped in individual packages.
1,I was putting together breakfast bags for the homeless and ordered Ak-Mak crackers along with Barney Almond Butter individual packets and other items. My goal was to give these folks something wholesome and nutritious with some fiber -- which people who eat on the run rarely get enough of. The crackers are tasty. I love the sesame seeds and robust crunch. The broken crackers (there are a few out of the 180 2-cracker packets in the box) taste great in the chili I'm eating for dinner tonight. Highly recommended.
0,I had tried this craxker in a snack pack at Starbucks...well they must have a special cracker mad just for them..cuz these were yuccky..yes i own a huge box of nasty crackers..even took them to work where people will eat anything..cant give them away..oops
1,"I love this tea.  Never bitter if you brew it correctly--I let boiling water sit 3 minutes, then brew tea 40 seconds.  I get two steepings that are equally delicious.  I'm sensitive to tanins, and this tea doesn't cause a reaction.  It's delicious.  Almost a floral aftertaste."
1,"I heard that this genmai cha tea had won an award, so I tried it. Aroma coming from the tea is fantastic. The tea is smooth and has an excellent brown rice taste. This is wonderful genmai cha tea. I will keep buying for more and try other teas from this company as well!"
1,"The taste of this tea is excellent.  I like to make my tea loose without using tea bags and this tea great for that.  There are extremely few leaf steams compared to other genmaicha teas I've tried in the past.  I don't like having to pick them out, so being able to make a few cups and not see one makes me very happy. It also has a stronger green tea taste than roasted rice, which I prefer.  Considering how long 1.1 lbs of tea will last me, I find it to be a great deal for its high quality."
1,I have tried several brands and this one is the best. Great deal when you buy the bag instead of the can and the quality is the same.I steep it for under a minute.
1,"My family and several friends have benefited from daily use of this tea. I can't say it ""cures"" cancer....but I have personally seen very positive results in a young boy who was literally being eaten up with numerous tumors...in the brain, spine and legs. After numerous surgeries to remove what tumors that could be safely operated on, the boy's doctors felt they could do no more and advised the family it was ""only a matter of a few months"" before some would grow back or others grow bigger. Family members knew of others who were currently using this tea, and optimistically got the boy started on a daily regimen of drinking (3 oz) twice daily.  The boy's surgeries were done in 2006/2007. Today the boy is doing well,has returned to school part time, is walking again(after surgeries he was wheelchair bound), and is slowly regaining his health. Progress is slow, but it's progress. The tumors have not returned or grown, in fact the remaining ones are slowly shrinking. So, who knows?<br />A side benefit that I personally saw as well as they boy mentioned above, is the results I saw in my own father who had emphysema/asthma.  His nighttime breathing was extremely noisy, worse than snoring.  Within about 2 weeks of drinking this tea, my mother woke in a panic one night because it was so silent in their bedroom.  She thought my father had stopped breathing.  Not so.  His breathing had silenced down to normal and even during the day his breathing was much easier and quieter.<br />So, does it help?  You decide.  Does it hurt?  Not at all.  And, it tastes similar to alfalfa tea, so it's easy to take.<br />You can find better prices than the one here, though. Check [...]  for other outlets.<br />This is where the herbs are grown:[...]<br />Learn more about the developer of the tea:[...]  CAVEAT: When I contacted this site to ask about buying the tea, they are selling exactly what the nurse who developed it said NOT to drink....a serum/drops or a brew already made up. They are trying to sell it as a 3 week ""treatment"" for a very exorbitant price.  Not at all what the nurse intended.  So BEWARE!"
1,"I can't believe that no one has ever reviewed the magical Flower Of The Ocean sea salt.  I say magical, because I never believed that salt could so powerfully transform food the way that this Celtic Sea Salt does for me.  I've been using it for a few years because a couple of my friends were using it after seeing a nutritionist who highly recommended it.  I think this is because it is much higher in minerals and other trace elements from the ocean.  I use it while cooking as well as sprinkling on top of food when it is ready to be eaten.  I just roasted some organic beets.  I sprayed them with olive oil and then sprinkled the salt on top and it truly tasted different than when I used to make this with regular table salt.  There is a definite flavour to this salt that is hard to describe.  That is why I call it magic."
1,It's hard to find good smokehouse bacon.  This one fits the bill.  Cook over low heat to avoid burning.
1,I use the hazelnut flavor to make  my own coffee syrup.  It smells great and tastes great.  It's does a great job  of saving me money on the syrup I was purchasing at my favorite coffee shop.
1,"I really like hazelnut flavored creamers, but I find them too sweet.  I use this extract to make my own sugar-free creamer (with fat free half and half) and it works well."
0,"I have a great amount of experience with water kefir; have been producing it at home for many years and enjoying the great health benefits gained from drinking it daily.  I wanted to share this experience with a friend and thought to bring DEHYDRATED grains with me on a visit to get her started.  I did not want to travel a lond distance with wet grains (I could have shared my own) and thought it would be easier to bring them dried.  The product description here states that they are dehydrated grains...NOT true.  What I received was a padded manila envelope, a ziploc baggy with about 1 to 2 teaspoons of some very badly crushed, wet grains (looked like they got squished by the postage cancelling machine used by the Post Office), and a photocopy of instructions.  Not as described or pictured in this listing.  The grains smelled bad and so far, have not been able to produce good quality kefir.  Who is the product manufacturer...Real Man of Genius? It is most certainly not Cultures for Health as pictured.<br /><br /> ""Each Packet of Water Kefir Starter Culture Contains: 2 teaspoons Live active water kefir culture in a dehydrated state (will rehydrate to 3-4 tablespoons of water kefir grains; sufficient to yield 2-3 quarts of water kefir every 24-48 hours). For additional information on this product, please contact the manufacturer."""
0,"I contacted the people at Cultures for Health and asked about real-man-of-genius. I was told that real-man-of-genius is NOT Cultures for Health and that it is not even their product. This is a man in Kentucky who uses their picture on Amazon to promote his kefir grains. He sends about 1/2 the amount that Cultures for Health does, packaged in a ziplock bag."
0,"I bought this particular water kefir because I had spoken to and watched the video from Cultures for Health.  This company is using their logo, but it is NOT from Cultures for Health! It came from another company in a different state.  I emailed CFH to tell them about this impostor and they were aware of it.  Why is Amazon allowing this? Anyway the grains were not dehydrated and there was not a sufficient amount (in my opinion) to get good kefir. I do not appreciate their false advertising. AMAZON, check this out!"
1,"Ordering live grains (or anything else ""live"") online was a new experience.  I only hoped they would grow and produce a fine product; some of the reviews made me wonder.  Now that I've been using them for several weeks I am so pleased.  Since our milk kefir grew prodigiously I expected the same from the water grains.  When they didn't, I contacted the seller who personally answered questions, gave very detailed instructions, wanted feedback, and was very helpful.  For instance, the water kefir wants warmth -- a heating pad on the lowest setting works perfectly -- do not let the water get cold and I had done that. The process may take several days, longer than I thought -- using the taste test(often 5-6 days for our liking)works every time!  At this point I am able to keep two jars going; patience has been rewarded. Adding fruit, as apricots or strawberries, during or after gives a delicate and delicious flavor. The grains thrive and multiply, giving us a healthy and tasty beverage that also makes great smoothies.  Our thanks!  Kudos to the seller for excellent service and delivering a fine product."
0,I didnt realize the return date had just expired otherwise I would be returning these which I dont normally do. I was expecting these grains to make fizzy water and all I am getting is vinegarish water.
1,Very happy with my water kefir grains.  Soon as I made my first batch they started growing and multiplying.<br />Obviously healthy grains.
1,I was originally unhappy with my order as it appeared dead but after a complain they got back to me and sent a replacement. They gave me no trouble and the culture grew well since for several months and I am well pleased. And in there defense Pennsylvania had a earthquake and very strange weather the first go around.
1,"The first batch was a little disappointing, but as the batches progress, they keep getting better.  The grains are now large and healthy (4 batches) and the kefir water is greatly improved.<br /><br />I want to note that that while there are no guidelines on the box as to how much of this natural probiotic to drink, you are not limited to amount per day.  Also, note that the kefir water, if placed in the refrigerator, will keep for up to 2 weeks.  I use a small jar (about 1/2 gallon) at a time.  I use organic sugars--palm sugar, coconut sugar, etc.  Experiment, because all of the different sugars will give you different flavors.  One idea (that I haven't done yet, but will) is to add dried fruit for flavor.<br /><br />There are some sites online that will help you with the process.<br /><br />Handle the kefir grains with care.  They are living organisms, and will replicate and grow if you take good care of them.<br /><br />Keep the kefir water in a cool place while it ""grows"", preferably in the dark or under a towel.<br /><br />This is good for you--and the flavor grows on you :)"
0,"My grains came in a zip lock bag, a very small amount and is of very poor quality. I will have to start over, as the grains I received have not grown at all, despite careful care. Very Disappointed!"
1,"After the intial rehydration period is over. You can make a  tasty, healthy, probiotic rich drink for your family. It is really tasty with sliced fresh ginger and sliced organic lemon added to the finished product. You can flavor your drink with fresh fruit, dried fruit or even juice just to name a few Once you buy the grains as long as you keep them feed, they will live indefinately."
1,"I purchased my grains from Baine King of  Lifetime Kefir just about a month ago and they arrived in excellent condition. I have used the grains a few times now and they have grown enough for me to share them with my son, who wanted to try them too.<br /><br />I enjoy the water and am trying some fruit recipes to make summer drinks. Fun way to make a healthy drink!"
1,I've had these water kefir grains for several months now and they perform beautifully.  I've given up drinking conventional soda/pop because it's so horrible for my health.  It's cool to be able to come up with my own flavors ... and even better to know that it's so healthy for me.  These grains are great and the seller is always there if you have questions.  I'd order more kefir grains from him in a heartbeat!
0,"One star because you can not indicate no stars, which would be my rating.<br /><br />I ordered this product because I trust ""Cultures for Health"" products. When I received the package it was not in the Cultures for Health package but rather in a plain bubble envelop in zip lock bag. I contacted the vendor to ask what was going on. The vendor responds: ""You have ordered and received kefir grains from Fermentation Cultures, we have no association with Cultures for Health.""<br /><br />So I say, ""If you have no association why does the the product description say: Water Kefir Grains by Cultures for Health LLC.""<br /><br />He responds, ""That is how amazon works, if I have to sell things similar to those that are already on amazon, they will place it this way.""<br /><br />What? Fermentation Cultures???<br /><br />I wrote to Cultures for Health and they were aware of this fraudulent use of their name and had contacted Amazon with no results.<br /><br />I have ordered many products from Amazon and this has never been the case. This drastically reduces my trust in Amazon. I asked Amazon to please explain what the seller means by ""that is how Amazon works,"" wanting to know if what he stated is true in any way.<br /><br />Amazon wrote: ""I'm sorry this has been a disappointing order experience for you; this doesn't normally happen."" What is it that doesn't normally happen? I never received a satisfactory explanation regarding this false advertising.<br /><br />Amazon did provide a refund but that is not my concern. I ordered frequently from Amazon and until this occurrence I was under the impression that sellers were offering products as advertised. I wanted to know if this is a routine practice of Amazon. And if not, why wouldn't Amazon have the faulty association removed from the product description? No answers. The seller's page is still up and the product description still proclaims it's by ""Cultures for Heath.""<br /><br />I have not purchased anything from Amazon for six months. I have found other sources for many routine items; this equates to many hundreds of dollars. I may consider a purchase here and there but Amazon failed big here.<br /><br />You can find the authentic product by doing a simple search; they do not sell on Amazon."
1,"We've been pretty satisfied with these overall. They produce a nice stinky drink that does its job. My husband thinks the water should be more carbonated, but I'm not sure if that's us doing it incorrectly, the grains themselves, or him being too picky.<br /><br />Make sure you have lots of glass bottles. We look like crazy people now with all the bottles we have around the house."
1,"There was a problem with shipping and they sent me more kefir grains to avoid the delay that was caused by the shipper. They were more than helpful and responded promptly to my email. The grains are working great, as it says in the instructions they take about a week to start working but now they are multiplying and happy. Thanks so much for you help and great product!"
1,I am so happy with my kefir grains.  I received them quickly and they had instructions on rehydrating them.  They are very easy to work with.  Now we are having the fun of experimenting with different flavors to find out what our favorites are.  I definitely recommend them. :0)
1,"I have bought from Cultures for Healthy (directly from the site) several starter cultures; buttermilk, water Kefir, Filmj&ouml;lk, greek yoghurt, and kombucha. All the cultures came in sealed pouches in dry form. They need to be hydrated first before doing the first batch of the medium. I didn't activate as soon as I got them; got to do it last Friday. The kombucha ""mushroom"" is triving; I can see it getting thick and as they say in the enclosed instructions it make take up to 28 days for the culture start to create another ""mushroom"". The buttermilk starter took 48 hours to culture one cup of organic milk (it is delicious), the Filmj&ouml;lk also cultured in 48 hours (it lookd a little disgusting and I though that I had made a mistake, but I took a tablespoon of the stuff to culture a cup o milk and it did look a little like spoilled milk with a ""cheesy"" smell, but after mixing it and tasting it, it tasted fine, a little sour but not tangy new taste for me, but I ate it with some diced mango; delicious). The water kefir is still going, and I am waiting. The Greek yoghurt starter I didn't use it yet. Overall, the packaging is fine, the product is good, time is needed to let these starters come to live; now, I decided to warm the milk to ""lukewarm"" before adding the cultures because I though the milk from the fridge was too cold. Overall, I am satisfied with the products from  Cultures for Health."
1,This is WONDERFUL!!!!!  My kefir grains are thriving and my family has homegrown probiotics instead of having to rely on supermarkets products (Yogurt etc.) that have too much sugar.  I can feel the difference and know that they are working and our illnesses in our home have been reduced since adding these and mega vitamins to our regimen.  I would recommend everyone take these.  They have milk kefir grains and MANY others.  Cultures of Health has a wonderful product line to choose from as well.
1,"Fermented kefir beverage is good for my health maintenance. By following the instructions given by the Seller + with right  care,the water kefir grains will be reusable for an indefinite time. Hence, makes it an  affordable and cheap probiotic health beverage. I have been drinking daily since past three weeks after have received the grains that I bought from Cultures for Health via Amazon.com.  Services rendered by Amazon and Cultures for Health are fast and excellent."
0,What arrived is not a true cultures for health product. I would not feel safe using as I don't know the home where these are produced.
1,"I was hesitant to buy these grains after reading some of the reviews, but the lower price convinced me to give them a try.  They were great!  The water kefir had a great taste and multiplied like crazy.  The grains were in a tiny glass jar with a lid-- no baggies with my order-- and there was also an instruction sheet included with my shipment to get me started."
1,"I can't believe how great service I got, I just placed my order this morning and I have the product in my hands right now!!! My order was delivered personally by the seller(he left like 10 minutes ago), I am fortunate to live close to them.  The grains look great they were delivered in a glass container with some liquid, the guy said that they were not going to need any recovery time and that I was to start making kefir immediately, and he even showed me how to care for them! OMG I'm so happy!!!<br />I will for sure recommend this seller to my friends in church and school!!<br /><br />Thank you Dave from the Kefir Store!!"
1,"I have purchased many cultures from Cultures for Health over the years, and I have never been disappointed. They are always 100% healthy and pure when they arrive. I also love the clear instructions that come with each culture. I have purchased Sourdough Starter, Water Kefir Grains, Milk Kefir Grains, and a Viili Yogurt Culture just to name a few.<br /><br />Cultures for Health also has an extremely easy to use website full of tutorials and information that really walks you through step by step and helps troubleshoot any problems you may have.<br /><br />You honestly couldn't ask for a better company or product.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!"
1,"I was so lucky to find these on Amazon! I am on my second batch on kefir water, and my family is hooked!"
1,"I couldn't find whole wheat pastry flour in my local store. Bummer, because I had just gotten a new baking book where most of the recipes called for this kind of flour...!<br /><br />Love that this is organic and that it comes with the ""subscribe & save"" option!"
1,"I am very impressed with the way these taste!  They taste just like a sour (in a good way) fruit roll-up.  You don't taste the fruit that it's suppose to be, but they still taste wonderful!"
1,"Still trying to figure out if Chia seeks are really good for your joints - and supposedly they also have Omega 3.  All good.  Regardless, the blueberry fruit chia bar is a nice treat and makes the chia seeds go down very easily.  It's better than a candy bar."
1,"If you're hooked on illy, as my wife and I are, this appears to be the cheapest way to obtain it: ~$33.33/kg. The same coffee in 1/4kg tins can run almost twice that."
1,"Pre-measured individual foil packets of three choices of coffee; Columbian (my favorite), Irish Creme and Hazelnut. This is the first time I've ever taken a chance on ordering any kind of food product over the internet. I WILL order more of this coffee as soon as I get close to running out. Evidentually, this is a very old established company and I can certainly see why they're still in business. Their product is EXCELLENT!"
1,"If you like the taste of strawberry Pocky or strawberry Yan Yan, you will like these.  My fiance and I have an  American palette, but we were hooked on Hello Panda ever since he bought the ""Milk"" (Vanilla) flavor on a whim from the international aisle of a supermarket.<br /><br />They arrive in individual boxes packed in a display box (like at a store).  The individual packaging make them easy to throw in a bag or purse on the go (easy for pacifying fussy kids too!), and the individual outer cardboard package means these creme-filled cookies don't get crushed by your water bottle. :)"
1,These cookies are great. The biscuit part is not too sweet and the inside is a nice vanilla flavor. The designs are super cute as well~
1,These little chocolate cream filled cookies are pretty darn good.  I sent a few boxes with a friend of mine to take to work with her.  The people she works with devoured what she handed out and they were asking for more.  Looks like those folks will be placing orders with Amazon.com for more of these little chocolate cream filled devils.  Thanks Amazon.com.
1,"I bought these when I couldn't find the Choco-Koala cookies we usually buy. These are great little cookies and seem just like the Choco-Koala cookies. A light crunchy exterior with a wonderful chocolate center. They are small, so you can quickly chow down quite a few. Very, very yummy. Santa always remembers to bring some for the kids. Don't buy just a few boxes, get the whole case!"
1,"I bought these for a Halloween party with a lot of 2 & 3 year olds.  My kiddos treats were the hit, all the kids loved them and asked their parents for more.  Several parents said they snuck some of the cookies from their kids and loved them.  A fun snack for all!"
1,"these are by far the best cookies ive had in a long time, almost addicting for me xD"
1,Saw it at F.Y.E. At there unlike Amazon it was only $3.00. It was worth buying after I tryed it out. Taste like a fortune cookie with vanilla filling inside of it. Love it and yes would highly recommed.
0,These are made with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil; an adult can make the choice whether to eat them or not.  But why give them to kids with a perpetual sweet tooth who don't know any better?
1,"I like this dressing on any and all vegetable salads.  As a marinade for chicken, pork etc it is great.  Even stir fry vegetables taste better.<br /><br />My spinach salad with Mushrooms.<br /><br />Marinade mushrooms in the dressing for a few hours.<br />Add washed baby spinach<br />Add cranberries and pecans<br />Feta cheese can be added if desired.<br />a fresh, delicious and healthy meal"
0,These lupinis I got through Amazon were soaking in a cloudy white fluid.  I've gotten the identical brand locally and it has always been clear.  I didn't want to chance eating these since I know bad batches can contain botulism.
1,"I heard of ""barley water"" from a Brit friend and figured I'd have to try it. Quite tasty stuff, with a very nice ""mouth feel"" from, I assume, the barley flour. However, it's pricier than I'd prefer meaning I'm doubtful I'd order it again.<br />But I would absolutely recommend it to anyone wanting to try barley water."
1,"Everything is shrinking and Robinson's Barley Water is no exception. And the price has just jumped a couple of dollars as well!<br />Also, both bottles of our recent order arrived with strange dark brown stripes down the sides. Not very appealing."
1,The product was received as advertised----ahead of schedule.  It was just as advertised.  Excellent supplier and would recommend to others.
1,"My son in law is English and loves Robinson's Lemon Barley Water. So when they come to visit, I have some on hand."
1,Authentic ginger flavour & goodness.  Dissolves quickly in hot liquids.  Unusual application: Crush a packet and sprinkle 1/4 over strawberries or Grapefuit.  Delicious!
1,"Prince of Peace Ginger Honey Crystals<br /><br />Unfortunately I got these on the last day of a local tea shop -- and I say unfortunately because I became instantly enamored of the product.  A single packet produces a decidedly strong 10-12 oz cup, very nice and gingery, reminiscent of the hot ginger tea sometimes served on cold winter days at a Haitian restaurant I know.  The honey adds a nice complexity to the cup, but I'm also looking forward to adding a few cloves and cinnamon stick.  Many other uses for the crystals come to mind as well as simply dissolving in water -- I've been using it to sugar tea, both black and green, and I'll definitely try another reviewer's recommendation for strawberries or other fruit.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I wish the packet had somewhat less sugar (but with the same ginger and honey strength).  One packet, at 17 g, is getting a bit close to typical desert levels (I checked some sorbet in my frig, 23 g).<br /><br />That aside, I prefer this to the ginger tea I've been getting at a local Korean market, a kind of marmalade or jelly with ginger slices in a jar.  Not only does this product have a stronger, hotter ginger flavor, but it can be used in place of granulated sugar."
1,"I love this product and I share it with my family and co-workers.  JVS by way of Amazon is the best there is for online purchase and I will definitely continue to buy from them.  I am currently preparing for my third order in as many months.  Great for upset stomach, sore throats, stressful days and cool nights.Make it hot with water or milk to take the chill out!"
1,"I discovered this product years ago at a local asian market.  This is a miracle cure for an upset stomach, car sickness, seasickness, etc...My husband uses it when his IBS acts up.  When I go on a cruise, I bring one dose a day and I do not need to get the behind the ear tabs that I had used before.<br /><br />Before I found this, I would have to go get the ginger root, peel, slice, and steep to get a good tea for my stomachache, but this is tons more convenient.  Besides, who wants to do all that work when you are sick.<br /><br />The flavor is very strong so I found that I like it a little more watered down than it recommends but 1 or 2 ""doses"" when I am feeling queasy and it is gone."
1,"If you're into hot, spicy gingery tastes, you'll like this drink. It's intense, also because of the honey. I find it delicious, and I know some people who dilute it (using half a package per cup) to make it milder. Either way, it's yummy and satisfying. Very soothing on a winter day, and also if you have a cold or are suffering from nausea or stomach upset. It's also versatile. I dissolve a package into plain oatmeal--what an easy way to add unique flavor. I like that it's instant, and also that I can take along the sachets to work or on a trip. Highly recommend this!"
1,I've been ordering this product for about a year now and take it daily (has improved my ph balance!) and this vendor always has it in stock and ships it fast & free! Can't ask for better
1,"A coworker introduced me to these once when I had a terrible cough & cold.  At first I was hesitant to drink because of the strong aroma, but at FIRST SIP & INHALE, it immediately went to work!!  Instantly cleared my sinuses & soothed my throat so much, I knew I had to have stock at work & at home!  I also noticed I had improved enegy & just felt better all around!  I now drink these packets daily, if not twice a day, it was recommended that I drink one before bedtime & I did & woke up feeling FABULOUS!  It is hard to find these packets, I only found them at the mall's vitamin shop and I ""think"" at GNC, but Amazon has a great price & saves you the trip!!!!"
1,"I have been drinking this ginger tea for years, and can't live without it. I have IBS and digestive upset is a way of life unfortunately; however, this ginger tea is strong enough to provide a digestive tonic and it tastes good too. I wish it were a little less sweet, but I don't eat a lot of sugar normally. I am pregnant now, and have been drinking it throughout. It settles my belly and helps with the IBS symptoms as well. I have driven 2 hours before to get this from Chinatown, so I'm super happy that I can get it here when I need it as well!"
1,"I needed to find a coffee substitute for my husband.  Tried herbal teas, he said it tasted like he was licking a flower pot. I tried the Ginger Honey drink in his Thermos and he enjoyed it! The drink has enough ""punch"" in its flavor and the ginger is helping with inflammation and digestion. Good solution and it's easy to prepare-even he can boil water!"
1,"These are a staple in my pantry.  I make a two litter bottle of green tea with one or two packets of the ginger honey tea added.  I love the flavor and I don't get acid kick-back anymore.  I drink the honey ginger tea hot for a sore throat. It is wonderful in apple juice or other fruit juices as it give a punch to the drink.<br /><br />I also make a drink from green veggies and some fruit. This ginger honey really livens it up and makes it delicious. When I make shortbread cookies, I sprinkle this ginger on top before baking. I won an award for the cookies at a Scottish festival.  I buy 3-4 of the large bags at a time. It doesn't last long around here.<br /><br />It is great to sip on the front porch with neighbors and can be served hot in the winter and iced in the hot summers."
1,"I found lots of spicy ginger beers at Amazon, but the best price in the lot was <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SB04N8"">D & G, Soda Ginger Beer, 12-once (24 Pack)</a>; while $30 [$45 shipped] for 24 hard-to-find sodas isn't the worst pricing in the world,  it's still not going to be in my budget as an everyday beverage. This stuff is plenty affordable in the 30-count bag, and the flavor is exactly the spicy & sweet combination I remember from my youth in the South.<br /><br />It just arrived today, so I've not had the chance to try it with club soda in place of water, but I expect adding some fizziness will make this drink perfect! Look for an update to this review.<br />UPDATE: almost finished  with bag one, ordering more. Mixing the bag with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SBRS12"">Blue Sky Natural True Seltzer,  12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> does make a nice refreshing drink (I mix in a little <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004WX5J9I"">Tang Orange Powdered Drink Mix (Makes 22 Quarts), 72-Ounce Canister</a> for a citrus-ginger soda), but it's not as close to the Jamaican Ginger beer that I remember as I'd hoped.<br /><br />However, if I add it to store-brand ginger ale, it IS the flavor clone I'd been looking for! Five stars!<br /><br />Further update: There are many recipes foe home-made ginger ale on the web, and the process looks very simple...I'll keep a stock of these packets anyway, but I think I'll try fashioning my own brew this weekend!"
1,a very strong authentic ginger taste. much denser then ginger teas. only issue for me is that it contains too much sugar.
1,"Bought this for sea travel to relieve nausea, but found it works great for sore throat and cold symptoms.  Easy to use, tastes good, and I like the fact that you can drink it hot or cold."
1,"It doesn't have as much of a kick as the kind I bought in China but it does have a nice flavor, and soothing. I would prefer to use my own sweetener but this will do when I want something while traveling. I like it to keep my stomach settled and to ward off colds. If you like the taste of ginger, you will most likely like this. If you want unsweetened, try the Gold Kili."
1,"I am so addicted to the ginger crystals. The health foodr store in my neigborhood discontiued this product. I was so thrilled to find the exact item, and a better quality online. The ginger in the online version is alot stronger than the crystals that I purchased. I like to blend it with a nice berry tea or I will add lemon and a little tequila when I have a cold."
1,"I've been looking for a ginger tea that actually has the spicy taste of ginger, and I found it with this tea.  I don't have a ""sweet tooth"" per say, so I generally don't like a lot of sugar in things that I drink or eat.  Although this ginger tea is sweeten with honey and cane sugar, it's not too sweet for me to enjoy."
1,"A sure fire cure for when I have an upset stomach. And definitely helps with my GERD symptoms (acid reflux). It just always makes me feel better, that's the best I can say about it. Try it after a heavy meal."
0,"The ginger flavor is nice and strong.  The white sugar is excessive.  Nice convenient packages.  Similar to a strong, sweet lemonade."
0,"I love ginger and I eat it all the time, but this is far to strong.  I tried to use it in a large cup with tea and it burned my throat and my wifes throat.  I threw the bag away after that."
0,"I was drinking another brand of tea which is not sold in any of the stores where I live or on Amazon. I decided to give this brand a try after reading all of the positive reviews.<br /><br />I am very disappointed in this purchase. The tea tastes like sugar water. The ginger flavor is not strong at all. Even the crystals are lighter in comparison to the other product that I was drinking. Luckily, this product was very reasonably priced so I won't feel too bad about tossing the remaining bags if I can't find someone to give them to.<br /><br />I can't fault the seller here. The product was reasonably priced and arrived on time. I would purchase another item from them, but not this one.<br /><br />Just my two cents."
1,"It's great stuff. Really simple to use, and really good tasting -- I only sweeten it with a spoonful of honey or two as far as additives go. I used it all throughout my pregnancy as an all natural solution to my all day sickness. Sometimes it was all I could keep down.<br />I've recommend it to a LOT of my friends, pregnant and not, who are tea drinkers like myself, and I continue to thank the person who introduced it to me. It's good and soothing, not too harsh, like other ginger products I've tried, and it's good at any time; hot or cold. Hell, at the first sign of a cold, I start guzzling it down like nobody's business , an more often than not, it keeps my cold (especially sore throats) from getting any worse. It's something I'll swear by for life, I'm sure."
1,"This product was amazing during my pregnancy.  I packed it everywhere to aid in my nausea.  It worked beautifully. I haven't used it much since, unless I have an upset stomach, because I'm not a huge ginger fan.  But hey ... if you're suffering from morning sickness or suffer from nausea, this may work perfectly for you as well."
1,I was very happy with this product and this seller. I added the product to Hybiscus flower tea to replicate Jamaican Sorrel. It turned out great. The product was well packed and promptly shipped. The taste was what I wanted. I will buy from this seller again.
1,"My colleague had me try this ginger crystal a month ago when I had cramps. After drinking it hot, my cramps went away during the rest of my cycle and did not need medication. Recently my allergies flared up bad and again it relieved some of my symptoms."
0,"As Ginger is good to settle a stomach and, when I eat a Larabar Ginger Snap or a few Ginger cookies, it seems to satisfy my hunger, I had great expectations! I tried this cold and hot. I got a BLAST of Ginger heat in the back of my throat (expected) but no residual Ginger after taste,just an odd taste from the sugar (we use very little sugar so maybe just me). I had hoped to satisfy hunger but it doesnt seem to do that at all & seemed to MAYBE upset my stomach a little. Packaging quality & content uniformity is very good & dissolved quickly. I will be throwing the rest away partly because it is made in China and I am nervous about food items from there."
1,"I was introduced to this absolutely delicious drink by a colleague and was so impressed I went ahead and bought three packs right away.  My family and many friends totally LOVE it! It also a good drink for busy people: it's ready in no time...very healthy too, especially during the colder months to help build a healthy immune system..."
1,"A nice healthy cup a...ginger crystals?...Yep! This stuff is great! I found this when I came across it somewhere on clearance once and althoug it's very strong (I only use 1/2 packet per cup); depending on how strong you like ginger, you might use more :)  For winter or fall this is a wonderful thing to have around.  Remember how I said it's strong, well, I get 2 cups per packet (I like my tea very strong, but I like this the way I described). The value here-wow, you just can't go wrong.  And no, I am not getting any compensation here for saying all this, I just found a product I like and it's hard to find for such a great price. I can't do dairy either or much coffee, so haviing things like this just make life a little more fun.  Plus, it's so much better for you and chepaer than a drive-through drink :)"
1,The instant Ginger Honey Crystals are great. I love them. When I feel like a cold is coming on I have a hot cup and it works wonders and makes me feel better.
1,"excellent product, i love it. have to drink it every day! dissolve almost instantly. i recommended this product to everyone."
1,This one is excellent. The sachets are 18g and make a nice cup of tea especially as the colder season is approaching
1,"I had been brewing Ginger Tea from grated fresh ginger. Ginger Honey Crystals are easy and have a delicious flavor.  This is a strong tea and I enjoy it hot or cold.  I strongly recommend this product if you enjoy ginger tea.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SWB73C"">Instant Ginger Honey Crystals Pack of 30 Bags - 18 g Sachets</a>"
1,"I ordered this product after a friend of my mother's told her about it. My mother's friend uses it because she gets nauseous on a regular basis and ginger, which this product has in spades, helps a lot.<br /><br />I have a brain tumor which causes me to experience vertigo, dizziness, and nausea - all on a fairly regular basis. I have medication, ONDANSETRON HCL 8MB to be exact, which works, but gives me an incredible headache as a side effect of making my nausea go away. As a result, I need to take Aspirin at the very least, with the medication to offset the side effect. NOT a pleasant experience to say the least.<br /><br />I've had ginger before as part of juicing, which I do from time to time after watching the movie FAT, SICK, AND NEARLY DEAD (available via Amazon Prime streaming video and Hulu). However, I don't have the energy to make juice as often as I would like.<br /><br />This tea allows me to get some ginger into my system much easier. The ginger doesn't have the side effects that the aforementioned medication does, so it's my first choice. This tea is WAY too strong as is though. Instead of using a whole packet in a large cup of water, I use a teaspoon, and go from there if I need more ginger to relax my stomach. At least this means that the tea will last much longer.<br /><br />If you have chronic nausea for whatever reason, I'd give this stuff a try, just beware of the strength and be prepared to adjust the amount you use, unless you want your throat to burn from the high concentration of ginger."
1,"This tea is awesome! Authentic Ginger flavor. Certainly clears the sinuses.  If you like the stimulating, fresh flavor and aroma of Ginger, then this tea will please you.  Additionally, I don't have to add any sugar or other sweetener. Also, there are no tea bags to deal with as the crystals dissolve rapidly for the perfect cup.  I like it cold too.  I also add less water than recommended for an even more robust flavor.  I like it strong!"
1,This product is not only great tasting but very soothing effect on the stomach..Really love it hot or cold...Ireally like drinking this product hot after a long and tedious day.Tremendous and would order it again .
1,"This product is tasty and calming!  I really enjoyed it and would definatly buy more!  In fact, I think I'll go do that now.  It is VERY sweet, and instead of putting honey in, I put in lemon.  Tastes a treat!"
1,"I found this item by  accident.  I was looking for ginger elixer that I could put in my beer like at PF Changs.  It does the trick with my beer, but I do drink it hot every night before bed.  It settles the tummy and no caffeine effects."
1,"Makes a quick and tasty hot ginger tea.  I would enjoy it more with about half the sweetness, but that doesn't stop me from drinking it a couple times a day.  One packet could make 2 small cups.  If you don't like ginger, don't bother.  Will also dissolve in cold water, with a bit of shaking, if you prefer."
1,This is a delicious tea. my whole family is drinking it now and its all natural ingedients.<br />great for cold night as you sip this warm potent tea. You feel its killing all your throat bacteria!
1,I was introduced to this product by my neice at Christmas. It is so flavorful and refreshing. LOVE it especially during this flu and cold season.
1,"I bought this for the benefits of ginger and honey, and based on the high reviews. I enjoy hot teas and drinks in general. When I first tried this drink it was a little too spicey for me. I tried cutting it in half and that worked ok. The best solution for me is to add in a little cream or vanilla soy milk. It makes it creamy and just a little spicy like a chai tea. VERY enjoyable and soothing when not feeling well. It's also come in handy for morning sickness recently."
1,I love this spicy ginger drink & find it incredibly soothing when I'm sick so I keep it on hand for just such an occasion (and push it at others when they're not feeling well either!) I like to add a little lemon and honey. The ginger instantly numbs a painful throat and soothes the whole system giving you an immediate feeling a wellness. Love this stuff.
1,"Holy spicy ginger BatMan, this stuff has some serious ZING! I love ginger lemon tea and LOVE ginger chews (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKX4FW"">The Ginger People Original Ginger Chews, 12 - 2-Ounce Boxes, (Pack of 2)</a> so I thought I was well prepared, not so much! I dissolved 1 packet in 8 ounces of hot water and had to dilute it a bit. If you like spicy ginger zing, this is your product!"
1,"I love this product and the taste is amazing. I use it in recipes too that call for ginger instead of ginger powder. This is fast and convenient. I take it for travel and after a long scuba dive, super convenient and a great price. Love, love, love this..."
1,"This really tastes like ginger and honey!  Drink it hot or cold.  I like it as hot tea.  My son likes it both cold and hot.  It is inexpensive, too.  I will keep buying it as long as it is sold.  LOVE IT!!!"
1,I received a small box of these Ginger and Honey crystals and I fell in love with them! What a great way to bump up your cup of hot tea. They are strong and I would recommend starting with a small portion. I ordered two bags of thirty packs and now my Daughter in Law wants a 30 Pack. Love It!
1,"One day my mother in law sent me over some of these packets.  I was hooked with the first Packet.  I have a hard time with hot things.  The rest of my family could not tell the burn it gives.  They even like to just pour them into their mouths and let them dissolve.  The more of It I drank I finally got to where I can drink the whole packet now.  My doctor has taken me away from cream so my morning coffee was just horrible.  I now put one packet of this in my cup then put in a K-cup of my favorite coffee and wow what a wonderful spicy wake me up.<br /><br />I am a diabetic, and someone who does not like to eat.  So getting that little boost of sugar and honey first thing in the morning gives me time to get my breakfast ready.  I have low sugar and my doc is trying to get me to eat at least 1000 kilo/calories to 1400 kilo/calories.  Which is hard to do when you mainly eat raw vegetables and fruits. So for me.  This is a fast way to get my blood sugar up and stay up long enough for me to get some food in me.<br /><br />I know one person complained about the calories.  It does have 18 carbs per packet.  But the Ginger is good and very strong which works very well for settling my stomach. I used to have to take phenergan for nausea now a cup of this and I am good.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this as much as we do.<br />Atheena"
1,"It is a strong eye opener, the weak at heart should dillute it in a larger than 8oz cup/glass.  I enjoy it's strength and welcome all the ginger goodness.  I hope you'll try it and do the same."
1,A friend of mine told me about the ginger honey crystals. She gave me one to try and I was hooked. I use them when my stomach is upset. I have use them with cold and hot water. I prefer it in my hot green tea or just with hot water. It is very soothing. I have given a bag to my sister and she loves it.
1,I have bought this product twice and will continue to buy this product. They are fast and always keeps me informed via email. I have never had any problems and the product always arrives without any problems. I give this 5 stars.
1,"THERE SHOULD BE 10 STARS FOR THIS PRODUCT!  I love it and I drink it every day.  The price was also better on Amazon.com, so I always check here first when I see something that catches my eye.  Will reorder."
1,"Wow! Just open a packet and put it in cold or hot water. Tastes great, nice and honey sweet. But you've got to have a taste for ginger. Don't know any other product like it. Thanks Alex, for recommending!"
1,"this tea, is not just like any other tea, and its pretty hard to find too...<br />best ginger tea ever, is good for detox and stomachaches . got it pretty fast too, and was as described. thanks."
1,"My husband absolutely loves these and I was thrilled to find them on Amazon for such a great price. However, the product pictured is a bag, but mine arrived in 3 boxes of 10 packets each.  Not a bad thing, just different from what is pictured/described. I deducted one star though, because I'd prefer if one packet made more."
1,"Heck with mixing this stuff with hot or cold water! Eat it out of hand! It is an amazing head clearing delight! You're tummy gets all warm and fuzzy inside and the little honey colored beads are sweet and gingery-peppery-crunchy! Seriously folks, I take medication for some pretty nasty headaches and the medicine is probably worse than the headaches. Well, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SWB73C"">Instant Ginger Honey Crystals Pack of 30 Bags - 18 g Sachets</a> makes taking that medication tolerable. It's great stuff! I received the product faster than expected and at a fantastic price. Can't be beat. Excellent! Cheers!"
1,I continue 2 purchase the Ginger honey crystal tea. It's the best!!!! I luv it hot or cold.<br />It's very soothing and the price is EXCELLENT!
1,I love this stuff. I find it acts as a cleanser for your system. I did have to travel to China-town to buy but Amazon is much more convenient and runs about the same price.
1,My husband gave up coffee and drinks this daily.  It's 3 times the price at the local healthfood store.  Wish it was subscribe and save.  My husband doesn't tell my he is out until he is totally out.  Luckily it arrives 2 days after ordered.
1,"The Prince of Peace Instant Ginger Honey Crystals originally didn't impress me because the first ingredient was cane sugar, followed by honey and then ginger.  Because we don't drink many sweet beverages, the 70 calories and 17 sugar grams seemed outrageous.  We also were not thrilled with the biblical proverbs imprinted on the packaging.  After opening the first pouch, however, our family was hooked on the spicy sweet crystals.  Each pouch contains 12 grams of ginger and it is very, very spicy, just what we like around here.  We empty a packet into a little jar and always have some accessible in the kitchen.  I use a little binder clip on a packet in my bag when traveling, so I can slip a few crystals on my tongue even when there's no water available.  I add this to white or green tea, mix it in my chai and add no other sweetener, sprinkle it on yogurt, fruit and fiber cereal in the morning, and even have used it to tone down an overly spicy seafood stew I made last week.  I don't know how, but throwing in about a half teaspoon worked a miracle.  The hot beverage is great when we're nauseous or just feeling less than perfect, and when chilled, is a perfect complement to one of those clear beverages we may drink for relaxation.  If you like ginger, think about taking a break from the ginger chews/candy and try these little delectable crystals instead."
1,"Awesome! I had this tea years ago and was thrilled to find it! I share it with everyone! It's good for you, too!"
0,"I got this because I am pregnant and experiencing nausea.  I had never had anything like this, so I was not aware of what it would be like.  I did read the reviews and most people seemed to really like this product, so I gave it a try.  I did not like it!  It is very spicy, which to me did not seem fitting for a drink.  I was only able to get down half a glass of this.  If you are pregnant and looking for something to ease your morning sickness, try ginger tea instead.  I got some lemon ginger tea... it is very good!  Also try ginger hard candies.  I got some of those as well.  If you are just a lover of all things ginger, go ahead and try it!"
1,"One of my most frequent purchases from Amazon is this delectable sausage. It's made with lamb and Moroccan spices.  It has some heat in it.  We use it when we make spinach pizza, but there are other recipes in which it can be used, particularly in a Julia Child recipe for braised lamb shank, found in Mastering the Art of French Cooking.  It lends a delicious flavor of North Africa to whatever recipe you use Merguez in.  This is the only brand I've ever found for merguez, and I recommend it highly."
1,"After looking locally for a jungle animal themed cake topper for a baby shower, I saw this edible one on Amazon. It was inexpensive, shipped quickly, and lasted for weeks in the package before being used. Everyone commented on how adorable it looked on the cake. I would highly recommend it for anyone seeking a jungle animal theme."
1,"This product ended up looking exactly as it did in the picture.  It was incredibly easy to put on the cake, and made for a beautiful display.  I paid an extra $15 at a bakery for something like this once, and I'm so glad that I found this online.  It turned out better than the one I had gotten at a bakery and my kids loved it."
0,I thought the topper was a bunch of little pieces that were puffed up.  Then I thought I could take the pieces and make the design like the example.  Unfortunately all it looked like was an iron on for a cake.  I should have spent the money and bought a sheet cake from the local grocery.
1,This cake topper is gorgeous. It's really easy to put on.I highly recommend this topper for everyone who is  looking for Jungle Animals decoration. Shipping was fast.. Over all I had a great experience.  This seller did a great job.
1,"I ordered this for my son's birthday cake. It was adorable, and I got lots of compliments... I put it on a plain white 8"" round cake I ordered and it was easy to put on, though not as flat as I would have liked. Be careful that your cake is very flat. I will say, though, that well into the ""expected delivery"" window the product hadn't shipped, and I emailed the seller to cancel the order. Miraculously, I was informed by the seller (but not by Amazon) that it had already shipped and was too late to cancel. It did end up arriving a couple days later, but it took over a week from the time I ordered it until it actually shipped. I was frustrated with the experience."
1,"We bought this with a coupon at our warehouse grocery store wondering if we'd ever use it all, but here we are on our second canister now! Let me tell you, this stuff is very versatile! I know Nestle just advertises it as a chocolate milk drink mix, but we've found many uses for it.<br /><br />I use it with milk to make hot cocoas (and it's become my preference over Swiss Miss packets and the like), we've used it to add chocolaty flavors to baking projects, we obviously make our toddler the occasional chocolate milk for a treat, but my favorite thing to do with Nesquik powder is to make myself an iced mocha! (Although you could certainly make hot mochas as well). My husband has recently been on my case for spending almost $5 every day (sometimes twice) on Starbuck's iced mochas. I have a newborn, you see, so I'm sleep deprived and my coffee consumption has gone up. I'm addicted! But we realized the Starbuck's charges were adding up quite a bit, so as an alternative, most days I turn to Nesquik instead. It doesn't taste like Starbuck's mochas, but it does make for a tasty coffee drink if you like them chocolaty. I use one shot of espresso (or strong coffee if I'm away from our espresso machine), two spoonfuls of Nesquik, and fill the glass up the rest of the way with about 1 cup of milk. It's yummy! You can add ice, or keep it hot if you like. In the long run, we've saved money for sure by using the Nesquik.<br /><br />Finally, I have to say that as a mom, the ingredient list is satisfactory. This obviously isn't what you'd call health food, and certainly not advertised as organic or anything - but as far as the ingredient list goes it's pretty mild. No scary sounding ingredients I can't pronounce on the label - mostly minerals, vitamins, and sugar. There are no artificial sweeteners, as advertised. I absolutely expect us to remain regular buyers of Nesquik, it fits in nicely with my family!"
1,I have ordered these Honey Lemon Hard Candy from Amazon for a few years.  They have a great taste and are good for you and soothe a sore throat.  Our grandchildren are crazy about them.  I recommend these candy to anyone who loves honey.
1,"I discovered the Cadbury ""Time Out"" candy bar during a trip to Ireland. It is SO good... especially with a cup of coffee or black tea. I've special-ordered it since then. Wish it was easier to find, but  it's worth it!"
1,"This coffee is great and wonderful for  single people who like only one cup of coffee in the morning.  Easy, just add hot water, creme, sugar, etc.  Here is the problem.....we used to buy it at Walmart($3.48)...they still have the regular coffee with Caffine but where is the Decaf???  Many people have to have decaf....why is decaf  not showing up in the stores?"
1,This is the absolute best decafe on the market.  It even beats ground.  The only problem is finding it in the stores.
0,I was really disappointed in this product. Tastes like any cheap instant coffee. My favorite is Starbucks Via but was looking for a product where I was able to choose how much to use ie. if I only had time for a small cup vs. time to relax & enjoy a large cup. 8-(
1,"This is GOOD instant decaf coffee!!!  It smells good, it looks good, and the flavor is better than most cups of regular coffee served in restaurants.  That's my opinion and I'm stickin' to it."
1,I personally do not drink Coffee but my wife is an avid coffee drinker and she loved the product ! ! !
1,I love this coffee better than all others. It's pricy but you can't find it anywhere else so for me it's worth the price.
1,"I discovered this coffee when I was in El Salvador, I am so picky when it comes to coffee, I didn't have a coffee maker so I went to the grocery store and bought Buen Dia and loved it, I live in Canada and haven't been able to find it here and I just found it on Amazon! since I'm reviewing the coffee (not the store who ships it) I highly recommend it, nearly tops brewed coffee and it's perfect for work if you don't have a secretary who makes you coffee."
1,"This is the best freeze dried coffee I have ever tasted. It is a full bodied coffee, like freshly brewed coffee. The service that I recieved at Amazon was excellent."
1,"Similac travel bottles are an excellent, convenient way to travel with your child without the worry of keeping your formula fresh and ready for use. Just undo screw on top, replace with a nipple and ready, at room temperature, to use."
1,So very convenient and easy. I take these where ever I go with my baby. And I also use them when he wakes up in the middle of the night. They are quite wonderful. Only thing I don't like is the price. But you pay for convenience. Definitely recommend. My son has acid reflux and the powdered formula doesn't help that at all and the others you have to warm up after first use. These you just shake up poor and give to your baby. love them!
1,"I just love how convenient these bottles are! I keep one in the diaper bag in case the baby wants to eat when we're gone, and we're planning a trip out of state soon and I will be taking these with us.  So easy!  You only need a nipple and collar."
1,This is a great product. We switched from enfimil and our daughter throws up a lot less.  I recommend at least trying these!
1,"Love the bottles just twist and put on nipple cap=love it order it for the ease to just take with you anywhere,no mess or fuss!"
1,"Exactly what it's made for, on the go.  We always throw one in the diaper bag.  When we've taken long weekend trips, we just bought a pack of 24 and took the whole thing with us instead of taking a tub of formula and mixer."
1,"These bottles are perfect for long trips.  For traveling, they are definitely worth the extra cost over powder because of the added convenience.  We used these on a recent vacation to Hawaii and they were perfect.  We didn't have to mix powdered formula or clean bottles while we were on the plane.  Also, we didn't waste any formula since the bottles are single serving.  Make sure you get several of the nipples that attach directly to the bottle if you are going to be somewhere that you can't wash and reuse them."
1,"This is a great all around product. It's great to have the travel bottles handy. They soy formula was also great for my little one at first. It relieved all the discomfort he was having with milk-based formulas. However, after a few days I noticed that he was developing a rash on his body and face which seemed like eczema. I continued to use the product for 2 months since he seemed to really enjoy it and I attributed the rash to excessive heat and/or the detergent we were using. After changing all these variables I switched the formula again and low and behold his rash pretty much completely disappeared in less than 24 hours. So, great product, but just be careful with soy allergies as it may not be obvious right away."
1,"Panettone is a delightful fruity Bread. The dough is very smooth and chewy, sweet and confort. Ideal for tee, coffee and fruity wine (not sour). In some countries like Italy and Brazil they are very traditional specially around the holidays. In Brazil they are traditional as eggnog for us at Christmas. With that said. Bauducco is one of the best in the world, the consistency and texture is just right on this one, (and thats a big deal) hard to find, so if you know how a panettone should taste like, this is the best one for you. We love it. We normally go through 20 from November to New Years eve. I recommend, totally.  : )"
1,"This is just the best thing ever!  I've been able to buy it around the Holidays at Walgrens here in Florida.  I buy several at a time and sometimes have 3 or 4 sitting around the house especially as the season nears its end. We've tried three different kinds, chocolate, one other that we didn't like, and the classic ""Panettone Specialty Cake"" (26.2 oz) which is our favorite.<br /><br />This product will never end up as French Toast of Bread Pudding in this house - it's just so delicious on its own."
1,"I tried several different kinds and this one is the absolute best. It is so moist and chewy, with an amazing smell when you open the box. Highly recommend!!!"
1,"I love when this stuff comes out in stores every year, because that means I get to make bread pudding!  This bread is incredible for bread pudding, as it has spices and dried fruits already built in.  Just cube up, let sit overnight (or if in a hurry, just use it as-is), and use it as the bread component in a good bread pudding recipe (I recommend one from the Food Network).  This stuff is incredible!  It also makes fantastic stuffing!"
0,"Please don't be fooled. I thought I was purchasing a brand that was international, but it is made right here in the good ole USA.I have had a lot better! The taste is like a raisen bread."
1,"Happened upon this at Vitamin Shoppe the other day and was intrigued by the no sugar / all natural claims on the can. Ever since I started eating organics and staying away from highly processed food items, I've never felt better. So anyway, I had a can of this and felt amazing. I didn't realize it was the Solixir until later in the day, when I realized I had more energy and acuity than usual, which I attributed to the good stuff in the green can. I maintain a pretty routine diet, and am aware of what I eat/how it makes me feel. I could definitely see having a can of this on a saturday morning after a late evening, or after an intense workout, or even before it. I wrote this review because I tracked it down on the internet and found I could purchase it on Amazon. I'm ordering a case right now...!"
1,Great product and I noticed an immediate benefit from drinking Solixir.  Highly recommend to anyone looking for all-natural foods and beverages for their diets.
1,Recommend this product very highly - tastes great and is SO much healthier than most other drinks.  I love this stuff!
1,Love these drinks! All natural and very refreshing with a very pleasurable taste. This one is probably my favorite of the three.
1,"Pomegranate ginger Solixir is the BEST!  When I'm thirsty, I reach for a can of Restore.  I feel my body begin to hydrate as soon as I swallow my first few sips.  My taste buds jump with joy as the tingle of bubbles mix with the sparkle of ginger and the tang of pomegranate.  My mouth feels refreshed and clean when I'm done.  What a relief not feeling sugar coating my tongue and teeth.  No sugars or sweeteners (natural or artificial) other than the 30% juice. This has been on my Subscribe and Save list for over a year.  I've had to double my order as friends and family keep grabbing them out of the fridge."
1,I found this product in an ad in my yoga magazine- becauase I live in a rural area- I couldn't sample one locally... so I searched Amazon- and found them. I bought a case of the orange and one of the green- they are good. Unique fizzy taste- it's like a flavored water.. but with fizz and it's all natural botanicals!
1,"Solixir is my new favorite beverage!  Each can of solixir is packed with >1,400mg of botanical extracts designed to serve a functional purpose.  The light botanical blend is the perfect balance between juice and sparkling water.  There is no added sugar.  It's all natural.  The Pomegranate Ginger, also called ""Restore"", is the ultimate beverage for maintaining good hydration and a healthy balance without consuming lots of added sugar and artificial ingredients.  Also check out the Blackberry Chamomile ""Relax"" and the Orange Mate ""Awaken"" for a well-rounded selection of functional, healthy beverages."
1,"Great new product; low sugar, low calories. It's delicious and healthy after a hard workout or long day."
1,"I had heard about this new drink, but a Whole Foods is not near me. I drank the Restore after a workout and it helped refresh my body. The taste is amazing."
1,"I bought it when it was 27 bucks, and it went down to 19.11 with subscribe and save 2 days later. Kind of disappointing, but it was so good I had to buy another case.<br /><br />It really does taste good and it's filling, would probably substitute a meal if you wanted it to."
1,"I can only say that this V8 is the most addicting I've ever had.<br /><br />I've had V8 Tropical before, but this is one of the best I've ever had.<br /><br />It's hard to really review this item as taste is subjective, but for those of you who enjoy berry flavored beverages, this is one to try.<br /><br />The bottle is a moderate size, a lot smaller than a two liter bottle of soda, so expect to finish it very quickly.<br /><br />There is a lot of nutrition in this bottle, but you should be careful as there is a lot of sugar as well.<br /><br />I got this, and finished all 8 bottles within 10 days. Seriously, this was an awesome drink.<br /><br />For those of you who don't enjoy sweets as much, I would recommend putting half and half. Water helps lower the sugar concentration, and the sweetness, but it doesn't take away the taste, it still taste really good."
1,"Was a heavy soda drinker and decided to quit cold turkey. It was a struggle and constantly on my mind while at work until I picked up a case of this. This, with a reusable tumbler, make for the perfect healthy substitute. I still can't believe it has a full serving of fruits AND vegetables."
1,"Arrived really quick! was great and will for sure order agian from this person, came as expected and could not be more satified with the purchase i made"
1,"Below is a link that I made about this juice and other awesome products I've purchased on Amazon. This particular V8 Fusion Juice truly makes me feel better.  I order it here by the case with a subscription.  It tastes great, but I really have to water it down because it has such a concentrated flavor.<br /><br />[...]"
1,"Gambled and bought a case of this juice @ $2/bottle, (had never tried it before). It was very tasty! Yesterday, I saw the regular price at grocery store is $4.39."
1,taste is good<br />and only reason i bought is because of the ACAI berry which is a super fruit but sadly they dont display in any way or format how much ACAI berry are in each glass.<br />SO I WOULD LIKE MORE ACAI IN SIDE AND A LISTING OF HOW MUCH PER GLASS<br /><br />until then this drink can never ever be 5 stars
0,"My very first impression of this was that it tasted fine, but if that were true, I wouldn't have so many bottles of it left still, and it wouldn't be so hard to finish an open bottle of it. In the meantime I've zipped through a couple cases of V8 Splash (which doesn't have veggies in it though), and used a couple cases of regular V8 juice as pasta sauce (cooking pasta in V8 instead of water in the microwave - V8 turns to sauce while pasta cooks - one step)."
1,ACAI IS ONE OF THE HOT NEW FLAVORS. I SAW IT ON OPRAH THAT ACAI HELPS WITH WEIGHT LOSS BUT DIDN'T WANT TO BY THOSE EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS. I WAS GLAD TO SEE IT HERE.
1,"As an ex-pat, I'm sorry to say that when it comes to scones, I can't bake them to save my life.  Enter Green's scone mix.  Easy to prepare, easy to bake, and they produced wonderful little scones that even my gran would have enjoyed!"
1,"I had these scones at a tea house on the Central Coast of California and had to buy the mix.  Ate the mix we bought there, so we were so glad to find them available on line.  They are more traditional ""bisquit"" type scones (not the sweetened pastry type we Americans are getting used to seeing at places like Starbucks).  They are yummy with Devon Cream and a dollop of jam or lemon curd."
1,I wanted to watch the royal wedding with tea and scones.  The package arrived on time and in great shape.  The scones were easy to make and delicious.
1,"I am not a bona fide cook, nor am I a barbecue expert.  Most of my sampling of authentic down-south barbecues has happened on business trips, and I've sampled most of the types of barbecue sauces available at the local grocery stores.  I happened to luck on this one at the grocery store the other day when shopping for something that wouldn't be too spicy for the chillun.  We brought it home that night and used it to dunk pieces of chicken, and I was blown away.<br /><br />I am at a bit of a loss as to how to describe the flavor.  It is sweet and tangy, and slightly spicy but just enough to be pleasant-- I don't think people with even sensitive palates would dislike this sauce.  In a way, though of course they have some different ingredients, this is like a much more refined, more delicious version of the Sweet Chili chicken nugget sauce from McDonald's, which we also like.  (No, this is not the creme de la creme of food connoisseur reviews, but you knew that going in.)<br /><br />The ingredient list on my bottle includes these items in order: water, vinegar, sugar, tomato paste, molasses, and honey, with less than 2% of salt, aged cayenne pepper, natural smoke flavor, modified food starch, dextrose, spice, corn syrup, caramel color, garlic, xanthan gum, onion, sodium benzoate as a preservative, maltodextrin, tamarind, autolyzed yeast extract, and natural flavor.  Ingredients may of course change over time, so make sure to read the ingredients on whatever you buy.<br /><br />I've only used it for dipping, not actual barbecue.  As a grilling sauce I'd say it's ever so slightly on the thinner side of normal, possibly due to vinegar content, but would still work for grilling, especially with extra basting.<br /><br />ETA: During the writing of this review, I had to go heat up some chicken so I could have some of this sauce."
1,"These gummis are absolutely delish! They are not has hard as the gelatinous gummis but every bit as delicious. They are gelatin-free, made from a sea lettuce which I guess they call ""gellan"" in the ingredients.<br /><br />My only peeve has to do with the little write-up on the back of the bag, in which they state: they wanted to get rid of the meat gelatin in their sweets and ""get rid of all the other stuff that wasn't good"".<br /><br />Well, a quick look at the ingredients reveals that the gummis are still made with corn syrup, sugar and modified corn starch as the top three ingredients, lol! so gelatinous meat is not good but sugar is... whatever!<br /><br />the other ingredients are: acidulant, citric acid, gelling agent, gellan, flavors, acidity regulator, trisodium citrate, fruit concentrates, elderberry extract, fructose, invert sugar syrup.<br /><br />These gummis are gelatin free, fat free, dairy free, gluten free, all natural colors and flavors.<br /><br />Since it's mostly sugar, 7 pieces of these peach dreams pack about 121 calories!<br /><br />Anyway, for a nice splurge now and then, I'd take these gummis over the traditional ones any day. My favorite flavor is strawberries and cream--two different flavors in one bag. Yum!"
1,"These peach gummis are flavorful and delicious.  The peach flavor is fragrant and delightful, and the dusting of sugar on the outside gives it nice contrasting textures. I feel good eating them knowing that they don't contain mystery animal parts like most gummis that contain gelatin products.  I highly recommend them!"
1,"This product was so great to have on hand when my husband and I are having something my toddler cant eat, such as a spicy pasta dish, etc.  Because it has veggies, it makes it a pretty nutricious meal."
1,"I'm a big gum chewer but I don't really like the taste of mint, so that limits about 75% of the options out there for me.  I mostly chew fruit flavored gum and have recently enjoyed the other gums in the ""Dessert Delights"" series, with Orange Cream Pop becoming my go-to choice lately.  I was excited to see this new flavor introduced since I love the taste of actual root beer floats.  I bought a single pack to try it out, and was really impressed!  In my opinion it tastes just like a root beer float (or as much as a stick of gum could) and now I chew it exclusively.  I'm on Amazon today to buy a 10-pack pack, if that says anything about my satisfaction.  I will admit that it doesn't last too long, maybe 5 minutes or so before the flavor starts waning and in 20 minutes you're chewing on flavorless rubber.  However, in my experience most non-mint flavored gums don't last much longer than that anyway."
1,"I love this gum, but I'm a root beer fan, so this taste just like a root beer float to me. BUT, I have had my Mom and son try it, and they did not cared much for it, but neither are root beer fans. It's sweet enough for me, but they both said the flavor was not strong enough for them. (Keep in mind they both love peppermint gum - a very strong flavor.)"
1,"Sometimes I get tired of eating the plain ones.  The chocolate ones seem to make me more hungry, or make me just want more for no reason.  The cinnamon ones are just right for me."
1,"the product is moist,tasty and high quality, however it is packed in sunflower not olive oil, I would recommend it the lemon nicely balances the sardines and is actually lemon not citric acid."
1,"Everyone knows that Portuguese sardines are the best.<br /><br />Everyone, that is, except the sardines themselves, when they stray into Spanish territorial waters off the coast of Galacia, just north of Portugal.<br /><br />That's where these were nabbed. So while technically our conquistadores are Spanish, for all practical intents and purposes you can consider them Portuguese.<br /><br />Certainly, that's how they taste, and at a price that's lower than you would pay for their cousins just across the border.<br /><br />Furthermore, these fish are presented in a decidedly upscale fashion. As we learn from the back of the carton, ""Artisan fishing methods, old master cannery know-how and the highest quality ingredients produce a sardine that is moist, tender, and uncommonly flavorful"".<br /><br />In addition, they are ""hand packed"" and ""100 % natural"". Lemon in the olive oil adds some welcome zip.<br /><br />After all this my stomach's rumbling. Bring `em on!"
1,"Both my husband and I like Sardines, but not just any Sardines will do.  These sardines met most of our ""must haves"" expectations. They are high quality, well cleaned and prepared, and flavorful.  However, the fish are fairly large for Sardines so there are only 4 fish or so in a can."
1,I am a lover of halvah and could exist on it if it wasn't for the calories. This sugar free halvah is almost like the real thing. Will purchase again.
1,"I originally started my dog with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004WBZ47C"">Paragon Hedgehogs</a> - made of the same substance at the toothbrushes, but in a larger form factor - when he was a teething puppy about a year ago.  At that time, he was really slow to finish an entire Hedgehog, but once his adult teeth came in, the thing would be gone in a day and that was way too much dental chew to be ingesting at a time.  Now we give him one toothbrush a day after dinner.  He'll spend half an hour looking for the perfect hiding spot for it and then give in and eat it.  He loves these ""toothbrushes"" and gets so excited when we give one to him.<br /><br />These treats are made from vegetable starch and have a mild smell like potatoes.  They are currently made in Holland.<br /><br />The ""toothbrushes"" come in a few sizes. Our pup is 15lbs and we give him the ""toothbrushes"" from the ""small 28ct"" bag.<br /><br />The one issue I have with these chews is that they contain titanium dioxide (for coloring) which some studies show is toxic in large quantities.  I'd prefer if they left this ingredient out but unfortunately I've found that nearly every dog chew has something questionable in it."
1,"My dog refuses to let me brush her teeth, even though I bought the peanut butter flavored toothpaste.  I won't give her Greenies because they are hard for dogs to digest.  The Paragon chews keep her teeth very clean and are easily digestible."
1,"These are the longest-lasting chews we've tried, and we've tried them all!  Much harder than greenies to eat up, and they don't leave stains on the carpet (even the green ones!)."
0,"This is NO innocent product - my dog got one of those stuck on his throat and is now almost dying - esophageal surgery, aspiration pneumonia and other complications - and now I just hope he makes it and I can afford it - I already spent over $3,000 - and all because of a treat that claims to be highly digestible and natural."
1,"Our three dogs love these chews, which we alternate with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CE9I9S"">Sam's Yams Big Boyz Sweet Potato Dog Treats, 1-Pound Bag</a>. A daily dose of these chew treats seems to minimize the tartar buildup. We usually feed this medium size to our two 50 pound-ish dogs and the large size to our 65-lb Aussie/Chow mix. We appreciate the all veg, highly digestible ingredients and great chewing action (they're good and chewy, but not hard enough a dog might break a tooth on them), and the fact they're made in Holland, while our dogs seem to appreciate the flavor and gum-massaging action. Be sure to have plenty of fresh water available for your dog, as ours always enjoy a good long drink after finishing their chew treats.<br /><br />This product comes in a variety of sizes, and the sizing information isn't always clear. The ""product dimensions"" given here describe the size of the PACKAGING, not the product. For clarification, these Paragon medium-sized Star Toothbrushes measure 4"" long and 1 1/8th"" wide at their widest point (the base of the ""handle,"") while the large size are 5 1/2"" long and 1 1/2"" wide at their widest point. I hope that's helpful."
1,"This product is of high quality and consistency, and my dog loves them.  This is a cheaper way to purchase them than individually from my local pet store."
1,"When I ordered this product, I was too lazy to convert ""3-4 mm"" to inches and consequently discovered the ""Coarse Grinder Salt"" was almost 1/4"" (1/6"" to be exact), way too coarse for my salt grinder.  Shortly after receiving my order from Amazon, I received a courtesy email from the Spice Lab to make sure I was happy with my order.  I replied that actually I was not happy, but the fault was mine because I didn't convert the metric dimensions to English units and consequently didn't realize how coarse the salt would be, which was too coarse for my salt mill.  Two days later I received a package of smaller crystals, no charge.  That's amazing customer service!"
1,"This pink salt has a very nice subtle flavor. I didn't know salt could vary in flavor until I tried this one. We bought the salt initially because (a) it's organic and (b) my daughter wanted pink salt! But the flavor is what really made the difference. I don't know much about salt, but I want to say that this has a ""rounded"" flavor meaning it isn't harsh or distinctive on food, rather it seems to become part of the food, going in and bringing back the flavor of the food in an enhanced way. Sounds silly, but I am learning good quality ingredients really make a difference."
1,"Yes, I do use this product for salting some of my foods, but it also has another handy use. Because the grains of salt are much larger than normal, I use this salt to clean my cast iron grill and skillet. I pour one or two tablespoons of salt on the slightly warm grill or skillet, and rub the salt into the bottom and sides of the pans with a wadded up paper towel. The salt even quickly makes short work of cleaning the RIDGED bottom of my cast iron grill pan. Works perfectly. I usually keep two or three packages of this product on my spices shelf because I use it frequently both for salting food and cleaning the cast iron."
1,"We were pleased with this salt. It's actually more salty than regular salt, even kosher salt or sea salt.  A little bit goes a long way!  I don't usually cook with it, but add it to things afterwards. I've been hand grinding it."
1,"Not sure, but have been reading about Himalayan salt and apparently there is a high fluoride in this salt according to several reviews I've read, and that's not so good.  However, it looks very nice in my salt mill and tastes much better than Morton salt and I don't use it everyday.  Also, it's mined in Pakistan if that really matters."
1,"placed the order on tuesday, received it on saturday with the cheapest shipping; super faster. the himalayan salt comes in a sealed ziploc bag that has a bottom that allows it to sit up vertically which is convenient for storage especially if you have way too many spices and sacks of beans and sugars and what not like me. in addition, it came with 3 samples (himalayan salt, lemon citron flake salt, and cyprus white flake salt) weighing quite a few grams each (sorry, doesn't say the weight and i don't have a scale with me at the moment).<br /><br />as far as product quality goes, i typically buy my himalayan salt from whole foods and aesthetically this salt look exactly like the salt i get from whole foods. i haven't tasted it yet, but i bet it tastes like salt. of course price wise this salt (the spice lab) is WAY cheaper than buying himalayan salt at whole foods (even including shipping)."
1,"This is a great salt; it has a wholesome flavor and, I noticed it doesn't make you thirsty or rise the blood pressure as regular salt does. That's the benefit of the natural balance of minerals in it. I would recommend this to friends and health conscious people."
1,"This salt is so pink and taste like the ocean, I love it. Make sure to buy a grinder of some sort if you plan to use it on salads or sprinkle on cold dishes."
1,This is the first time I have used land mined salt.  I usually use salt from various sea sources.  After reading several reviews here on Amazon I decided to try this salt.  I was very pleasantly surprised the first time I tasted the salt. The flavor was fresh and subtle.  Not like the salt you usually buy in the grocery stores. Plus it has a lot of trace minerals your body needs.  I highly recommend this salt.
1,I love pink himalayan salt! It is loaded with minerals and taste great.  I don't have to use as much as the conventional table salt and I don't feel bad about using it because I know that it's also really good for my body.
1,"The product has far fewer pink crystals than shown in the picture, which is perfectly fine with me.  The salt is coarse, excellent for salt mills.  It tastes great and the size is what I wanted and haven't been able to find elsewhere.  The price and service is excellent, as well."
1,"I have not purchased this from Amazon yet as still on what I purchased elsewhere BUT I noticed many people buying the one pound bag. Just to let you know: one kilo equals 2.2 lbs. Why would you buy the one pound bag on something that never goes bad when you can get more than double for just a few dollars more.<br /><br />Dr. Mercola's comments regarding Himalaya salt benefits are what started me using this initially a few years ago. Many micronutrients, great purity. One person questioned the iodine: no salt naturally contains iodine unless it is iodized or contains some sort of seaweed. You can easily see his comments at mercola.com.<br /><br />Himalaya salt has a very 'clean' taste--add at the end of cooking."
1,"I bought Himalayan Organic Salt twice. Each time, quality was really good and service was fast and courteous (The Spice Lab's). I will buy it again."
1,"I was very pleased with the Himalayan salt. It really does taste much better than ordinary salt and you can actually taste some of the other minerals in it. I would describe it like licking a salty rock, but in a good way. Very pleased and will be buying more."
1,"I have never ordered sea salt before. i thought this was great. I was afraid it would have some additional flavor that I wouldnt like. Instead it was fresh tasting & natural. I like the pink color, but glad it doesnt come out pink."
1,"I'll certainly be a repeat customer. I had a tough time finding large salt crystals to refill a grinder, but this fit the bill nicely.<br /><br />Flavor is clean with slight minerality. The color is not a deep as some other himalayan pink I've seen, but it's a very good finishing salt, and a good conversation piece when put on the table in a clear grinder.<br /><br />Also, the seller included a coupon for a future purchase in the package, which was a nice bonus."
1,This salt has a slightly earthy taste. It is moderately coarse. I bought a ceramic grinder for when I would like to have it a little finer. I love this salt!
1,Great salt! Though now that I know how great it is I will have to buy a bigger bag next time. Mixed with some epsom salt and essential oils this makes a great bath salt. Ground up a bit finer it is wonderful for cooking. Will certainly buy again.
1,"I had been told that Himalayan salt was much better for you.  After shopping around, I found the best deal was through Amazon.  It came in a heavy resealable bag and works great in my salt mill.  I would buy this again and recommend it to my friends."
1,I use this salt very liberally now especially after finding out that its table salt you really need to avoid.  Our bodies need salt to live and this is the purest kind out there.  I plan to make this salt a part of my regular diet.
1,"I love this salt!!  The delivery was quick, the price was reasonable and the salt imparts a wonderful flavor to everything I eat!  And, it doesn't burn my tongue!  I will be using this salt for ever more!"
1,I absolutely love this salt.  The flavor is awesome and at a great price.  No more box salt for me.
1,I discovered this salt about 2 years ago and have not looked back. I love it. The Spice Lab gives you a high quality product for a great price. It is hard to describe Himalayan salt - you get more salty goodness without using so much. It is delicious!
1,"Great buy!  Fantastic taste and pleasing pink hue from the iron content.  I prefer a grinding salt, and this one is unprocessed for it's better for you."
1,"Can't tell it is any different than normal salt, except for a slight pink tinge. But if it has all the great minerals and stuff... all the better!"
1,"This salt is so tasty!  It tastes nothing like the iodized table salt.  This has a light, mild taste that greatly enhances meats, vegetables, etc.  It's pink/peach color also looks very pretty in my clear Cole/Mason grinder.  It grinds very finely with no issue.  In fact, this salt grinds so finely that it leaves a fine coating, almost like a powder, around the inside of the clear grinder.  If you're a neat freak, this might bug you a little and you might find yourself wiping out the top of the grinder.  Great salt and the bag lasts a long time."
1,Just like in the store for a fraction of the price. I purchased this to refill my expensive pink salt grinder. A million times better than table salt. I don't know if it tastes any different from regular table salt but I think there is something about the shape of the crystals that changes the way the salt hits your tongue. If you have a good grinder I highly recommend checking this stuff out.
1,"This salt is great and way cheaper than any of the local spice shops. It does seem more difficult to grind than other himilayan salts I have tried, but doing a little at a time makes it well worth it. Would i buy it again?? YES"
1,this is a fine example of mineral-rich himalayan salt. The packaging also keeps it fresh. It comes in a zip-seal pouch.
1,Fast service and item was exactly as described. Would purchase from this seller again. They even sent along more information on this salt and others as well as sent me some samples.
1,"This is my kids favorite of the salts at the moment.  I like it too, and will keep it in my collection. Great deal also, and great company to do business with."
1,"The bag was smaller than I expected, but that's probably just me being bad at estimating things.  The salt seems good, however, I was a little disappointed that the photo showed the salt to be much more vibrantly colored than they actually are.  I mean, they are pink, just not so bright pink as it shows.  The salt has a good flavor though.  I'd say it was worth the price."
1,"I got this for work, as I am a cook. Everyone noticed that I have had a change in the flavors of my food. They said it was a good change. Personally I have enjoyed useing the salt in different foods. I do like it very much."
1,"I use this Pink Himalayan course grain salt in salt grinders because it looks great, but also I make my own homemade Herbal Salt using Rosemary, Lemon Thyme and Pink Himalayan course grain salt...tastes great and look great in the grinders and shakers.  I've very satisfied.  I plan on making up some more Herbal Salts for Christmas gifts using this Pink Himalayan salt.  Very satisfied!"
1,"We grind our salt/pepper/spices fresh and this is out salt of choice.  It's milder than regular table salt, which allows for more precise control of how salty you want your foods."
1,"The Spice Lab is a completely wonderful company!!!<br />I received my order promptly. The salt is very high quality and a beautiful pink color.<br />Due to my miscalculation, I ordered crystals that were too big for my grinder.<br />I sent a note and asked if I could exchange it for smaller crystals.<br />Customer service answered quickly and said ""They were sending me a bag of smaller crystals"" completely free.<br />How wonderful of them!!!<br />You don't see that very often these days. I commend Spice Lab for having such wonderful ""customer service!"" I am now a dedicated customer!!! Thank you Spice Lab for my quality salt!! I am going to make ""Sole"" and cook with it every day!!!"
1,"Silly me, I didn't even know there was such a thing as pink Himalayan salt.  A friend actually mentioned it to me as we were discussing moving into a vegetarian life style.  So now, it's like buying a red, Ford Mustang.  It's all you see on the road or, in this case, on the shelves of the stores.<br /><br />I'm actually glad I purchased this and have stopped using regular old white salt almost totally.  The salt does seem to have a milder taste but I don't find myself using any more of it than I did with the good old ""when it rains it pours"" variety.<br /><br />Since ordering this from Amazon, I've managed to find some here in my little town but it is way expensive.  When you purchase this you will also need a salt grinder unless you like throwing big chunks of salt at your food.  Worth getting the two together, however, especially if you purchase a grinder with a glass container as the salt really looks attractive in a pretty, transparent grinder.  And, of course, it tastes good, too.  About it's nutritional value I admit to knowing zip.  Does salt HAVE nutritional value?  In the meantime, I give this four stars.  If I find out more about the actual food value I'll update this review."

1,i put it in a glass jar for chow watmore ken i talk about it is pink salt i resifet it fest
1,"I agree with the other reviewer.  Down at my local grocery store, a can of this sauce is 69 cents, but if you watch for a sale, you can get them 2/$1.  This is, however, an excellent, mild hot sauce for folks who want a bit of heat on their tacos or tostadas, but have taste buds too sensitive for the fiery sauces that are out there.  I've used this sauce for the last 25 years, and love it!"
1,"I make my own enchilada sauce usually, but if I'm pressed for time I go with the El Pato. For a canned sauce, it's pretty darn good."
1,This is great in chili if you want to make it hotter than it would<br />be just with chili powder.
1,"I found out after I purchased the product that it cost me almost 4 times what I could get it for at my local supermarket. Love the product, but I don't have money to throw away by paying a lot more than I needed to."
1,"We used the seasoning last weekend to make some hamburgers. Man, that was the best hamburger I've ever had! This will definitely be a staple in my pantry."
1,"I love it, this Trio is delicious, I am buying to give to my friends, because I liked a lot to eat in my Hamburgers, Salads,beefs,and so on.....and<br />I am taking some of them to take to Brazil for me to eat there!!!<br /><br />  SO DELICIOUS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"I really like this brand of cheese sticks. They have great flavor, not an overwhelming 'chemical cheese' taste, and they don't rely on a ton of salt as do so many other snacks like these. Unfortunately, they came from ""Warehouse Deals"". They are packed by the manufacturer in a box of 12 designed for transport on pallets in semis to stores. That means the manufacturer's packaging is not designed to have a label stuck on it and then be tossed around by UPS, or FedEx, or whomever is delivering it. I received twelve boxes of cheese stick crumbs!!!! DO NOT ORDER IF ""Warehouse Deals"" is the vendor!!!!!!"
1,We can get these crackers locally but the price is a lot higher.  I absolutely love these crackers and they have a deep rich cheese flavor.  I will continue to purchase these crackers from Amazon to complement any holiday.
1,"I've tried to find a good chocolate covered sunflower seeds for so long - I had them when I was young and couldnt find it in the US that easily. The Chocolate covered sunflower seeds from Yankee traders taste really good. The chocolate itself is really good. I can taste sunflower seeds in there but some of my coworker said they couldnt really tell (hance the 4 stars), I guess becasue they are not used to the sunflower seeds taste. I have to put just a little of it next to me or I'll probably eat the whole bag in a few days. Thank you!"
1,"I have been a sardine eater for years and I love my boneless skinless. I have tried a million brands and variations. I have learned a few things.<br /><br />All sardines in this shape tin are from morocco and from the same plants. They are the same exact sardines in seasons, king oscar, etc; so its all about finding the lowest price brand and seller. I fully endorse these sardines and this seller as being an excellent example of service and quality goods. I ordered on friday and got them monday morning with free shipping option.<br /><br />These are boneless and skinless as specified with very minimal salt added. The fish was fresh even for my ridiculous standards, the olive oil was of good quality with the fish very well marinated, and the oil goes good with cooking or with good french bread and balsamic vinegar."
1,"What a pleasure to have found truly skinless and boneless sardines with a great, delicate flavor -- and in LIGHT olive oil.  Delicious.  Much better than supermarket brands which are often too strong in taste and scent.  I've saved some money by subscribing to delivery every other month, but may have to increase it to monthly. Cento is a good brand -- their tuna is delicious, too."
1,"I've tried myriad of different brands, the last one being Crown Prince which were floating in oil, literally. Not much of a meal unless you consider drinking that olive oil filling. The cans arrived a bit dirty so make sure to wash them before opening. The package it arrived in looked like it's been sitting on a shelf for ages, but the actual sardines are very good!! The can is packed, I'd say 6-8 sardines and a lot less oil. Still enough to pour over salad. They don't taste fishy, unlike the Season's brand, and are salty enough to no need for additional salt. Just a splash of lemon and voila...delicious over salad greens or with a boiled egg for breakfast. This one is a keeper and I'll be ordering more soon."
1,Mild flavor. Excellent quality. Too many sardine manufacturers sell a substandard product. I wouldn't think twice about serving these to guests.<br /><br />They are very good and can be used in any recipe requiring sardines as the mild flavor isn't overpowering or too fishy.
1,"I've tried a bunch of different sardines from Amazon and these are the best I've tried though I haven't tried any of the more expensive ones. Nice taste and the texture is very good. The texture is what I hate about sardines packed in water. These are well worth the cost. I had one box with a problem with the can. The first box was fine but on the second box of these and for every can in that box the pull ring popped off and I had to open the can with my pocket knife which isn't easy once the ring is gone. I found that you just have to punch through the opening seam right in front of the ring then they open fine. Kind of messy though. So if you take these to work like I do be sure and have a secondary way to open the can just in case.<br /><br />Edit: I still say these are the best for the price but I have found some sardines I like a good bit better, Bela sardines.  However they are more expensive at $4 a can from Amazon but I found them for $3 locally."
0,"Package arrived stamped ""received in damaged condition"" or something to that effect.  So Amazon recieved it from a third party, Cento Fine Foods, damaged and clearly leaking sardine oil, and delivered it to me anyhow.  What's up with that?  Upon opening, I found one of the 25 cans smashed - think pureed sardines all over the other cans - and 4 more cans badly dented.  So I really received 20 cans for the price of 25.  I hope they're reeaalllly tasty.  I guess it's better to avoid purchasing some things online.<br />UPDATE - Amazon rocks!  I have been told that they will be replacing damaged cans. (Hope they arrive in one piece)<br /><br />UPDATE 2-<br />Seller replaced my sardines!! I will certainly order them again knowing seller will replace broken cans.  Why can't I update my rating to 5?"
1,"OK, while recognizing that many people don't like sardines, I am one who does.  But I don't like bones and skin very much.  I find the boned, skinned version more palatable. These are tasty, well packed, and just right for a low-calorie snack.  I like them drained, sprinkled with lemon, and lightly salted.  I recommend these."
1,"These are so good tasting that I decided to subscribe for them.  I will only eat boneless and skinless sardines in olive oil, and I can't easily find them where I live.  The price on these is great too.  I feel like a winner!"
1,"Funny to think one can have a ""favorite sardine brand"" but I do and these are it.<br /><br />Not too salty, lots of fish per can, and olive oil is tasty.  I mash the lot up with hot sauce and eat it all.  Or I dump it on a salad and dress with a little balsamic on the top.  Not very fishy and a great product.  I get them on subscribe and save every few months and suggest them to all my paleo-diet friends."
1,"Just packed in there with delicious oil and not salty at all.  I eat them plain with lemon and cook them into all kinds of meals.  I read other reviews about the can top breaking so I have always just been careful when opening them and had no problems yet.  I even feed the extra oil to my dog, he loves it!  Very similar to tuna in taste, not overly fishy probably because no skin.  A good buy at this price & I will do it again."
1,"I am a sardine lover from way back, but have to eat them sparingly as my wife often threatens to throw me out of the house if I eat them when she's home.  However, in a fit of weakness and husbandly sneakiness I ordered these based on the previous Amazon reviews.  They are just as good as I had hoped - a very mild, pleasant flavor, firm flesh and excellent olive oil.  They are a little less salty than most sardines I have tried, which is good or bad depending on what you prefer.  If you prefer a very intense, smokey sardine flavor, these ones probably aren't for you.  They are excellent dumped on top of a salad, with no salad dressing necessary.  Most of the cans have been packed tightly with fish and just the right amount of oil.  And, wonder of wonders, even my wife has deemed them worthy of human consumption.<br /><br />I know other reviewers had some issues with the packaging or opening the cans.  These arrived in good condition, and all of the cans so far have opened perfectly.  I would definitely recommend them and plan on ordering more when this case runs out."
1,"These Sardines are delicious with just the right amount of salt and olive oil.  Nothing goes to waste here, I stir in the oil for a salad-like consistency, then onto the Crackers...Marvelous! I sometimes eat them right out of the can-just like that!"
1,We are filling our larder for the coming depression.  Sardines keep well and belong in anyone's iron rations.
1,"the product is very good,i love it,it arrive in very good condition,well pleased with the product and with amazon."
1,"Sardines provide a healthy option to a diet.  Being headless, skinless, and boneless they are delicious."
1,One of the two health choice soups that I eat on a regular basis.  (This and Chicken with Rice).  Tasty soup with relatively low (or lower) sodium than others.  I add some baked goldfish as extra substance when eating it for lunch.  Soup is good food.  :)
1,"Great taste. The only neg I have is when in microware the bowl ""pops"" a few time. This causes the bowl to jump slightly in the air. On a rotating platform if not in the middle it can turn over creating a big mess. Keep it in the center and keep an eye on it."
1,"This makes a great quick meal whether your in school or anywhere, just pop this in the microwave! There is plenty of meat,potatoes, but lacks carrots and peas. It tastes great except there is a slight sourness to the soup. I guess thats why it has less sodium compared to regular can soups."
0,"Not a good soup for the microwave.  Something in the soup or in the container design causes the soup to explode (top flies off and soup everywhere) or causes the container to jump around like a Mexican jumping bean, many times landing on it's side and draining cold soup throughout the microwave. I have tried in different brands of microwave and experienced the same issues.  I place container on paper plate, and cover container with many sheets of paper towel.  Sometimes this contains the mess, but often the force of the explosion will throw paper towels to the side and the eruption coats the inside of the microwave."
1,"This is totally not an everyday food. This is the kind of food that you buy, secretly so your friends at the Co-op won't judge you. You never share that you have bought them with your mom's groups lest you fear being judged for your inferior parenting. You hide them in your pantry, hoping your husband and children don't stumble across them and beg for a taste. You can feel your arteries clogging with the artificial flavorings, colorants and thickeners. You know there are byproducts of petroleum distillates masquerading as food, but still, that first bite. Heavenly bliss.<br />Then you hide the wrapper while ruing it's conception. That swimsuit won't fit, but it's secretly worth it."
1,"They are so hard to find in the local supermarkets by my house! I came across them at Bakers, and I'm glad I did. Although these aren't the healthiest snacks in the bunch, my taste buds are what matter. These are the best! It's soft, but crispy frosted breading with a big, fluffy chocolate pudding pile inside. They are totally worth the price and I would eat them everyday if I could. I don't know what the idiotic person who gave it a 1-star review was smoking, but this is so great tasting and sure as heck could be even unhealthier. It's not that bad if you only have 2 or so a week. The good thing about them is it has a good source of fiber and dome different vitamins. I have loved these all my life, and that won't change. I about melted when I took my first bite. I could've ate the pack of 5 in a day! You won't regret buying these if you like frosting and chocolaty pudding that tastes a little like fudge. If I could give them any higher of a star, trust me I would!"
0,"This Hostess Chocolate Pudding Pie literally has a laundry-list of bad and even worse ingredients  and reads like a chemistry problem. Let's start with enriched wheat flour, vegetable(s) oil shortening - including partially hydrogenated oil(s), corn syrup, plus high fructose corn syrup, plus-plus more sweetener as sugar, modified corn starch, soy protein isolate, even more vegetable(s) oils as partially hydrogenated, beef fat. Now blend in some titanium dioxide, artificial flavors and food colors yellow 5 and red 40. Do you really want this ""food"" around for your kids to eat? Not recommended in my world."
1,"I ran across avitae 45 mg, and 90 mg, about a year ago and have found it to be an excellent product and alternative to my morning coffee.  It has cut my soda consumption down dramatically.  In the office people are always asking me what it is as the packaging is very cool too.  I highly recommend avitae, and the 4 pack provides a great way to sample to product.  Thanks,"
1,This product is great for using in any lasagna - even those who are not gluten-free cannot tell the difference between this and normal pasta. The only drawback here is that it does take it about 45 minutes or longer to cook fully in the oven. I usually boil mine for a little bit to cut down on the cooking time in the oven. This pasta is really great about not falling apart while cooking or handling which is a huge plus. Love it - a must have for the gluten-free!
1,"I buy this lasagna by the case from Amazon, and with free shipping it's a deal. I don't precook the pasta, I just lay it in the dish along with the rest of the ingredients and it comes out perfectly.<br /><br />I guess it's to be expected, but there is always some breakage of the noodle in the box, so I have to piece together a number of smaller pieces at the end, but it still comes out nicely. Having lived without lasagna for about 10 years, (it's hard to find gluten free lasagna noodles in grocery stores near me), this has been a real treat for me. I now get an auto-shipped case every three months and the price and convenience can't be beat."
1,"I'm making lasagna much more often now that I've discovered this great product!  Not having to precook the noodles is a huge time saver, so it's become one of my new easy to fix meals.  It goes together quickly, then pop it in the oven for 45 minutes and it's done.  Going through a case from Amazon is not a problem at all, and as soon as they offer it again with free shipping, I'll be buying more!  I never have liked the taste of whole wheat pasta, and this whole grain rice pasta tastes so much better.  We like the taste better if I greatly decrease or omit the salt that I used to add to my lasagna recipe."
1,"My daughter is gluten free, but our entire family likes this pasta.  My husband claims it is not as heavy feeling as some pasta is.  Even my picky teenager likes it.  The fact that you don't have to boil it is a plus.  The first two times I used it, I was worried that it would not cook through, but that was not an issue at all. You can't go wrong with this product."
1,"Having developed a wheat allergy, I have really been missing lasagna and other pastas - always on the search for something that tastes even remotely ""normal"", I am pleased to say this is great! Recommend!"
0,"This was a big waste of money, both for the product itself and because it ruined an entire pan of lasagne.  The noodles were no-boil (which generally I'm not a big fan of because they are still tough), but the convenience was great.  After baking the lasagne at 375 for one hour, the noodles were still very tough, yet at the same time they absolutely crumbled apart in your mouth and didn't act at all like a typical lasagne noodle.  Out of our family of four, only my husband was able to finish his serving, but he even admitted that he didn't like it."
0,I make lasagna for our annual family gathering so I was excited that I found a GF  lasagna noodle so I could eat the same dish as the family. I typically pre-boil my noodles but the instructions on the rice noodles said no boiling was needed. So I made my recipe and refrigerated it for 2 days as usual. I cooked it for 50 min let it stand for 10 min before serving. I was disappointed that the texture was mushy - not the same firmness as the wheat pasta noodles. Perhaps it would have worked better if I made it immediately before cooking and cooked it for a shorter time.
1,This Jerky is DELICIOUS! FULL of flavor and moist! One of the BEST tasting Jerky I've ever put in my mouth! two thumbs up!
1,"If you enjoy a softer style jerky this one is for you. Consistent month after month. Sweet to hot is spot on.Every person I have shared with loved it...Buy ! Buy,"
1,"I have tryed a lot of Beef Jerky but, I must say this is the ""greatest"" I have eaten..Just try it you will say the same...finger licking good! and it does'nt chew like a piece of leather either...<br />  Bettie In Ohio"
0,The tast is good but it's the beef jerky that has the most fat in it I have ever tasted.
0,"Bought this along with a lot of other jerky to test out and after about two weeks it went moldy.<br /><br />No, it's not salt. It's fuzzy and green and hairy.<br /><br />Tasted fine while it lasted. Pretty standard pepper jerky. Didn't try it after it went moldy..."
0,"The flavor was very good for this product but the texture is far too soft. I had read that and was looking for a softer, easier to chew jerky but this is not a jerky texture at all.<br /><br />It was more like cooked steak strips thank jerky."
0,"Probably one of the worst jerky products I've ever tasted. It was almost gelatinous in texture and waxy. I think this is the result of being over tenderized. Perhaps this is a good product for those with dental problems or dentures, but for others, you may want to stick to another jerky brand."
1,"If you are one of the beef jerky lovers who really enjoys the soft tangyness of beef jerky that is most resembled in terriaki flavored beef jerky, you should know that it is extremely hard to find such kinds. Sometimes it's just sheer luck that you get a bag of the same texture you want. To me, I felt that this beef jerky wasn't as good as some of them but definitely better than a lot of the main brands out there. This bag, has a LOT of beef jerky, and it is somewhat soft. However, it isn't like chewy/tangy and is still a little dry. Some people like it, but to me the texture is not great. The flavor profile though is delicious."
0,"Bought a bag of the hickory smoked flavor, and this stuff was salty enough that you could throw it on the driveway to melt ice.  Great price if that's how you like it, but I've had just about every type of Jerky commonly available along with a few that aren't, and this is by far the saltiest of any I've tried."
1,"whenever Amazon sells Jerky under $1 per ounce, I always like to sample it.  I recall seeing this brand at my local Target over $1.50 per ounce (BTW - Target's $1/oz house brand Pepper Jerky is great).  I tried Wild Ride's Peppered and Hickory, since sweeter flavored Jerky are rarely done right.  Peppered is always a safe flavor to try since few makers can screw that up, and this one did not disappoint - very nice balance of pepper and smoke without downing it in salt.  the Hickory tasted like pickled meat with a strong dill and parsley aftertaste, while being way too salty and moist.  both had about the same gristle percentage than that cheap import Amazon sells from World Kitchens Jerky.  If you like your Jerky drier, just leave it in the fridge in an open bag for a few days.  I'd call the Pepper a 3 star jerky, and the Hickory 2 star jerky, that both earn a bonus star as long as it's available under $1/oz.  One annoying thing about the package - the ingredients list is microscopic - sort of makes you wonder what they are hiding..."
0,"Compared to Pacific Gold beef jerky, this beef jerky is way too salty! You have to drink a glass of water for every piece of jerky you eat.  It's also a littler drier and less tender than other beef jerky.  I would recommend trying other brands of beef jerky and staying away from this unless you want to develop early high blood pressure."
1,"Really liked the taste.  Did not have any ""tough/stringy"" pieces in any of the my 4 packages.<br />Tried this on a special deal, so price was very good (always want more for less ;^).  Normal prices seem competative w/Costco/Sams Club items."
1,"Like others I ordered this on a lightning deal and it's great value.<br />I gave four stars for flavor and freshness, it IS some of the best jerky I've tasted.<br />I was a little disappointed however, the first bag and first few pieces were moist, soft and really good, then the next couple of pieces were like rawhide, with some obvious jerked gristle, which took some serious chewing, and detracted from the quality of the rest in the bag.<br />I thought this was a one off, but the second and third bag have been the same, mostly soft and satisfying, but about 25% smokey boot leather.<br />I don't know whether it's quality control, but it seems like ""pot luck"" with what's in the bag.<br />All that said, I haven't had the jaw ache I get from the popular brands so it's still good..........just not perfect."
0,Some of the jerkey is chewey and hard to eat. I am a big fan of jack links beef jerkey. I wouldnt buy again because so many pieces are hard to eat being chewy or vainy. Ah well have 3 more packs to give a try. The price was good but still I personally couldn't eat 1 out of 3 pieces. Could be just spoiled with others i guess.
0,"This jerky tastes okay, but it seems like this isn't made from the best quality meat.  I don't know if I got a bad batch, but all the jerky I ate had hard veins running through them. All in all, I would give 2.5 stars, but since I can't, and I don't like rounding up, I have to go with 2.<br /><br />PROS:<br />The Jerky is tender, but not overly tender.  It is a good consistancy (except for the occassional tough fiber running through them).<br /><br />CONS:<br />The quality of the meat was sub par, which says a lot, since you don't need the best cuts to make jerky (its basically dried ground meat).  As the other reviewers pointed out, the package says the beef could be from USA or from a variety of other countries.  I'm pretty certain mine didn't come from the US.<br /><br />NEUTRAL:<br />The flavor was okay.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special either.  There are many other jerkys out there that have outstanding flavor."
1,"I was kinda skeptic about these, i ordered them, they smelled a bit funny but i ate them anyways, i'm not a big fan of hickory but these were alright for the price..."
0,"This Jerky is close, but not quite as good as good as other pre-packaged bags you can get at the gas station.  It's tender and substantial, so points there.  The flavor though is mediocre at best; poor would be a fair description.<br /><br />Also, if you open the bag it will grow mold in a few days.  Maybe this is a problem with other brands of jerky too.  I wouldn't know because this is the first time I have opened a bag and not eaten it relatively quickly (see above's flavor comments).<br /><br />All in all, this isn't very good jerky."
0,"like others i read the ""great"" reviews and this is not very good tasting jerky, i had a few people try it and nobody liked it but its not a total loss. My Dog Loves it!!"
0,"I have bought from this seller before and had no problems.  This last order I opened before I went on vacation for two weeks.  The texture of the beef jerky was different in this order than the ones that I had bought before.  After returning from vacation, when I opened the package, there was a very non-pleasant odor.  Upon inspecting the jerky, I found that several pieces contained mold on them.  What I have now is over a half pound of very expensive dog treats. While I would be willing to try this product again, as I have bought it before and this is the first problem I have had, there is no easy way of contacting the seller. The product is also listed as non-returnable, so while my dog is extremely happy - I am not."
1,"This is really good jerky. The pieces are nice and thick and have just enough gristle in it to leave you with something to chew for a while. That's half the reason I like jerky. This actually helps the bag last longer since you don't rush right onto the next piece! It has a barbeque coating with a good flavor and a semi-spicy after bite. The pieces are thick enough that they don't disintegrate in the bag so that the last half of the bag isn't smaller ""crumbs"". I'd buy this again and as a matter of fact I think I will right now!"
0,"The following is just my opinion so take it for what it's worth.  I suppose some reviewers actually liked this, but I have to say without any doubt whatsoever, this is absolutely the WORST jerky I've ever tried.  I've grown up on the stuff, and I like a real cowboy beef jerky.  This stuff is soft, kind of falls apart in your mouth, and I'm sorry just plain TERRIBLE.  If you like a good jerky that you can chew on a while, this isn't it."
1,The flavor of the sweet & hot is the best spicy jerky I have yet to find. It is also very tender. The only issue I have is sometimes you get quite a few pieces in a row that have alot of grisel in them.
0,"First off, it was disgustingly difficult to tear the jerky with my teeth, unlike the other flavor, sweet and hot.<br /><br />Then after LITERALLY 1 after week there was fuzzies on the jerky. You buy a 1 lb. bag so it lasts, right? I didn't realize what it was so I ate a little bit anyways. Then another week goes by - I'm talking about with the bag sealed completely up - and there is a crap ton of white and green mold all over the jerky.<br /><br />They had it on sale because it expired 10 years ago.<br /><br />OH AND YOU CAN'T GET A REFUND :P"
1,"There was a sale on Wild Ride Beef Jerky, so I decided to try it out. They did not have the flavors I wanted, but the original was good. Large strips of meat that actually looked like pieces of meat and not reformed into synthetic looking ones. Overall, I would buy from them again."
0,"I bought this beef jerky and received it a couple of days after on 1/6/11. Less than a month later, there was a lot of mold inside the unopened bag. The bag was still sealed, with an expiration date of 5/29/12. Needless to say: stay away from this product!!!!!!!"
1,"I'm hesitant to give this too good of a review, because I don't want the whole world buying it and then the price goes up.  BUT, this jerky is truly the best.  I've found that all the Wild Ride Jerky is fresh and easy to chew...it is very tender.  Hickory is by far the best Wild Ride flavor and I would eat it over Jack Links everyday!  Don't listen to the idiots giving this bad reviews, saying that it was stale or moldy.  This is what happens when you leave any kind of jerky out for 2+ weeks people!  Any way, just thought I'd chime in with an honest review.  Hope you dig this jerky (and price) as much as I do!"
0,"The price is cheap for a reason. This is some of the toughest jerky that i've ever had, and I've been eating jerky for over 35 years. Too much dried fat to be able to pull the stuff apart with your teeth. Flavor was good on about 50% of the pieces. The others had little or none. I think this stuff would be much better suited as a dog treat for a small breed. For me, it's pretty awful.<br /><br />I also got a bag of the peppered type. That review is pending."
0,This jerky is not as good as Jack Links. The texture is good but the flavor is not good at all. I would not buy it again.
0,"bought two bags and at the time the details did not include the ingredients. says ""naturally"" not once but twice on the bag. am allergic to monosodium glutamate so this stuff might as well be guano. better-half ate half a bag and EVERY piece of it eaten was full of silverskin."
1,"These are excellent cuts of meat, soft and chewy.  Bold pepper taste but not overpowering.  I get a bag once a month on the subscribe and save offer."
1,"Got this for my husband for Christmas and he LOVES it! Im finding myself sneaking some and we both look forward to trying the next bag since I signed him up for monthly shippings! Altho I havent figured out how to change the flavors, Im sure its with Amazon and not the Wild Ride company. Wouldnt bother either of us to get the same but would love to try all the flavors. Got a great deal and very happy with the quality and amount! Very tender, great flavor and filling as a snack! Husband is looking forward to baseball season to finally have some great jerky to snack on during the games! Recommend to all and makes a great gift that keeps giving!"
1,"I'm not too sure about some of the negative reviews.  This is a good, basic, beef jerky.  Thicker than some, but good tender strips of meat.  Not hard to chew at all, good taste and an overall solid value.  Definitely beats some of the brands available at your local grocery."
1,"Definitely a moister, kippered-style jerky.  Not the ultra dry kind that makes your teeth hurt.  I can see why some might find it too ""oily"", as I have found brands like that before.<br /><br />But it definitely works here, at least with the Sweet and Hot.  I haven't tried the other flavors.<br /><br />And it's not too sweet or too hot.  Kinda like a Chinese spare rib, without the bone.  I'd buy more."
1,Good jerky overall. Maybe people earlier got a bad batch. A little salty but not too overwhelming. BBQ flavor tastes good. Jerky is soft and chewy and cut into big pieces. Cant beat the price. 4/5
0,"I don't like my jerky too tender so this is right for me, except for one problem: TOO SALTY. I can barely taste the meat's flavor for all that salt. It's like eating salt with meat flavor."
1,"Store-bought jerky tends to be an excellent source of jaw exercise, but this jerky reminds me much more of the products available at our local farmer's markets.  Excellent flavor (purchased the hickory, trying original next), and an awesome price for such large qauntity.  It's nice to see actual texture and strip size variations, vs. the new ""pressed square beef-like product"" now being sold as jerky in many bags.<br /><br />My fiance mentioned upon trying her first piece that it doesn't taste like store-bought.  I recommend this if you're a jerky fanatic struggling to find a good price/quality ratio!"
0,sometimes it feels like chewing on paper..flavor is not very good either...will not recommend it again..
1,This is one of my favorite jerkys.  I like the Hickory best of all.  If you like jerky check out this review:<br /><br />[...]
0,"I purchased this jerky about a month ago, I was under the impression that this was a real jerky.  This was extremely moist, and like almost wet with no texture to it.  After just 4 days in the opened zipped shut bag the meat grew fungus and funky white blooms.  I will never buy again!!!"
1,"I ordered the 16oz Cowboy Strips Original, the product arrived promptly, and this is some of the best jerky I've had. Reminds me of a brand (long forgotten) I loved as a kid (1960's).<br />This Jerky is not too sweet and with a hard texture like Jack Links, Oberto, and the store brands. Nice salty taste, thicker strips, tender (for Jerky) texture. The one pound size is a great value too.<br /><br />I ordered two more pounds of Cowboy Strips, Pepper and Original right away.<br /><br />I hope you plan to continue to offer the 16oz bags. I will definately be a loyal customer.<br /><br />Thanks for a great product!"
1,"This is pretty good jerky, it goes really well with a  few beers. Smells kind of funky tho... It's also a little moist for me. I like my jerky dry and stringy, but it is proper jerky. It's not that chopped and formed stuff, and it is really tasty.<br /><br />All in all, for the price, I haven't found any better..."

0,"I'm a self-proclaimed connoisseur of beef jerky, I have probably eaten a wheelbarrow full of different brands. This ""Wild Ride"" is the toughest cut I have ever come across. You have to chew, chew, chew, and chew! Couple pieces and your jaw is too sore to complain much. No date on the bag, contacted manufacturer by email, thought maybe I got some old stock...no reply. Great taste, but too tough!"
0,I ordered this along with other Beef Jerky for my neice for Chirstmas.  She loves the stuff.  Well when she opened this package it was moldy. It's to much of a hassel to return it so I had her to just trash it.  I'll buy food stuffs from a store and not online next time.
0,Hope you have sharp teeth cause this jerky is tougher than your grandpas leather shoes. I broke a darn tooth eating this gator hide like jerky.<br />You get what you pay for with this product. I bought this jerky to save a couple bucks now I have to spend $1300 to get my darn tooth fix.
0,"I love beef jerky but this is not good in any way.  It's very, very fatty, greasy to the touch and too bland.  Maybe under cooked or something??  It's chewy, not tough chewy but chewy like chicken chewy.  Didn't come on site to write a review but to contact the seller about a refund/return but since I don't think I can, thought I'd warn you so you aren't disappointed like me :("
0,"The Hickory was very salty, so much so that I ended up throwing it away. The regular, Barbaque, sweet and hot were all very good. I will be reordering them soon again."
0,nothing about this jerky stands out.  might as well buy a pack at the gas station rather than have a 4 pack of this.
0,"I am so disappointed. I also had the mold issue a lot of reviews were talking about. Since I paid for it I found a piece that wasn't touching the mold and tried it. I'm daring I know. The beef jerky was very tender. I know some might like that, but I like it a little rough. That's how beef jerky is supposed to be. The flavor was also really bad, but that is probably from the mold. I think the issue is the moisture. It makes it tender, but it is also leading to the mold issues a lot of people are experiencing. I won't order this brand again, which is a shame because it was a great price for the amount of jerky."
0,"tastes disgusting; when you bite into it, there's a great chance you could be biting into a chunk of fat..I tried the sweet and spicy and hickory, and they both had the same outcome..go elsewhere for some quality beef jerky!"
0,WILD RIDE WAS A LOT BETTER WHEN I STARTED EATING IT A FEW YEARS BACK. THE NEW PURCHASE OF SEVERAL BAGS (ATE TWO SO FAR) HAS BEEN DISAPPOINTING. FLAVOR PROFILE HAS CHANGED AND PRODUCT IS TOUGH AND DRY. GOING TO LOOK FOR A NEW REPLACEMENT BRAND. TOO BAD. PROBABLY GOT TOOK FOR A WILD RIDE (CRASHING) WITH THIS PURCHASE.
0,"I was excited to try this jerkey and ripped the box open as soon as it arrived. Sadly, the flavor is just so-so. More critically, the meat is extremely tough. Not tough the way jerky should be, but tough the way a hamburger that gets left on the BBQ for a couple hours is.<br />Very disappointed I couldn't return this because of Amazon policy. I hardly ever return anything, but this wasn't even worth the free shipping"
0,"I've tried all the flavors at least once.  Original and Teriyaki multiple times.  First batch of Original and Teriyaki was great, 2nd and 3rd batches too over-flavored.  Pepper was too peppery (and I love pepper).  Hickory was too strong/salty.  Just not consistent.  Not going to waste more money on this product."
0,"I ordered the product a few weeks ago, and the beef jerky is very hard to tear and chew.  Some of them were like rubber, and it just took forever.  I would not buy it again.  Kind of disappointed at it."
0,"By now I've eaten half the bag so I know what's in here. Sure, their beef jerky is pretty tender. But for some reason they decided to throw in an insane amount of salt. I've had store-bought beef jerky and I've had quality Amazon beef jerky and this is definitely the saltiest by at least double. The first time I ate this, I could only handle 2 strips before I had to put it down again. My friend made a disgusted face and refused to have another bite. Luckily I am a salt lover so I can at least tolerate the extreme saltiness. But it's still too salty.<br /><br />Next up is the gristle. Sometimes amidst the generally tender bites there will be a mat of unchewable mass that I pretty much have to spit out or swallow whole. It happens more often than other brands and definitely more than I care for. Secondly, I don't know if it's the salt playing tricks on me, but the texture and taste is a bit worse than other brands, like they use lower quality jerky.<br /><br />Overall I believe that Wild Ride is less quality than most other brands, even when you factor in the low price. There are similarly priced brands that are of higher quality and lower sodium content. I don't know why they sell so well. Personally my next bulk order beef jerky will be with someone else."
0,"Not a bad taste, maybe too sweet.  The pieces are fairly thick, it felt like chewing on a piece of thick slightly undercooked bacon.  Meat quality seemed good when you did not find a stringy things.  Needs to be cooked longer."
0,"I got a couple bags of Wild Ride Original and I now cannot believe the 5-star reviews. The positive is that it is moist and not dry, which is what I like, but I had to throw out at least half the package because so many pieces were unchewable. It was worth a try, but a mistake I won't make again."
0,"I ordered this product because it was described as ""all-natural with no chemical preservatives"" and the gold box price price was good.  It arrived quickly, as usual for Amazon, and it tastes good.  But, it's not ""all-natural with no chemical preservatives"" unless you consider sodium nitrite and partially hydrogenated vegetable oil to fall under that description.  I would consider ordering it again if it weren't for the artificial ingredients.<br /><br />How do they get away with suggesting that there are no artificial preservatives (sodium nitrite) in this stuff?  Sodium nitrite has been linked to migraines and colon cancer and has been used as a poison in larger quantities."
1,"When I first encountered these Cowboy Strips I as a bit confused. Were they in fact made of beef or cowboy? Since cannibalism hasn't generally been in practice for quite some time (and even when it was, only by savages of the worst sort), I felt it was quite likely that the 'beef' mentioned in the title was the meat source, but it wasn't out of the realm of possibility to believe these to be beef flavored COWBOY strips made from real life cowboys. That thought caused my stomach to turn, and because I take great pride in leading a cannibalism free lifestyle, I decided it might be wise to contact the manufacturers of WILD RIDE just to double check--similarly I once contacted the makers of the very confusingly named 'chicken of the sea' brand tuna fish to see if it was chicken or fish; quite an important distinction! Better safe than sorry over having broken my nearly 30 year streak of cannibalism avoidance in one fell swoop, I gave WILD RIDE a call!<br /><br />Thankfully, WILD RIDE confirmed that this was in fact BEEF jerky, and that the Cowboy reference in the title was just an adjective explaining the sort of jerky it is: long, thin strips that are chewable, soft, and very, very tasty. I suggested that they rename it ""Wild Ride Beef Jerky Cowboy Strips (NOT MADE FROM COWBOYS. NO COWBOYS INJURED IN THE MAKING OF THIS JERKY)"" and they agreed such a change could potentially be useful. Much obliged for their assistance in understanding their product and their intentions (after all if they WERE selling COWBOY jerky, it might call into question what sort of operation they run, and if they are in-fact a Zombie enterprise!) I was able to enjoy all four bags of this jerky in about 30 minutes. Wishing I had more, I took a stroll to the outhouse because I suddenly wasn't feeling that well, and the next thirty minutes I spent thinking about what a great movie you could make about a Zombie owned corporation selling COWBOY JERKY to the unknowing public. I couldn't decide if I'd prefer to have Chuck Norris or Steven Seagal play the protagonist (or possibly pair them up!) or if the ending would involve a nuclear warhead wiping out the zombies or just let Chuck and Stev-o whack them apart with machetes, but at least these unanswered questions successfully distracted me from the 3.1 magnitude earthquake that was shaking the entire outhouse.<br /><br />So put your mind at ease: these are BEEF strips made in the cowboy fashion, and they're very, very tasty!"
0,"Tastes great, but has MSG and partially hydrogenated vegetable oil.  It's my fault for forgetting to check ingredients before ordering--but seriously, it should be unthinkable and illegal to use such chemicals in our food."
0,"Please understand, that when I take the time and write a review, I am very truthful and sincere.  I am not in a contest to see how many reviews that I can<br />write.  However,  I am trying to help the people not to waste their money on a product.  This peppered beef jerky, is without a shadow, the nastiest jerky<br />that I have ever tasted.  I know about jerky.  I make jerky myself sometimes.  This jerky is like chewing on a piece of ""Fat Back"", you have to wipe<br />the grease off your chin and hands after trying to eat it. I don't believe that is 97% fat free.  You can wring the grease out of it.  These comments<br />that I am making are concerning the package that I received.  Other people who commented highly on this product, must have received a much different<br />product than I received or has never eaten any real beef jerky.<br /><br />The package was made in the U.S is all the information that I can find concerning the product. Doesn't say where the beef is from or any info of this<br />nature.  I will not eat this beef jerky, it is sickening.  Take heed people, if you want and like jerky, DO NOT buy whatever this stuff is............"
0,I ordered 2 packages of the 1 LB Jerky and I had to return it because it was too salty to be eaten. This is the worst beef jerky I ever ate! Please save your mouth and taste buds and skip this jerky.
0,I bought this on a crazy deal i think for like $8.00 and it was horrible.  I ended up throwing it away!
0,"It has MSG.  That was not mentioned on any of the description nor on the manufacture's web-site.  Other than that, it tasted okay and the texture was average."
0,"The hickory flavor is repulsive.  I wound up throwing away 5.75 bags worth from my 6 bag order because not even the vultures at my office would eat this crap.  The texture of the beef is dry and mealy with almost a powdery quality to it.  Not moist, not tender, not flavorful, just disgusting."
0,This is the worst beef jerky I have ever tasted. It was not dried as expected and very mushy an tasted nothing like teryaki flavor that I purchased. I recommend staying away from this product.
1,"I prefer jerky on the tender side, so I really enjoyed the original Wild Ride natural style, but I also don't have any hangups about additives, so the new Cowboy Strips line totally blows away the flavor of the bigger brands I'm used to; same tenderness as the organic Wild Ride stuff, but with even more taste.  And if you haven't tried the Pepper yet, you're missing out!"
0,I purchased this item based on the description that stated all natural ingredients and no nitrite. Once I got it I happily consumed it before finding out it did contain sodium nitrite.  As far as I am concerned Amazon should not be distributing wrongly advertised products like this. A big disappointment.
1,"This is the most favorful, beef jerky that I have ever had.  Shared it with the 2 college age kids and they loved it!  yeah"
1,Wild Ride Beef Jerkey is incredibly tender and flavorful.  Most jerky products I've tried in the past are like flavored shoe leather - WFBJ is definitely heads and shoulders above all the others.  There's actually some substance to it - and the fact that it's low fat with NO preservatives is a big selling point for me!  If you like spicey - try the Black Pepper one ------
1,"This is real beef jerky that tastes like meat, has good texture and is fun to snack on. I order several packages to come monthly on a subscription basis as my kids and I love this healthy snack.  You know the stuff they sell at 7-11 they claim is beef jerky?  Well, this is how this one is different:<br /><br />1. The meat has great texture.  It is chewy, not brittle. You tear bites off with your teeth.<br />2. The quality of the meat itself is quite good. Not too many fatty pieces - it tastes like beef, not chemicals.<br />3. Unless you order teriyaki, the jerky is not sweet. Original flavor is just a tad spicy, but tolerable for kids. It's what we always get.<br />4. It does not have an infinite shelf life.  I found it go bad within a month or two. Bad for nuclear winter. Great for a healthy snack.  :-)<br /><br />I love the little packages inside the big one. The jerky stays fresh longer.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
1,"I loved it during my early pregnancy, and it is really a life saver as a great snack!<br />My hubby loved it, too!"
0,"Honestly and simply, this product was not a good one. Certainly not good based on my personal experience.<br /><br />The beef jerky was so extremely tough and difficult to chew. (Many pieces were so tough that they were literally inedible.)  Additionally, I ordered the teriyaki jerky and it had a very weak or light flavor."
0,"This jerky was very inconsistent. The first piece I ate was extremely tough and flavorless. The second was soft and almost mushy. Maybe a tenth of the bag was good jerky, the rest was just awful."
0,I bought this jerkey for the first time and really disappointed about its taste. It is too salty and tasted very old. I can't believe that they shipped to me a very old jerky. The shipment was delay too. I'll not buy it again from this company
1,"I have tried many many many beef jerky products but this WILD RIDE beef jerky is the best tasting product I have ever eaten.  It is both flavorful and moist and gave me the protein boost that I look for in my beef jerky snack.  I also liked the price, very affordable.  The shipping was quick.  I will order this product again and again..."

1,"Altho I did get a bite or two, I have to admit that hubby and son got most of what I ordered.  Hubby commented that the jerky wasn't too chewy and delicious.  Son loved it--said it was the best he's tried--I guess that means that it wins out over mine?"
1,"I bought this out of curiosity and out of the fact that I was just craving some jerky. The original flavor has a mild peppery taste to it and it's really tasty. It's mostly tender, but there are some strips of meat that have beef tendons, making the strips really hard to chew. Yes, there does seem to be some sort of ""grit"" in the beef jerky, but I'm not really too bothered by it. The other thing I don't like about this is that there are sometimes (just sometimes) strips of meat that have no flavor. But overall, I think this was a pretty good buy. I might buy it again, but only after I try some other brands."
1,Wild Ride Jerky is definitely my favorite jerky on the market right now. This jerky is great because it is not only a healthier alternative to many other beef jerkies on the market but the taste is far superior.  I'll never go back to the other brands!
1,"this is a wonderful, tasty beef jerky.  i buy it for my son in new york because he loves beef jerky and he said this wild ride beef jerky was the best.  i am very pleased with this purchase and will continue to buy.,"
0,"I really wanted to like this product but sadly, I hated it.<br /><br />The texture was weird. Some pieces were almost ""pre-chewed"" in texture while others were so tough and full of gristle you couldn't eat them.<br /><br />The smell was just foul. I ordered the Teriyaki flavor and have never smelled anything like this before. It smelled rotten, rancid. The smell clung to your hands.<br /><br />There was a thick grease on each piece. I've never had jerky that was so greasy.<br /><br />I am feeding the strips I didn't eat, that would be almost the whole bag, to my dog. She likes them and hasn't gotten sick, yet.<br /><br />I've never left a harsh review before but this product was so beyond bad I had to be brutally honest. I'm sure there are people who love this product but I am not one of them."
1,"This is the best jeky I've had. It's so good that I've setup an automatic shipment every two months. I ran into this product in Barstow, CA at a T/A stop. I decided to give it a try since the clerk stated that it was the best jerky she had ever tasted. She was right, it was excellent and made for a delicious snack enroute to Las Vegas. The jerky isn't hard, but not really soft either. Just a nice balance of texture. The heat comes on slow and takes a few pieces to really be felt, but the sweetness of the jerky is just right, so TASTY! Give this jerky a try, it's wonderful that these come in 1lb bags. Anything smaller and I think I would end up eating a bag a day."
1,"I gotta say..... I enjoyed this bag of jerky. I ordered the sweet and hot and it was just as good as any other beef jerky brand I have ever had. Was it greasy? Yeah, a bit. Not any more or less than others. It was moist and tender more than greasy. Did it have fat on it? Yeah. A few pieces, but honestly, those taste the best to me. I guess I like all kinds of beef jerky except for the dried out, harder than leather kinds. I don't mind having to chew, but I can't stand the type that is almost too hard to eat. This was not like that. It was moist, tender and juicy with some good flavor. I am getting it again. Might not be the best that is out there, but it is pretty good."
1,"wild ride jerky is very very good,and its a real deal,fast service and i will be back for more. i have not heard of it before but am a fan now"
1,"Best jerky I've had hands down. Better than Pemmican and Jack Links. Tender, flavorful and nice and thick. Excellent product, will keep on purchasing!"
1,"This is true jerky not the kind that looks stamped or processed. This being said because of the natural variances of beef some pieces are smaller or contain a trace of fat or may be grisly but this is not a common occurrence. I purchase 4 pkgs of this per month and have been for 8 months. In my opinion, this is the best out there for the price. Its consistent in quality and you get 16oz. I have tried all the flavors and my favorites are Hickory, Peppered and BBQ so this review will apply to these flavors."
1,I ordered the pepper one and sent it to my son in Afghanistan. He loved it. He doesn't ask for much when he's deployed but does love jerkey. I bought this because it came in a 1 lb package. He told me this was the best he's ever had and not to buy the Jack Link's any more. Must be really good for him to like it that well.
1,"Wow, when I bought this the first time I was impressed. For the price, it's a great tasting snack. It's a huge bag (about 4x the amount you'd get for the same price at the grocery store). It's fresh and well-made, not fatty. I highly recommend!"
1,This stuff is excellent.  I usually only buy Jack's Links so this was taking a risk and it was definitely worth it.  Especially considering the great price.  Highly recommended.
1,"This was the second time I ordered this product. I loved it the first time and for the two pieces I was able to get to before my dog did, I love it also. Very good!! I would recommend to anyone who like sweet and spicy flavors in one snack."
1,My four teenage boys wiped out the whole pound in one day. I heard no complaints. The few pieces that I tried had good flavor and not too dry. The peppered flavor was spicy as expected. I would order again and hide from the boys. Lol
1,"The sweet & hot has an excellent balance of spice, if you want something moderately hot but not extreme.  The jerky is ok, not great; it has a higher proportion of fatty pieces than most brands I've tried.  But it's an excellent value with good flavor, so I can't complain too much.  I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could."
1,taste great! i normally eat the point in the less than a week! i like the sweat and hot !
1,Seriously delicious. Not sure where the bad reviews are coming from but this stuff is one of the better tasting jerkys I have ever had. The balance of the spice and sweetness is spot on. It seemed rather fresh. This stuff is just plain good. My only complaint is that it wasn't in bigger pieces and that I wish it didn't have so many scrap/small pieces. Not enough to deduct stars because the taste is there.
1,"Tastes just like jerky should. The strips aren't too big or too small - and there isn't an absurd amount of pepper. A whole pound for TWELVE DOLLARS? you betcha. Priced right, unlike j*ck l*nks.. if you like simple, tasty beef jerky - this is for you."
1,I used to get this at a local major sporting goods store. They stopped carrying it. Thought it was gone forever until I decided to shop the web and here it was. I am a regular customer now getting it thru Amazon.
1,"I have to tell you.<br /><br />I'm a contractor working over-seas in Afghanistan. I have been doing this for over 2 years now, and we have stores called ""The PX"" where we can buy American goodies... right, the beef jerky. They have a huge selection of beef jerky but by the time it gets here 70% of the time its tough and no longer good. But we buy it anyway.<br /><br />I received a care package from a friend full of this ""Wild Ride beef jerky"" in it and let me tell you, It was soft, tasty delicious, not too salty, not to over flavored, and just plane old amazing! Now I'm addicted! My friends and I can now relax after a hard day of work open a bag and remember the green grass, the mountain air, and the lovely beaches of the old red, white and blue.<br /><br />Sounds to good to be true, but its amazing beef jerky.<br /><br />Thanks Wild Ride."
1,"The teriyaki jerky was very flavorful, not too sweet or salty; and pleasantly chewy too, as opposed to the dry/stringy stuff I've tried elsewhere. The price was reasonable. My main problem is that several bags went moldy within weeks. Several other buyers have the same complaint. The first time I thought it came that way and it slipped by me. I checked as the other bags arrived, and saw them quickly turn fuzzy. I realized I'd have to eat it all within a week or two or throw it out once it starts to go bad. It may be moot, since it's been discontinued as of March 2011. I don't mind the additives so much, but would  appreciate if (assuming they bring it back) the stuff could keep a bit longer."
1,"This stuff is great. It is not hard like a lot of the Jerky you would find on store shelves, and has a great taste.  I have ordered two bags so far. The first one me and my GF went through quick. The second one our dogs got to before we could finish it. They approve too!"
1,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:19 Mins<br /><br /></span>Wild Ride Beef Jerky Cowboy Strips, Pepper, 16-Ounce Bag<br /><br />Having a little fun today, did this review of the Wild Ride Jerky.<br /><br />After searching through lots of Jerky brands I found this to be one of the best around.<br /><br />ONE POUND bags are the way to go, my grocery store keeps putting less and less in larger bags.<br /><br />As with any beef Jerky it is really best to keep it sealed in your refrigerator.<br /><br />Funny to see how many reviews say jerky became moldy!  good jerky that is not over seasoned with preservatives will not last long in open air or heat....<br /><br />This is top quality US meat and seasoned lightly and marinated in a special formula to make it tender.<br /><br />I hope this is entertaining and helpful."
0,"I really like the wild ride jerky.  Very good bang for the buck, but this bbq is not good.  Would not recommend even trying it.  Tastes like dried up bbq sauce."
0,"The product was cheap, so I bought a pack to try. Wasn't the greatest beef jerky but not the worst for massed produced jerky.<br />Beef jerky is cut too thick for my liking, flavor wasn't really sweet or spicy."
0,I'm not picky at all when it comes to food but this beef jerky was some of the blandest jerky I've ever had. Not much flavor at all. I got the Teriyaki flavored. Maybe other flavors are better.
1,"This jerky was decent.  The softness of the pieces were in general pretty good, a little on the hard time sometimes but overall soft enough to chew comfortably.  They do vary a little bit within the bag so some pieces may be a bit too hard, but usually they don't get too soft.  The Sweet and Hot flavor tasted pretty good; so did the Teriyaki.  I'd recommend both!"
0,"Do not buy Wild Ride Beef Jerky. I purchased two bags of this jerky and they both ended up in the trash. I know Beef Jerky is supposed to be somewhat jerky but Wild Ride takes it to another level. Half the pieces are not edible. Maybe they should advertise this as bubble gum instead of jerky? The taste is OK, average at best. I think the only good thing about this product is the price. It is cheaper than most of the other brands out there. However, if price is what you're going for, go chew on some spare tires that are in the junkyard. What is sad is that rubber tires are probably more chewable than Wild Ridge Beef Jerky. Seriously, don't buy this brand."
1,"It is tender like the other guys have said, I like mine crunchy and harder, but it's not terrible.  For the price/product you get a pretty good deal considering how much jerky sells for at gas stations and stores.  I recommend it.<br /><br />Hickory:  I just tested this flavor out.  The original is much much better I think."
1,"One pound goes a long way.  The flavor is very addicting; like doritios or something.  you get a whole pound in the pack so it lasts a while.  It is dry and stringy but that is what I like.  The price is very economical.<br /><br />I recommend a smaller pack first, to make sure you like it.  Then if you do,  you can buy this bulk pack."
1,The price is great. The product is very good. I liked the barbeque flavor one the best so far. I don't know if everyone out there would like this type of jerky or not. But the pieces were soft and chewy and I liked it.
1,"perfect high protein, low fat snack.  very tender, so if you like to chew- this aint for you."
1,"the flavor is excellent.  Most of the pieces in each bag are nice and tender, however a few are pretty tough.  Overall an excellent value.  Price is less than half what my grocery store charges for beef jerky."
1,"Some of the best tasting jerky and at a terrific price!  You can't stop eating this jerky, it's soo good.  I have regular shipments coming to me and because of that I also get free shipping and another price discount.  Amazon and Wild Ride Beef Jerky paired together ... brilliant!"
1,"This is by far the best jerky available on Amazon.  All of the pieces are tender and thick.  No jerky crumbs, no itty bitty pieces.  All thick strips.  Very flavorful.  Even my wife who normally dislikes jerky can eat these.  I ordered the Spicy flavor.  It has a nice blend of spice and sweetness.  Nothing overpowering.  Thumbs up for any Jerky lovers out there.  Definately better than the common store-brands."
1,I used to buy Beef Jerky from the local store. But this is heaven woow that is it. Recomend this product to anyone.
1,"I receiced the order quickly of both the Hickory and the Sweet & Hot.  Have not opened the S&H yet but only the Hickory beef jerky.  The cut is very thick and meaty and not chewy at all.  I think it is too salty plus the fact that the packaging contains a large amount of crumbs (tiny bits of meats) as if they was loaded in the bag to make it one pound.  After mixing some grounded black pepper and sprinkled some sugar, the jerky tastes a lot better."
1,My whole family loves this jerky. It is tender and has a wonderful flavor. I am planning on keeping several bags on hand for last minute gifts.
1,"i ordered this on a whim because i love jerky, i love bbq, and Pounds of Jerky are usually around 20-25 bucks and I figured 2 bags of this brand of Jerky was a pretty sweet deal. I got barbecue and teriyaki.<br /><br />Taste is great, it was very fresh and flavorful, and the jerky was the perfect tenderness.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product. Well, the barbecue. Now the Teriyaki, that's another story. Very bland flavor, tasted like regular beef jerky that was thrown in some teriyaki sauce for a few minutes before packaging, definitely nowhere near the quality of the bbq. Same great tenderness though. I can't wait to try the other flavors. :D"
1,"These bags don't last long in our house.  Ordered 4 bags twice last month for my husband and son.  Best jerky, they love it.  Convienent to carry to work and school.  We will continue to purchase."
1,Wonderful jerky that is full of flavor and is not overly dry like the jerky you get at gas stations. I would recommend this to anyone who loves jerky.
1,I purchased this item out of curiosity......It's pretty good!  Chewy like jerky should be with delicious flavor.
1,"I like to say all of you that I got this item today and I really like the strip were thick and they weren't dry or hard.  I actually like the teriyaki flavor one the most, I also like the original. I really recommenced this product. If you like meat then you will like this.  I SAY BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT lol. I know I'm not an expert on food but i do like meat so this is just my opinion."
1,"This was not the best jerky I've had, but it was good, and was certainly worth the discounted price I got it for at Amazon (from my experience, under $1/oz is a good price).  The pieces were reasonably thick, flavorful, and most importantly, not too chewy.  I was not familiar with this brand until my recent purchase, but I'll definitely consider buying it again in the future."
1,I ordered this on a lightning deal so I got a great price. This jerky is tender and delicious. I believe it is one of the best I've had. The flavor is bold but not overpowering. It is mildly spicy and of course it's salty. I really enjoyed this product and plan to order it again. If you like jerky and are not worried about where the meat comes from or nitrates as other folks stated then you will probably love this stuff.
1,"True, it's not the healthiest beef jerky. But it's healthier than most kinds you buy in the store. It taste amazing, much better than Jack's Link's or whatever you find in the store. I bought the 4 bags for 13 dollars. And if it goes on sale again, I'll buy it again and again. However, if I get the hankiering for beef jerky again, this will certainly be the brand I'm after."
1,"This is great jerky! Tender, but still chewy and satisfying (not like shoe leather!); the slightly thicker slice on the meat is great. I really appreciate the salty/sweet taste of the Hickory marinade, with its nice hint of black pepper. I think they got it just right. There is enough spice to satisfy adult taste buds, and I don't think the heat will overwhelm older children, but for the little ones, the Teriyaki flavor is sweeter and less spicy. This is definitely a product the whole family will enjoy. Now, if they would just include a small packet of dental floss in each bag, it would be perfect!"
1,"Solid strips of flavorful beef, slightly tenderized with natural papaya enzymes, gives this jerky a nice bite without stressing out your jaw muscles. Pleasant natural smoke and pepper flavor doesn't overwhelm like so many other brands - the beef flavor comes through. Very low fat (0.5 g) and carb (1 g)per 1 oz serving make this jerky my South Beach Phase 2 snack of choice. Great for an on-the-go protein fix. BTW - 1 oz is a substantial portion to snack on!!!"
1,"This is the best Beef Jerky I've ever had. My son said the same thing when I asked him ""Where did the Beef Jerky go?"""
1,"I eat alot of Beef Jerky and Wild Ride Cowboy Strips Original is one of the best beef jerky products that I have ever had.  Great Price, Great Taste....  MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM"
0,"I guess there's no accounting for people's tastes. After reading the glowing reviews, I was ready for a taste treat. Not what I got.<br /><br />I've had many different jerkies, and made my own several times. In the old days, jerky was made to keep without refrigeration, and to have a handy food to carry along on the trail. Also to cover the taste of what was probably less than fresh beef.<br /><br />I like a spicy flavor, with just a little bite to it, sometimes a little sweet, sometimes with a teriyaki flavor.<br /><br />This product (at least the original flavor) is none of these things. It tastes like a piece of steak was partially cooked and partially dried with no added spices or flavors. Just a dull piece of meat. Gone also is the leathery texture of the jerky I'm used to. It is slightly chewy, but not the texture of real jerky that takes time to chew and allows you to enjoy it for awhile.<br /><br />So if that bland tasteless type of jerky is your cup of tea, this may be for you. It just doesn't ring my bell.<br /><br />Somewhat of a disappointing purchase."
1,"Wild Ride Cowboy strips are great.  The flavor is great and the taste fantastic without chemicals.  Far better than any other brand that I have ever eaten.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RBMADG"">Wild Ride Beef Jerky Cowboy Strips Teriyaki, 16 Ounce Bag</a>"
0,"This is the worst beef jerky I have ever had. It is uneatable. It is impossible to chew -- even my dogs gagged on it! Stick with quality U.S. products and not this cheap South American imported junk. The seller, Wild Bill, doesn't even put any contact information on the packaging to complain to. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RBGEOW"">Wild Ride Beef Jerky Cowboy Strips, Original, 16-Ounce Bag</a>. This product is a total waste of money."
0,"There's finely fuzzy white mold all over this stuff, and Amazon's return policy of food: You're SOL.  DISGUSTING!  Looks I've learned that grocery shopping on Amazon is not a particularly good idea.  Since I bought three different 1lb bags of this stuff in different flavors I'm out some cash.  Granted this one was the only one with mold, but the other two were complete inedible as they were made from cartilage scrap cuts - the stuff that either gets thrown away or fed to the pigs.  This flavor probably was, too, but since it has mold on it I'm not about to find out."
0,I love my jerky and this stuff is bad. I cant find anyone that will eat it.<br />Just gave it to my dog. I have never wrote a review before but just to on this stuff.
1,"I LOVE this beef jerky!  I am the Excutive Director for an organization called The Women's Wilderness Institute, Boulder, Colorado - we now have Wild Ride beef jerky on all our courses!<br />Our participants love the taste, texture...and it the perfect protein snack.  I like offering girls and women a low-carb, healthy option.<br />I recommend this to anyone with an active life-style and who likes to have a healthy snack and correct fueling for any outdoor activity."
0,"The description for the item is wrong.<br />It does contain MSG - Monosodium Glutamate.<br />It also contains preservatives.<br />This item should not be called ""All Natural"""
0,Upon receiving this product after my son had consumed some it was discovered that the bag was full of green mold!!  I wouldn't even give it one star but I had to if I wanted to be able to post this.
1,Loved the flavor and soft and chewyness of this Beef jerky. Spicey and great to every peice.<br />Not a bad price for where other jerky is more than $23 for barely 1lb and this one is steal with it
0,"I'm not a Jerky expert or anything like some of the reviews here. But I've had a few different brands, some the national brands and some smaller ones. I'd have to say this is a bit below average. It was slightly spicy but not terribly tasty and the texture wasn't that good. I didn't get the feeling I was eating quality meat.<br /><br />So why 1 star? Easy. Within 48 hours of opening it I was greeted with bluish white mold covering about 5 or 6 pieces. I'm sure by tomorrow it will be more but it's now in the trash. I don't even know how that happens"
0,"about 1 in 10 pieces actually taste like teriyaki and several pieces were VERY SPICY HOT. not tender and not a good value.<br />i got the 16 ounce bag for a little over 8 bucks so its fairly cheap but if the product is no good, getting a great price doesnt matter."
1,"This is really good stuff, they are a bit soft but I got a number of pieces that gave my jaw an exercise ;p The flavor cannot be beat! (sweet and hot). I also bought the bbq flavored one but I'll finish this one first :)"
0,The product seemed fresh on arrival but is sort of 'gummy' in texture. Didn't taste very good so I just threw it away.
0,"Absolutely horrible beef jerkey. It is really almost inedible. I threw most of this away. The taste is really off. The texture was way too soft. Almost fell apart in your mouth. I noticed that the ""beef"" did not come from USA per the package. Makes me wonder what kind of ""beef"" they are shipping in to dry. Is it old and rotten? Is it even beef? Sure doesn't tast like any beef jerkey I'm used to. Yuck."
0,I just got my order and it's (one of) the worst things I have ever put in my mouth! Something went horribly wrong when they made this batch. I think they spilled sodium nitrate or something all over this batch! It had white powder all over it and my even my dog turned his nose up at it! I give it one star because I've received two other orders that were so-so tasting but cancelled my subscription right after I got this... Buyer Beware!
0,The meat is really hard to chew on.  My teeth and jaw are now painful for just eating 3 pieces.  Teriyaki flavor is bland. It's not tasty at all.
0,"I got the hickory smoked version and it's packed with salt. I know jerky tends to have a high salt content, but this is the first time it has ever bothered me while eating it. It's usually an after effect like being thirsty. I really regret buying this and would much rather go back to Jack Link's X stick which are less nutritious and taste more like meat flavored than real meat.<br /><br />Salty taste aside, the pieces are thick and are of medium toughness (i.e., prepare to use some mouth muscles), which are good. Unfortunately, I sometime run into overly chewy pieces."
1,"I love my beef jerky and this is the style I like at a great price, especially if subscribed. At $11 for a pound shipped, how can anyone complain? Since preferences differ, I'd class myself as disliking the moist style beef jerky that have become popular in recent years, I would say this is similar jack links, a bit more dehydrated. My favorite used to be a bone dry japanese brand I cant seem to find anymore. It's not quite that dry, and they do tenderize it it in some manner. However, not over processed so you'll some across vein and fat as some reviewer complained of, but it give it a very natural texture. I give it 5 stars although its not perfect in consideration of the absolutely low cost as 4 1/2 isn't an option."
0,"Let me say this first:  our family of 6 keeps a high protein, low carb diet, and we eat a lot of jerky each month ( avg 30 lbs).  We have tried a vast majority of jerky out there, and can tell a good jerky from bad.  I have no idea how can anyone leave this jerky a positive, not to mention gleaming review.  Must be the first time trying jerky.  FIRST:  there is NOTHING natural about this jerky.  Few noticed, but their packaging used to say ""all natural"", but NO MORE, because they know it is not.  Now it says "" naturally hickory smoked"", or the like.  WHO CARES.  your jerky has so much cr_p in it that naturally smoking it makes no difference.  This jerky is full of salt.  this jerky is packed with MSG - and i mean PACKED!!!  This jerky is quite greasy. NOTE:  Bulk packaging ( 1 lb bags) are a bit better than smaller bags, and meat type in bulk bags is different.  YES&lt; this company has absolutely zero consistency.  If you take 20 chunks out of a bulk bag, you will see that there are 4-5 different kinds of meats there.  some wil be moist and chewy, others will be nothing but rubber, some with thick tendons running through, and some are quite marbled.  Just when you find a piece to your liking - you are back searching for a lucky chunk again.  smaller bags, especially teriyaki is very greasy and has so much coating that you taste all the chemicals way before you get to meat flavor ( if you can call it that).<br /><br />i'd give this jerky a 2 if there was meat consistency, but its a total crap shoot.  you can find LOTS of other - better tasting jerky in the same price range, here on amazon.  even the middle of the road obertos is much better than this stuff.  WILD RIDE JERKY IS A JOKE and IS GROSS.  Buy at your own risk, but know that you are buying a truly chemically processed and preserved jerky - full of MSG and 0ther additives.<br /><br />OH, and those 1 lb cowboy stips bags?  Well,  there was exactly 10 oz of strips in a bag - rest was jerky shavings and bitsNpieces - similar to what oberto sells as bulk packages salad topper shavings of jerky - NO STRIPS!!!  we tried every flavor in their bulk=-packaged variety and this holds true for every single package."
0,"I did not like the taste or texture of Wild Ride Original but decided to give the company one more chance as this flavor was on sale.  While the flavor is better, unfortunately the meat is of such poor quality that it's difficult to recommend.  I uploaded three images as examples of what you will find in a typical bag.  You'll see that about 10-15% of the pieces are marbled in a high amount of fat which is odd because meat was originally smoked not only to add flavor but to get rid of fat so it would last longer.  I'm not sure what's happening here.  Some pieces have hardened grease settling on them, most likely due to the meat being smoked on something similar to a conveyor belt as opposed to hanging in a smoker.  Finally, the pieces that don't have any apparent fat or grease may still contain gristle as another reviewer mentioned.  It's not horrible, but it is of low quality to match its low price.  I wouldn't recommend it to any serious jerky lovers but you can check the at the top of the page and decide for yourself."
0,"I bought two bags (original) which were delivered to me on November 16th...<br /><br />The first bag was good. It had soft pieces of jerky mixed with annoying hard pieces of jerky. The meat has a nice fat to meat ratio, you know when you bite down on a fatty piece of meat. However, the hard pieces had tendon or sinew. On some pieces I could pull the silver sinew out and use it to floss my teeth. Not palatable at all. Generally the jerky is somewhat grainy due to the spices but is palatable. A strong peppery taste permeated the jerky. I felt like some of the pieces were not mixed properly, some pieces of meat were more salty than others.<br /><br />The taste is quite enjoyable. (I'm known to eat anything... & can acquire taste) If you don't mind fishing out the bad parts...<br /><br />However, my second bag developed some kind of mold. I started on the second bag without knowing that this bag contained a mold ball right in the middle of the bag. About half way through I found the moldy meat. I had read of this occurring in some people's product but I dismissed it as a freak chance.<br /><br />The mold is white, it reminds me of bread fluff. The mold is very bitter. I just reached into the bag for a piece of jerky & bit down on a moldy piece. I promptly spat it out and saw the middle part of the bag was fully rotten. IMHO.<br /><br />Would I buy this product again?<br /><br />No. a 50% chance of getting moldy meat... Well I don't wanna chance it."
0,"It gets one star for the price, fat and salt content and because it's 3.65 oz. rather than the 4 oz. in brands available in local groceries.  The pieces were thick and flat, which is more attractive than the wrinkly stuff.  But the fat content is 13% compared to a more typical 2% and delivers 35 fat calories per 1 oz serving compared to a typical 5 calories from fat in a 1 oz. serving from the three different brands our local Kroger Grocery carries.  All that fat didn't make it more tender or less chewy.  And that fat is displacing protein in a 1 oz serving, so 1 0z. delivers 90 calories instead of 70.  And there was 520 mg salt compared to 470 from the store brands.<br /><br />Unless this just hits your palate in some incredible way, can't understand why anyone would buy this product."
1,"This product is really fine!<br />I shared my 2 oz. bar with a friend and wished there was more when it was all gone!<br />The chocolate is intense and not cloyingly sweet...it has a high cacao content...it's the kind of chocolate that's good for you!<br />The nibs add a rice Krispy-like crunch, and a depth of chocolate flavor.<br /><br />NOT FOR THE SWEET TOOTH, but if you are a dedicated fan of fine, dark chocolate, this bar is for you!<br />NOTE: it comes with a date stamp, and the president of the company advised me when I wrote, that it is not a use-by or sell-by stamp---THIS IS A DATE OF MANUFACTURE STAMP! And sure enough, my bar was fresh and delicious."
0,"The previous reviewer was quite right. When the price dropped to $7.49 & free shipping I figured it had to be worth it; it is not.<br />There is NO cheese included and NO wine included. It does include .40 oz of dip mix, 2 4 oz packages of triangular shaped ""flatbread"" crackers (flat also describes the taste) for dipping or with cheese & wine you must buy elsewhere and 12 oz of ""frappe vino"" mix which you add to your wine & freeze. Even one star is too much for this item."
0,I may have purchased the product if there had been more of a description<br />ie: what kind of cheese? What kind and how much wine etc.
1,"I am very into health and will research every product I consume until I am certain it's worthy.  I've tried 3 different organic matchas in the past and this is, by far, the best.<br /><br />This is a vibrant green color (very pretty color - especially when made)This is proof that young leaves were chosen and dried properly.  The brighter, the better.  Some matchas are dull green (dirty pea green color) - these are more of a food grade matcha (for baking, ice creams, etc.).  Food grade matchas have a dull taste as well. Ceremonial (drinking) tea should always be vibrant.  This is an excellent drinking tea.<br /><br />The packaging is the best I've seen.  Not only does it come in a sealed pop/top can, but once opened you will find your tea inside a sealed foiled bag. Impressive. A bit of a mess to empty the contents back into the can, but it makes for a very fresh tea.<br /><br />The taste of this tea is the cleanest I've tasty. Not at all bitter as some I've had. This is definitely the only matcha I will be ordering.<br /><br />From my research and own experience. I highly recommend keeping your matcha in the fridge to keep fresh."
1,"Having tried two different matcha powders thus far from Amazon.com, I am extremely impressed by the quality of DoMatcha's product. The other product I had ordered from Tao of Tea, while cheaper and 3 times the size and also of Japanese origin, simply does not compare to the fresh appearance and taste of DoMatcha's product. Exceptionally vibrant green color out of the box that turns into an extremely lush, dark forest green color upon addition of water, with an exceptionally fresh taste to match. If the matcha powder Starbuck's uses is taken as a token standard of like 100, Tao of Tea's matcha would be 80 or 90, while DoMatcha would be at least 125. The former two have colors of dull green and greenish-yellow respectively after water is mixed in with the matcha.<br /><br />I have not tried the really high-quality, really expensive premium matcha with elegant Japanese names and calligraphy on the cases they come in. But I am willing to bet that DoMatcha can quite hold its own against the super-premium labels/brands of matcha out there."
1,"This matcha is simply wonderful!<br /><br />Bright green color and excellent taste. I have been using this matcha for over 6 months now and while it is a little more expensive than most, it is the best that I have tried. The best thing is that it is the best way to get your green tea and is extremely healthy for you. Give DoMatcha a try, I think you will love it too!<br /><br />Don't forget to get a Chasen (bamboo whisk), Chashaku (bamboo scoop) and a Chawan (matcha bowl) to complete the experience."
1,"I have now tried several different Matcha's. THIS IS THE BEST OF THE BEST<br /><br />I am very sensitive to substances that go into my body. Do your research. I did.<br /><br />I drink Green Tea for the health benefits. I am 61 years old now. My metabolism has slowed. My brain never tolerated caffeine very well. And, I do not want or like to be physically addicted to any drug (caffeine). When I was in Iraq, I drank caffeinate concentrated coffee (1 can of triple shot) per day. When I missed a day or two, my body went into a sluggish withdrawal with headache/stuffy brain. That was awful.<br /><br />I read about this Do Matcha Green Tea and how the other substances (Catechins, etc.) in it were so healthful and that the caffeine was low. I tried it and found there were no withdrawal symptoms after drinking one cup every day for a week. To my surprise it was just as uplifting as the Triple Shot had been, but with less than a third of the caffeine. It also had a very calming effect and produced a mental clarity I enjoyed in my 20's and 30's.<br /><br />The other Matcha's I tried because of cheaper price failed to produce the mental clarity. Mental clarity is what I missed the most in getting older. Only Do Matcha first harvest (Ceremonial Grade) has produced this. Read up on this so that I do not have to write so much to impart knowledge to those who do not know.<br /><br />I do not drink this for the taste. I drink it for the health benefits. The others DO NOT measure up to Do Matcha!!!<br /><br />You get what you pay for. Many extoll the different mixes they use Green Tea for. That is not me. I drink it straight with cool water. I don't want to lose any of the nutrition because of heated water. I use a battery operated frother to mix it. I like the veggie taste (like raw spinach). It is a quick drink that uplifts, enlivens, and clarifies. If you need to enhance your life. Pay for this. Yes, it is expensive... and worth the extra cost if you value your health.<br /><br />My body has become more supple. No more morning stiffness. No more morning grogginess. No more sore feet when getting out of bed. I have been using Do Matcha (and tried others) for 7 months now. I can quit without any signs of withdrawal. But, the age factors set in again.<br /><br />So, one cup a day of Do Matcha seems to be quite therapeutic for me."
1,"This green tea is not brewed and then the leaves thrown out. You drink the whole leaf crushed into a powder getting all the phytonutrients and benefits that tea bags cannot give you. It becomes a superfood when you get it this way. Check out the website domatcha.com for more information but get the product here because it is cheaper. For even more info on the health benefits of this type of tea go to mercola.com then do a search in Products for Royal Matcha. This one though, is even more expensive and not any better than Do Matcha that I can tell after doing alot of research.<br /><br />I drink this every day and it makes me more alert and sharp of mind without the crash of caffeine and stimulants. It does not taste like much, it has a very mild 'spinachy' taste, but I don't drink it because it tastes so good, I drink it for mental clarity, emotional support and for my health and immune support. I don't put it in hot water. I put it in about 24 ounces of room temperature water and agitate it with an egg whisk to blend it with the water, otherwise it clumps, hot or cold. They try to sell you a wooden whisk but I use the metal one that I already had and it works great. Just agitate it really good by rolling the handle back and forth in your hands in the drink very quickly until it is foamy and well blended and drink right away."
1,"I'm not a health nut by any means, yet I have often enjoyed a nice hot cup of green tea when I'm at my favorite sushi bar.  However, when I'd tried my hand at making green tea with packets, I could never come close to replicating the flavor and texture of the tea that I'd grown accustomed to at said sushi bar.  I'd even tried the $3 cup of green tea at Starbucks and it was a bitter experience for me.<br /><br />On a whim I decided to search out a better green tea experience and I found this gem here on Amazon.  The tin that the tea comes in was sealed securely.  Upon opening the tin, inside there was a sealed bag that I opened and poured into the tin carefully.  The arouma of the tea before brewing is pleasant to say the least - it has a fresh and mild scent that is not overbearing.  Brewing the tea was as simple as adding a small amount (about half a teaspoon) to a cup of warm to hot water.  I would not recommend boiling water as I did try that once and the tea clumped up at the bottom of the cup.<br /><br />This green tea looks and tastes wonderful.  I don't like adding sugar or sweeteners to my tea so it was an all natural taste.  It's got a smooth flavor and is not at all bitter like many other brands I've tried.  It tastes just as good as the green tea from the sushi bar and I'm more than pleased with it.  As a side note, I notice that some reviews recommend using ceremonial tools to enhance the experience.  I may try those tools in the future, but for now I am happy with the results of my rudimentary method for brewing.<br /><br />One tip - remember that less is sometimes more.  This small tin can last awhile if you ration the amount of tea you use per serving.  Use too much and you may experience clumping at the bottom.  Happy drinking!"
1,"I would give it six or seven stars here if they allowed it.  You get what you pay for, my friends, and this is the MOST HEAVENLY thing on earth to drink--tastewise and healthwise.  However, I will tell you that we use 1/2 Teaspoon in a 1 pint bottle of Lipton ICED green tea.  See my review of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM6PS0"">Lipton Green Tea, Mandarin Orange, Premium Pyramid Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> for the recipe.  I make a pot every morning and have completely replaced the morning coffee ritual with green tea.  It gives you the right lift and does not let you down at 11 am.  We still have 3 pm <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H6UX0Y"">Senseo Douwe Egberts Colombia Blend Coffee Pods, 16-Count Packages (Pack of 4)</a> on days when we exercise, but we've broken our addiction to coffee with cream now.<br /><br />It has the most EGCG and mixed catacholamine antioxidants of any green tea product you can imagine.  There is a small insert with the packaging that details the contents for you and also contains the recipe for a Green Tea Frappachino that looks just great.<br /><br />We tried to ""do it on the cheap"" with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BVNSFW"">Vita Life Matcha (Green Tea Powder) - 10.58 Oz Twin Pack - 2x10.58 Oz</a> but it has an aftertaste that I don't really like.  The Do Matcha is the real article, and it's organic as well.  It's so concentrated that it's actually economical.  You will save $4.00 every time you make your own Starbuck's Green Tea Frappachino.  If you want to know what this tastes like go try one of those which are fantastic but contain a lot of calories and fat:  our iced tea with Do Match is much healthier and every bit as delicious."
1,"This is by far the best matcha I've tried, and probably the best matcha available at this price. Not only is the flavor great (some more oxidized matchas can taste slightly seaweed or hay like) but it is very fine grained - no grit at all."
1,"For the vast majority of people, a functionally identical product is the non-organic version, which saves a large part of this rather premium price:  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019FR0F8"">DoMatcha Green Tea, Matcha, 1.06-Ounce Tin</a>.<br /><br />Though this is some of the best Matcha available (especially for Amazon Prime junkies like me), IMHO the premium that the organic certification adds is too large.  I am sure the administrative overhead and more expensive processes genuinely account for most of the markup, but DoMatcha seems to take great care to ensure that their regular products are never contaminated.  Additionally, considering the relatively small quantity of material you are actually ingesting, even pesticide-drenched, badly washed leaves would carry less poison in a dozen tins than a single non-organic potato sometimes does!<br /><br />For those who buy organic for moral reasons, drinkers who have special health requirements relative to farming processes, and the lucky few with an excess of cash---this is the best Matcha I have found on Amazon.  Otherwise, get the cheaper equivalent.  Either way, you'll love it!"
1,"I never knew about Matcha Green Tea, this weekend while I was at our local Whole Foods, a lady approached me asking if I would like to try some tea and to have a demonstration. She made me a cup with a special whisk which creates a beatiful froth. I have never been a fan of the tast of green tea (I like the Rishi loose leave tea with the Jasmine) due to the stinky smell and ususually have to have it in some blend.  However, this one had more of a wheat grass smell and taste to it.  I didn't buy it initially and went back today to buy it - I googled it and found it on amazon for $7.00 less and am ordering more along with the whisk.  I tried using a regular one but after watching her prepare it - it wasn't the same and it didn't have that same frothy taste.  I'm curious for the regular Matcha drinkers how many glasses they make a day or if just one.  She also said I could add it to my protein shakes as well in the morning if I didn't like the taste and it would give me the same health benefits.  Love it."
1,As the previous reviewers have stated this is the best matcha I have ever used.  It is bright green and wonderful.  You really do get what you pay for.
1,"I compared 4 different brands of matcha green teas. Here's how they rate:<br /><br />#1 DO 2nd Harvest, excellent flavor, texture, and color, expensive, organic<br /><br />#2 Serendipi, great flavor, best price for the quality, organic<br /><br />#3 The Tao of Tea, local Portland Oregon company, fair flavor, price slightly lower than DO, organic<br /><br />#4 Maeda-en, available at Uwajimaya. Difficult to dissolve. Less favorable flavor and not organic<br /><br />Uwajimaya has best selection of Matcha teas with several others I have not tried yet. Whole Foods carries both DO and Tao of Tea. New Seasons currently does not carry Matcha. Serendipi is available on Amazon for $17/4 oz. box, best tea for your money!"
1,"It is very good matcha tea, no doubt about that. But I've found very comparable matcha for one tenth the price.  Your have to search a bit -- try search on ""iMatcha Green Tea Powder"".  If you found it you'll know -- 1LB of it is equal in price to 2 OZ of this, or a little less.  Like I said - one tenth the price.<br /><br />If you really believe you have to pay large money to get quality matcha, then you might want to re-assess your belief system, to see if it is really helping you or not."
1,Not much to say here except that this is superb matcha. Excellent flavor and color. I drink it nearly everyday and it makes me feel great.
1,"Prefer this over the other DoMatcha teas due to it's milder taste; not as vegetative or astringent. And of course, Amazon has the best price I've found for this grade of matcha."
1,"This is the best brand, so I bought it.  It payed off big time.  This is the golden standard of brands of matcha to try.  All others can bow down to this one.  I would say that when I drank it, my whole world seem to align and I was able to focus and not to mention the flavors of this matcha are intense.  Not for the average tea drinker!"
0,"There's no question this product is very high quality, it's just I prefer a smoother tasting, less tangy Matcha. It's not for me, but you might enjoy it. I liked the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019FR0WQ"">DoMatcha 2nd Harvest  Matcha Green Tea, 2.82-Ounce Tin</a> better."
1,"The flavor isn't as complex as others I've had, but it is pleasing and more than adequate. The color is a nice deep ""matcha green"". The aroma and taste of the dry powder are good. It whisks into an even, fine foam. I recommend it."
1,"This was the first time I had ever tried Matcha Tea. I read the reviews and thought it sounded great. I decided to pay the high price for this tea because of the reviews it got. I was absolutely shocked when I received the tea, however. It comes in a tiny tin. Inside the tiny tin is a tiny foil pouch. Inside the tiny foil pouch is a silicone packet to keep the tea dry. There was a lot of tea ""stuck"" to this little packet. So basically you get about two tablespoons of tea, if that, for well over $20. To me it looked like a ""sample"" product that would be worth a couple of dollars.<br /><br />Yes, the tea is a lovely shade of green. I made my own recipe of chai spices with ginger, cloves and cinnamon. I added frothed, unsweetened almond milk. It was good, but not good enough to justify paying that much. Fortunately I am never dissatisfied with Amazon.com because, as always, they offer immediate refunds for products that don't live up to their standards of customer satisfaction.<br /><br />I'm going to try another organic green tea that is highly rated next time. I probably won't be able to tell any difference. I'm sure this product is good tea. The question is whether or not it's so much better than the other highly-rated green teas that it is worth close to $24 for a couple of cups. For me it is not. This is yet another experience with Amazon that proves I can't go wrong buying through them. Thanks, Amazon, for truly making shopping a risk-free adventure.<br /><br />I am now editing my original review and I have changed the rating from 2 to 4 stars. There is no other matcha tea like this one. It gives me energy. It tastes great. The kind of energy it gives me is a sense of calm, well-being, and energy without any jittery feeling. It lasts many hours, but I don't ""crash."" I like it, and it's worth the extra money. I will be ordering it again."
1,Matcha tea is wonderful. The seller was prompt. Their are so many health benefits to Matcha - I am turning all my family into Matcha tea lovers.
1,"I had tried some matcha prior from Red Leaf Tea (admittedly their mid grade matcha of which they have 3) and I did enjoy it but found that the experience was not worth the premium I paid.<br /><br />I again am overwhelmed at the cost. I'm sure I could buy quality illegal substances on the street for cheaper. If like the more vehement proponents claim it is the cure for depression, cancer, heart disease, human suffering and Donald Trump it might be worth it, but scientifically it seems to be only the more basic claims have been substantiated. That's enough for me to work my way into the matcha world, but there is that retirement I've been eyeing.<br /><br />That having been said I will say that the increase in price is certainly in line with the increase I have tasted in quality. I am very happy with this DoMatcha matcha. The color is almost neon green, it bubbles up quite a bit and has a mellow but full sweet/grassy vegetal taste. It's fairly strong but mild and smooth if that makes sense.<br /><br />All in all very impressive but since I plan to drink about 5 cups of green tea a day that would run me hundreds per month, so I'll have to find a sweet spot between quality and price and I'm not sure this is it.<br /><br />If you want a treat I would get this or the highest quality ipoddo (which seems to come much higher recommended), but for a daily drinking tea I might recommend Red Leaf's caramel matcha lowest grade."
1,"The first time I ever tried Matcha, it was almost a brownish-green color, which I eventually learned, is not a premium grade.  This DoMatcha was nearly 4x the price (ounce vs. ounce), but the quality is clearly way, way better.  Not only that, this DoMatcha tea gives me great energy, without any jitters or feeling spacey, like the other one made me feel.<br /><br />I have always been a big Starbucks Green Tea Latte kind of guy.  I love those things to death.  BUT, the Vente would cost me $4.30 every day.  Even with the very high price tag of this DoMatcha, I can duplicate the same formula for almost 1/4 the price, and I can also use a sweetener of my choice, which is Xylitol.  I can keep it low glycemic, organic, and sugar free, and pay a fraction of the Starbucks price.  It's great.<br /><br />My only beef with the DoMatcha is the packaging.  The tin is great, but the tea itself comes in a sealed silver pouch inside, which is VERY messy.  I eventually dumped the tea out of the pouch into the tin, but I probably lost 1/2 to 1 full serving in the process.  Powder was flying everywhere.  Perhaps I'll get better at the exchange in time, but that was the ONLY bad thing I have to say about this premium Matcha formula.<br /><br />I'll definitely be buying again, but perhaps the 2nd Harvest one the next time, since it's about 1/2 the price, but still remains organic."
1,"Of the Matcha I have tried, this has the best taste by far--bright and fresh, not ""fishy"" or grass clipping flavored like cheaper stale matcha one often finds for sale.  It may seem like a small amount for one's money but one only needs a teaspoon per cup, and it's health benefits are akin to about 6 cups of regular bag-green tea.  I think it's an investment, and also, since it is organic, there is going to be no pesticide residue to worry about."
1,This is my first time trying matcha and I was unsure how I would like it. I was plesantly surprise with this. I purchased this brand because of all the the great reviews and I am glad I did.
1,"This is easily my favorite matcha that I have ever purchased for home use.  It is an incredibly bright and vibrant green and tastes divine.  For the price I do not think you could beat the quality.  I have tried about five other brands, most of which more expensive, and have no been happier than with this product."
1,"I make the matcha by boiling hot water and adding honey. It delicious! It's a great, healthy drink to have. It really is bright green so expect many people to pester you with questions!"
1,"The only reason I give this product a 4 star rating instead of a 5 is that the caffeine level in this tea is very high.  I read a previous review on Amazon that said it was better than coffee because it had only a mild ""kick"" from caffeine, however, my experience was different.  I get a jolt about an hour after I drink it and it's uncomfortable for a little while, then it's okay.  I love the flavor because it's so rich and earthy (which deserves 5 stars).  I do highly recommend this product if you can handle the caffeine."
1,"OMG!!!  This Matcha is absolutely wonderful!  It has a smooth taste that is not in a least bit bitter!  It's also a beautiful bright green color.  I have bought other cheaper brands before and they didn't compare.  They were bitter and virtually impossible to drink.  I won't be buying it again though because it's so rediculously expensive. Just wanted to try real quality matcha, and this was it!"
1,I love this Matcha powder. I do not have anything to compare it too but it is organic and makes delicious tea. It can also be used in cooking.
1,"I love this tea....the flavor is very nice.  The container is very small, but a little of this tea goes a long way; I drink it hot with milk and honey ~ very nice!"
1,Love this tea -  Quality seems really good for the price!  Will order again when mine runs out (which will be soon)  lol
1,"This was the first time I ordered this product. Everything went smoothly, and the tea is great.  I would purchase again."
1,"This was my first purchase of matcha green tea. I have always been a big green tea fan and I heard about the health benefits of matcha so I decided to try it. The benefits are definitely there, as you are ingesting the whole tea leaf.<br /><br />This stuff is pretty cool, brightly colored green like nothing you have ever seen before. But, to be honest the taste is nothing special. Maybe I'm making it wrong but I don't know where these other reviewers are coming from. I'll keep trying different methods in an attempt to make this stuff taste better.<br /><br />Regardless I can say this stuff is better than coffee for a boost in energy. And I love coffee. Does not have the negatives associated with coffee, such as jitters, or crashing, but instead you feel alert and attentive all day.<br /><br />I had hartley green tea bags(sancha I think) and I liked the taste of that much better."
1,"This tea yields a good tasting cup of green tea, IMO.  I try to drink a few cups of green tea daily for its health benefits, and because the price of this product makes that an expensive undertaking, I don't rely on this product exclusively.  Nevertheless, I do like it and will continue to buy it, especially when it's on sale!"
1,I found this to be  wonderful matcha. It has a bright green color and a very smooth taste. It is not bitter at all and whips into a nice green froth easily. I would highly recommend it. Amazon also has another matcha (Teazone) that I buy for lattes and the like but it's not nearly as tasty ( much cheaper though).
1,"Pros:<br />Great color (meaning high quality)<br />Mild taste<br />Sealed packaging<br /><br />Cons:<br />Price<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this tea. I have made it a few different ways, including my own ""Latte"" style matcha where I use milk and froth. I really have enjoyed the taste, as it is non-bitter and smooth."
1,"I drink only the best tea. There is a huge difference between tea bags and premium quality teas.<br /><br />I had yet, however, tried the Matcha tea. Being the tea-snob that I am, I decided to get the best one for my first try.<br /><br />The very first try was a disappointment. Its taste, much to my surprise, was substantially different from tea-leaf green teas. It actually had LESS taste than the premium leaf green teas. It also didn't have the same ""kick"" I get with preimium leaf green teas. Thinking I didn't put enough tea into my cup, so I decided to put little more.<br /><br />Then I tried to sleep and I couldn't.<br /><br />The caffeine rush in this tea is VERY subtle yet powerful. You will hardly feel it. You will feel like you are driving a Mercedes on a straight line going 100mph. You know you are going fast, but just won't feel it.<br /><br />The 2nd try, I was hooked. I realized it had only one taste: Umami. Umami is called the ""5th taste"" that has been scientifically validated as the 5th taste our taste buds are capable of detecting. Unlike sweetness and saltiness, Umami is subtle.<br /><br />If you have never tried Matcha tea, I highly recommend this tea. The only reason I won't give it 5 stars is because I have yet to try other Matchas and I have no idea if this one is actually better than the ones that cost half its price."
1,"I LOVE THIS BRAND OF JAPANESE MATCHA. I HAVE TRIED OTHERS BUT THIS ONE STANDS OUT TO ME AS ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE BOUGHT SO FAR. IT IS PRICEY BUT YOU WILL GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR IN THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT. IT IS BRIGHT GREEN, VERY FRESH AND THE AROMA IS VERY EARTHY, ACROSS BETWEEN ALFALFA AND FRESH CUT GRASS. IT IS A VERY HEALTHY PRODUCT WITH A VAST ABUNDANCE OF ANTOXIDANT AND OTHER HEALTH BENEFITS. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
1,"This tea is very delicious! The only problem is the price... Not really a good alternative for a coffee addict, there is simply not enough caffeine. But overall, I would recommend it for anyone to try at least once!"
1,"Pound for pound highest antioxidants vs any food, also noticed increases energy level during my work outs. I can run, swim, bike, longer, faster, and harder than if I do not drink this matcha tea. Not only do you physically feel stronger, mentally as well.<br /><br />Orgasms are much stronger and last longer, I am an athlete and my body is sensitive to what I eat, this matcha tea is phenomenal, why do you think the japanese have such healthy sexual appetites?! Got to be the food and tea they are drinking! This tea is expensive, but it gets 5 stars because it is worth every penny."
0,"This is a great product but it is item is way overpriced here.  The can is much, much smaller than it appears in the photo.  I thought for sure that they had made a mistake when I opened the box.  This can is less than half the size of what they sell at my local health food store.  This is a very, very, small can.  It is only 1.06 ounces.<br /><br />At my local health food store, normally very expensive as it is a small store, they charge only $1 more for a 2.82 oz can.<br /><br />ALSO, YOU CAN NOT RETURN THIS ITEM.  THEY MUST KNOW THEY ARE RIPPING YOU OFF SO THEY MAKE IT A DO NOT RETURN ITEM.<br /><br />SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T BE RIPPED OFF."
1,"The flexibility and reliability these ballasts offer is well worth it, working with either High Pressure Sodium (HPS) or Metal Halide (MH) and they don't cost too much.  They run cool and make very little noise.  While they don't have the dimming capability of others, they do run on 120, 208 or 240v, and are generator friendly.  600w are actually the most efficient HPS, beating 400 and even 1000w bulbs!"
1,"This is by far the BEST and MOST REAL honey I have ever come across with in my lifetime. It is also one of the better tasting honeys in its category. It is indeed 100% natural raw honey, which is obviously never heated, filtered or strained; hence preserving all the natural vitamins, minerals, enzymes and antioxidants found in honey. The fact that the producers decided to add pollen, propolis, and crushed honeycomb to the jar is also brilliant. Eat two table spoons of this honey everyday, I swear your life span will go up by several years. This honey is simply incredible, what a great gift from mother nature!<br /><br />The jars are also very cute. At the cost of a very reasonable shipping price, I have received my first two jars within 36 hours in perfect shape after my order. Thanks for the super fast shipping Wee-Bee.<br /><br />Don't waste this honey by spreading it on your toast or in your tea. Eat it up all by itself from the jar whenever you feel like it. This is beyond your standard honey, which is totally spoiled by heating and filtering -thanks to the profit oriented industrialists in the honey business. Wee-Bee honey is the real deal, and it is very reasonably priced. What a piece of heaven! I can't wait to order more. Thank you Wee Bee!"
1,"I haven't ordered this product from Amazon, but I buy it at my local health food store. Fortunately, there is ONE store of all the health food stores in my area that carries this brand. As the previous customer commented, WeeBee honey is the REAL DEAL! It is the best tasting honey I've ever experienced in my life, to ditto the other reviewer!! Lets put it this way, I and my daughter keep the health food store in business!!!  Although I never ordered directly from the WeeBee company, since I can get it locally, I have dealt with them via E-Mail. I had questions when I made my first purchase and I can honestly tell you they are the friendliest and most knowledgeable people there are in the honey business! A+++ for WeeBee Honey and their company!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"This is the best raw honey. I won't repeat what the other two reviewers said, because they summed it up perfectly! But, I will tell you that you can actually taste flowers (as orange blossom honey has a citrus flavor, this has a floral taste). It's heavenly. I've been using it as ""cough medicine"" since I caught my son's cold and I've never used anything more effective. I will continue to eat a couple of tablespoons of this a day to get all of the minerals, antioxidants, etc. It really is the BEST raw honey I've ever purchased, and I'm shocked I bought it from a health food store and not a local farmer's market! You will NOT be disappointed!!"
1,Wow what a great concept on these products.  I can see me taking these products on the run!  what a great way to make sure you stay healthy:) I like the pkg size it so easy to take.  I am going to review all of these products.  I just loves the concept !
1,"This is my favorite gluten-free pasta.  I cook it exactly as the directions tell you to and I rinse it with warm water very well before serving.  It does have a slightly different flavor/texture than regular wheat pasta but if you have allergies, you can't compare everything to what you use to eat.  Rarely do I ever find anything that compares to what I ate before, but after you eat this a time or two, you will think you have been eating it all along.  My husband eats gluten/wheat and over time I stopped buying different noodles for each of us and our family eats these.  If you have children, I doubt they would even notice a difference.  These are great to have around if you are pressed for time and need a fast gluten-free meal.  I have had other pasta products from De Boles and I will admit that the other types of noodles (lasanga, penne) do not taste as good but I still use them.  You can tell they are not wheat noodles."
1,"My 3-year-old with celiac loves this pasta.  It tastes as good as wheat pasta once the sauce is on it.  I love it because it cooks fast,"
0,"My husband has gluten sensitivity, so we've tried several gluten-free pastas.  This one does not hold together, even with the minimum cook time, and it turns into smaller bits, making my pot of spaghetti runny and not noodly enough.  I won't buy it again."
0,"I tried this spaghetti with the hopes that it would in some way resemble the wheat pasta I used to love to eat, but it doesn't even come close.  The taste is ricey and bland, and it falls apart despite following the cooking directions.  There are many good wf/gf pasta products out there these days, but this isn't one of them."
1,"This is by far the best GF & corn free pasta out there!! I served it to my whole family and they didn't even notice!  The only down side that I have found is that after it cools...it gets really hard.  So serve it fresh and don't bother to keep the leftovers!<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />I have found that if you pour the spaghetti sauce over the noodles for storage, it keeps much better."
1,If I could eat gluten containing pasta I would not eat this product. But I can not eat wheat or gluten. This is the best gluten free pasta I have found. It is good as regular spaghetti with a sauce. We also use it in stir fries. Good in both. But not as good as wheat pasta.
0,"This pasta is NOT good - not for Italian dishes, at least, although it might be okay for Asian noodle dishes.  Besides the taste, it also goes gummy and sticky really easily.  Try Tinkyada's brown rice pastas instead - Tinkyada tastes almost the same as regular pasta, and cooks up firm.  You don't have to settle for strange tasting pasta just because you can't eat gluten!"
1,My family will eat it. I have Celiac and am allergic to wheat. These taste great. Thats why I bought the case here.
1,I like this pasta because its a great alternative to wheat pasta that I cant eat due to food allergies. I make different dishes with it and like its versatility.
1,"DeBoles Spaghetti turns out perfectly, pot after pot. The trick is bringing the water (with a little olive oil in it) to a rolling boil, before adding the pasta. Then boil for ten minutes, remove immediately, and drain. The pasta is al dente and never sticky, hard, or mushy. I will continue to buy this pasta. It is much better than NRG and other brands."
1,"I love this extract so much that after I purchased an 8oz bottle of it, next time I ordered a 16oz bottle because I went through the 8 ounces so fast!  Need I say more?"
1,"This is like berry wine; very intense just slightly sweet flavor very reminiscent of a good dark wine, or a port. My use will be maximized by using it in my kombucha brew: maximizing the anti-oxidant potential and making a little bit go a long way. I would highly advise doing this, you can just combine an oz with other fruits in a smoothie or juice. If you can really stretch out the volume it somewhat justifies the cost. Maqui berries have yet to be fully analyzed on the ORAC scale but they are widely known to be higher than acai which ranks just over 100K, with only a dozen or so above it. Bottom line if you can make this bottle last for several months at least by combining it with other drinks you'll find it's well worth it."
1,These Crepe Belgian Chocolate Biscuits are quite simply put the BEST! They are very light and airy. The biscuit is very thin and covered in the milk chocolate.  They are addicting so get ready to want more. I first bought them last year at Christmas.  They are now a tradition at my house.
0,"The box says the flavor has been ""improved"" which is a shocking claim in light of the absolutely digusting flavor and appearance of this pasta. Besides rice flour, it also contains rice bran, which I guess is supposed to give it a texture closer to wheat pasta. Well, it doesn't work, and it also gives the pasta a disturbing beige hue and a truly vomitous taste. My two year old and I spit it out almost simultaneously. The baby ate it, but she also eats lint, so what does she know."
1,"One of my son's favorite foods is noodles, and now that he's on a gluten-fee and corn-free diet, there wasn't much out there that he can eat. We bought these last week and tried them, and he went crazy over them! He even ate a large bowl plain, with nothing on them, then later with spaghetti sauce.<br /><br />You do need to be careful to cook them long enough that they are not a very gross version of ""al dente,"" and not to overcook them to the point where they start to dissolve and get slimy. Be sure to also rinse with cold water, as the directions on the box indicate. As other reviewers mentioned, cooking for 10 minutes seems to work well.<br /><br />We had tried one box from the grocery, and we are now planning to buy a case here at Amazon. If you are looking for alternative noodles for a gluten-free family, I definitely recommend giving these a try. My son felt like he was back to getting what everyone else gets, and that was very nice for him."
0,"HORRIBLE!<br /><br />Package said cook 5-7 minutes. Set the timer for 6 and promptly drained the pasta. Many of the spirals had broken down into...lumps. But, I stupidly figured it would be fine with sauce on it. It tasted like paste. Or, maybe envelope glue. Either way it was awful. Nobody would touch it. Thank goodness for take out Mexican food, I guess. Entire dinner went in the garbage."
0,I have bought this pasta several times. The spirals fall apart every time. It ends up being just tiny noodle pieces. I will not buy them again.
1,"This is the best wheat and gluten free pasta I have tasted, (and there have been many)"
1,We are gluten-free and this is the best rice pasta we have found.  Very important to only boil it for 10 minutes.  We love it!
1,"We just tried this product ,  do not overcook it..  we added a little pesto and  it was very good ... I did not notice an icky color, but we are used to whole grain food... overall we had very nice wheat free meal."
1,"Absolutely love the lemon & herb VERI PERI sauce.  Marinated a bunch of chicken thighs and sauteed a mixed vegetable medley of zucchini, summer squash, onion, garlic and mushroom to go with it.  Love this sauce!  It's so flavorful.  You can use it as a marinade, as a sauce in your skillet or work, it's even great as a condiment (dip).  Try it...you'll like it!!"
1,"I used to live in Africa and ""discovered"" Veri Peri on a visit to South Africa and brought some home. I was delighted to find it on Amazon.com now I'm living back in the States. However, I didn't know it came in flavors (or flavours, if you prefer). I'm looking forward to trying the garlic and the lemon & herb."
0,I ordered this thinking it would have the same wonderful character of the regular Peri peri Sauce.  Wrong!  The off taste is rather putrid to say the least.  I had to throw it away.
1,"I tried Veri Peri for the first a few weeks ago and I must say that I was very impressed with this sauce/marinade. I have since tried them all (including the Veri Hot which is not for the faint of heart) and I love them all, but I will just talk about the Lemon and Herb here. The first thing I noticed about this sauce is how many different ways you can use it. It works wonders as a marinade or you can saute with it, or use it to replace other spices and herbs you might have otherwise used. I seem to find this flavor to work best with chicken and fish but don't let my amateur opinion stifle your creativity. I love the taste of this sauce, the lemon is just strong enough to give that little bite I love in a lemon and herb sauce and there are so many more flavors waiting to jump out at you from the South African herbs. This is definitely a must try for anyone who is serious about exploring new wonderful ways to prepare food. I recommend it to everyone and I always use Veri Peri when I want my food to impress."
1,"I'm a Manhatten and old fashioned freak; best cocktails on the planet if made right. And Fee's Whiskey Barrel Aged Bitters are just about the best tasting bitters that I've, well, ever tasted...period. Use Maker's Mark or a high-end rye whiskey with Fee's (and a really good vermouth)and you'll have yourself a supremely tasty drink, my friends. My best advice is to drink alone --like all true Vikings do--and you won't have to share with anyone else.<br /><br />Nothing worse than lipstick on a glass anyway..."
1,"I decided to try these on a whim when I saw them at The Spuyten Duyvel Beer Shop in Williamsurg about a year ago. I have been a convert ever since! In fact, my usage of bitters has even gone up CONSIDERABLY since I started using them since I like them so much! They fall along the angostura lines, but have a distinctive richness and complexity. I've used them ever since and am about to pick up multiple bottles since I hate running out!"
1,"good product, good packaging, good time. nothing bad. would buy again. thanks the bitters are pretty tasty in a old fashioned. give it a go"
1,"Bought this to add to a recipe by Jason Schiffer for a Maple Manhattan.  It's a great bitters and played really well with the Bourbon and Maple Syrup I was using.  Great product!  As with any bottle of bitters, 4 oz. is going to last you a LONG, LONG time so this is a great value as well.  I don't think you can go wrong with any of the Fee Brothers bitters!  Have fun with them and experiment!"
1,This tea is very good and perfect for the price....you can't go wrong with this product. A must buy for the tea lover.
1,I make iced tea at work for the entire office. It used to be tea for me... but everyone loved the smell of my fruity tea so now its an office thing. As an office we used to go through about 3 gallons of tea a week. Now that we have the peach we go through 6! Everyone loves the delacate fruitiness and refreshingly not bitter taste of this wonderful peach tea. I highly recommend it!
1,"this was very good and rare hard to find in the usa. Im glad i got to try this. I could't stop eating it, and the whole family loved it!"
1,"Oh, boy, I guess I'm just a nut person.  Pistachio is a real winner when it comes to flavoring up halva.  The sesame flavor is great by itself, but blending it with pistachio takes it to another level.  Nutty goodness times two!  :^)"
1,"Imported from Istanbul, Turkey, Koska halva is absolutely the best and completely outdoes the competition. Personally I prefer the pistachio or chocolate varities to the plain, but all three taste wonderful. The plastic containers keep it nice and fresh. A word to the wise: this Middle Eastern treat is so outrageously good that it is hard to stop eating it. Cut yourself a quarter-inch thick slice and then put the container away immediately, otherwise you will yield to the temptation of cutting more and more slices. Also, try to control yourself and eat it once a day. Needless to say, halva goes great with strong Turkish coffee and the two together will give you quite a burst of energy. The only way you could do better than Koska is to get real homemade halva which not easily available. Enjoy!"
0,"This stuff was so bitter, i got goosebumps and shudders. I also bought some rose flavored turkish delight and same reaction. Seriously, how do they manage over there? I read reviews about this Halva being SO GOOD that you have to restrain yourself from eating it in one fell swoop. I really can't see that happening. I can see it going into the trash tho if no one else in the house will eat it. Also it was nearly impossible to just slice up as it fell apart in crumbles."
1,"These are very dense, moist snack bars; could even be a meal replacement if you're up for something smallish. There's actually 5 flavors of these, but I believe only this one (Banana Walnut) and the Chocolate Chip one are available right now (and I can't recommend the Chocolate Chip one, it does not taste good to me). I look forward to trying the Brownie and Peanut Butter versions, as well as the Cranberry one. But these are excellent.<br />Each bar contains 5g fiber, 12g whole grain, and 6g of protein. More info on this product and their other things at [...]. I only just heard of this company the other week when a relative gave me one of their bars, but their products look great (if a bit pricey; but high-quality costs more).<br />Update: these are all made much better by warming them up: remove from package, and heat them for 10-15 seconds in the microwave. Makes them smoother and softer, like soft cookies just out of the oven."
1,"[Corazonas Banana Walnut Oatmeal Squares -- reviewed a few weeks after buying them.]<br /><br />For years I've carried food-bars to eat when my blood sugar gets low, and for years I've had to deal with two kinds of bars:  the kind that are gooey with frosting or with chocolate chips that have melted in the heat; or the kind which are crunchy and crumbly.  In either case I'd have a mess on my fingers, or on my shirt, or on the furniture.<br /><br />These oatmeal squares are neither gooey or crumbly.  Instead they have a soft firm texture that's just what I want for travel.  (I can't say the same for the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003EXI9OO"">CORAZONAS Oatmeal Squares, Chocolate Chip, 1.76-Ounce bags (pack of 12)</a>, since the chocolate chips can get messy.)  They're also the right size to slip into a pocket.<br /><br />As for taste, they're pleasant, but they seem a bit bland to me, perhaps because they're low sodium.  However, taste is not my main concern when I want ""fuel"" to bring my blood sugar back up."
1,One of the best tasting bars on the market! Great taste! Fills you up! Keeps you going throug your day!
1,"I am very pleased with this product.  Great tasting with coffee for a quick breakfast. After trying the banana walnut, I discovered the chocolate chip version and ordered it. Definitely, the chocolate chip is my favorite."
1,"These squares are moist and taste pleasant. Personally, I find them too sweet and chewy. Other than the fact that they do contain too much sugar for my taste, they are a good snack."
1,"These are so good it's hard to believe they're really good for you.  Lots of healthy, yet yummy ingredients.  So glad I found these.  They are thick and chewy and taste very good."
1,"I got these for my mother.  My father is recovering from prostate cancer, and has completely changed his diet.  He treats these like desert.  He loves them, and they are so good for him.  Microwaved 15 sec, with some chopped banana a topped with greek yogurt.  They got 8 cases."
1,I cannot remember where I first heard about these oatmeal squares but I certainly am glad I did.  I love the banana walnut and also the peanut butter.  I have shared with a friend at work and now she buys them as well.<br />I take them to work with me and with some fruit that it makes a good lunch.<br />I will certainly continue to buy these - they are good tasting - good for you --- and inexpensive.
1,A friend recommended these bars and gave me one to try. I wasn't even done eating it when I ordered them in three flavors! A great healthy meal on the go.
1,Amazing taste.. lots of nuts... so tasty that it makes you wonder if it is health at all ;-)... many a days it serves as my breakfast.. personally like it better than the chocolate version
1,"This is an excellent product which we plan to continue using. Will reorder very soon to maintain stock,plan to try the dark chocolate bars next and expect the same result."
1,"This is a great quick snack or on-the-run breakfast bar. These bars are actually pretty tasty and accurately described. The banana walnut actually tasted like banana oatmeal bar and actually contained walnuts pieces. Texturally, it is fairly fibrous (hence the oats), but not overly so. Only complaint is that the size is on the smaller size, but that is more a personal preference."
1,"We normally buy these at Costco and I think they are a little cheaper (maybe a couple of bucks) although the banana walnut bars come packaged WITH the chocolate chip bars so it's sadly double money.. two boxes for $20-25 ish. I love the oatmeal bars but cannot stand the chocolate ones. And I'm a chocolate lover. The chocolate ones taste like healthfood and have a scratchy texture that isn't pleasant to swallow. However, like the banana ones, they do fill you up.<br /><br />The banana walnut bars are healthy (which is most important to me) moist, sweet (but not overpowering) and very dense for their size. So one bar and a cup of coffee fills me up for a breakfast on the go. The cholesterol lowering benefits are a HUGE plus.<br /><br />I would give this product 5 stars but I feel that the price could be slightly lower for amazon. Based on my Costco experiences I think these should run $12-13 a box -just my personal opinion. If you can't afford $15 for 12 bars then consider making your own and freezing them. I enjoy a recipe for Baked Oatmeal snack bars on the Kath Eats Real food blog, which you will have to google if amazon deletes this link: [...]<br /><br />All-in-all these bars are excellent and convenient as heck. If you don't mind the price and love having them delivered to your door then by all means order them :)"
1,We go hiking a lot -- so i decided to try out different snacks to see which ones are best for us. These were very good. I was quite surprised to find them as soft and fresh as they were. The flavor tastes sorta like banana nut muffins minus extreme amounts of sugar. It also serves as a good snack and keeps you full for 2-3 hours :)
1,Banana Walnut is a classic combo and I think this bar will be a classic.  Good texture as they are nice and chewy and great taste.  I am trying to get in shape and they are perfect for an afternoon hike.  Like a little meal crossed with a dessert.
1,"I purchased a box of chocolate chip from Costco and really enjoyed the one I ate; my 18 year old daughter discovered them and finished off the box.  I could not find them again at Costco, so I checked here...sure enough, I found them and more.  I found that banana walnut was available so I decided to give them a try and I love them. I think the taste comes very close to the real banana bread.  I am very happy with my purchase and the fast delivery."
1,This product arrived on time.  My wife loves these but they are sometimes hard to find in the stores.  Costco offers them for less when they have them which is not often.
1,"I really love these bars; they taste just like banana bread. And, they have a great chew with none of that chalkiness or heaviness that some ""all natural"" products tend to have. My local store stopped carrying these- they are totally worth having to pay shipping."
1,"These squares are delicious.  Good nutrition, and a great ski snack to have in your pack, or jacket pocket."
0,This is my 2nd purchase from amazon.  Im disappointed to receive a package of oatmeal squares that indicate a best buy date of aug 9 2011.  At least the other two boxes have a 2012 date.
0,"These banana-walnut oatmeal squares by Corazonas were a colossal disappointment. I'm a dyed-in-the-wool banana bread fan, but there were no similarities here. The texture was slimy, yet gritty and  mealy, with not a walnut in sight. The taste was primarily of oatmeal, with the slightest essence of sourish banana. They were excessively sweet...coming in at fifteen grams of sugar. I wouldn't feed these to a dog, in fact, ours took a bite and turned up her nose. She does have her standards, after all! Fortunately for us all, we had some 'Beggin' Strips standin' by for appeasement purposes. Please know that I'm not a picky eater...I've had SOS countless times and enjoyed it...but, I couldn't abide these hideous things."
1,"If you love crunchy potato chips but not the fat, these are a great choice.  I think they are great. I sometimes add salt (probably a no no) and enjoy them with lunch or as a snack.  Seem hard to find right now."
1,"I usually do not write reviews, but when something is this good i have to tell someone.  I cannot say enough good things about these.  The entire bag only has 660 calories, so when you eat one serving there are a lot of them, and if you cant stop at just one serving, you dont feel so bad.  They are gluten free, great for us celiacs, but another plus for anyone.  The spice on them is just enough of a kick, my kids love them, so they arent too spicy, otherwise they would run screaming, they have a more sensitive tounge to spicy foods.  I found these at a local organic store and started picking up 3 bags every 2 weeks.  Now I order them from amazon in bulk, they are cheaper."
1,"This is a great snack.  I first bought them for my 17 month old grandson, who has celiac disease.  He loves them; so do I.  One ounce of these chips is equivalent to one and one half servings of vegetables!  They are very lightly salted, and have 80% less fat than potato chips.  The chips are kind of cute - much smaller than potato chips and shaped like a tiny bowl.  My grandson will put one on the end of his tongue and wait for me to laugh - he's such a clown!"
1,"I bought Real Deal Veggie chips because sometimes I snack when I shouldn't.<br />The taste is great & slightly addicting.<br />They totally satisfy my late night munchie urges, with a fraction of the fat/salt etc..<br />Compared to the stuff I usually reach for.<br /><br />Obviously, not as healthy as raw veggies but who wants to deal  with all that when watching a little tv before bed."
1,"I found these at a Nutter's Health food store in Nebraska, these are to die for, and you can't eat just one, very low fat, just enough salt and so crispy you better buy more than one bag and keep them around for snacking healthy, they are hard to beat and my hubby and i have tried many kinds and so far, these are by far the best so if ya get a chance to try some, you will be hooked for life...rsgarden"
1,"I ordered these on a whim, and found them wonderful. They are tart, crisp and delicious, and made a wonderful addition to sandwiches and cheese trays."
1,"These are exceptional. I had them first at a friend's home. Her hummus was wonderful, and I asked her for her recipe. It really is the beans that make the difference. Thanks so much for your great product!!!"
1,"I am on my second 5 Lb bag of beans from Palouse, and I will keep coming back as long as the price is consistent. The quality of the beans is high: they are delicious, cook well, are packed nicely, and arrived with Amazon Prime shipping-speed (two days). I don't take advantage of the QR code identifier (to see which specific fields the product comes from), but it's a nice touch, and builds my trust in Palouse, the manufacturer.<br /><br />Palouse is now my preferred option for both these garbanzo beans and brown lentils.<br /><br />Also: I have found one pebble going through 7.5 Lbs of beans--this is a very good ratio, and means they properly sift through their beans before packaging them. Worth the price."
1,"Upon receiving the product, I started a batch soaking to get them ready to cook. I soaked the beans overnight and cooked them up in the pressure cooker (after watching Good Eats episode on garbanzos/chickpeas). I am very happy with the quality of the beans. The cooked up tender and tasty. I used some in a soup, added some to a couple of salads and blended the rest up to make hummus. Each time I reflected on how much better I liked them over canned beans (even when cooked unsalted) and the last batch of dried chick peas I bought in the store. The burlap bag is kind of cool and the beans are in a plastic bag inside of that. Out of four cups of measured uncooked beans, I only encountered two beans that did not cook up soft. I will buy these again."
1,"I am ordering these right now, simply because they are grown in the USA.  I am thrilled to buy American and will do so whenever I can.  Thank you for giving me this opportunity, I am sick of foreign foods with questionable safety standards."
1,"These are very good, high quality Garbanzo Beans. I purchased these Garbanzo Beans for making raw hummus with, and I was not disappointed. They are very large and very good. They don't have that ""off"" taste that some garbanzo beans have. They make the best raw hummus I have ever made. They arrived plastic bag, inside a nice burlap sack. The beans were very clean and I have yet to come across a bad bean.<br /><br />High quality bean, excellent taste. You can't beat the price, and 5 lbs. goes a very long way!<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product."
1,"I was a little nervous about ordering beans online, but am I glad I did! I make a lot of chick pea stews and hummus and I am amazed by the quality, texture and taste of these beans. If you are tired of canned beans, get these from Palouse and cook them up yourself. You will not be disappointed!"
1,"WOW!  I don't think I've ever had a real fresh garbanzo before because I've never tasted one this good.  I've never worked with dry beans before but this was real easy.  Soak over night and boil for an hour.  Couldn't be easier.  And the taste of these is so amazing, I enjoyed eating them plain, in salads, cooked with a little chorizo, possibilities are endless.  Next I'm going to make hummus with them.  And they are on prime!!  (I LOVE prime!)  So I never have to be without them.  I can't believe I waited so long to try these.<br /><br />As far as the company goes, I had an issue with my whole shipment so I contacted them and they responded in minutes. (excellent customer service).  First I had to contact amazon and then them again if it couldn't be solved.(I know, rookie mistake, contact amazon first)  But of course amazon took care of it with out problem (also excellent customer service).  Things are going to happen and it's comforting to know that if I have an issue it gets taken care of so easily.  I will definitely be ordering these garbanzos and other products from this company through amazon again.  I hope you love them as much as I do!"
1,"I had been eating, and thoroughly enjoying, Bush brand canned garbanzos as a vegetarian low glycemic index source of protein.  Sometimes my store doesn't have them in stock so I decided to buy dry and cook them myself.  I must say I prefer this way because I have the option of adding salt ot not.  These garbanzos are delicious plain and I often eat them that way.  Especially when I'm just having a couple tablespoons to get me through a hungry patch during the day.  I also add them to my bowls of cooked vegetables, along with olive oil, sea salt, pepper, etc., and nutritional yeast flakes. The garbanzos really round out the meal by adding substance and staying power to the vegetables.  I always make hummus for company and although I haven't made it yet with these garbanzos I have no doubt whatsoever that the hummus will be even better made with fresh beans.  After ordering I received an email from the grower thanking me and providing a link to their website.  To me this was a nice touch and the website is useful.  I found cooking directions there and as someone who can no longer read print I very much appreciate it when I can find directions online.  If you follow their cooking directions you cook one cup of beans and you get 2.5 cups of cooked.  Now I can easily eat 2.5 cups within the three days that they should be used but for calorie control reasons I freeze half of the cooked beans so I can stretch out how many days a batch lasts.  I'm totally happy with these beans and grateful for Amazon as a way to buy quality food I could not otherwise obtain."
1,"The product arrived in less time than expected, in a neat burlap sack, with a QR code showing te exact lot of land this particular bag of beans was harvested from. I cooked up a large batch right away, and they are delicous and perfect. We love that they are a USA grown product. I found my new source for dry staples, and will be back to order more."
1,Hesitantly I purchased these dried beans but they turned out to be wonderful. Soak over night and they are ready for your recipes in the morning. I made hummus with these beans and some Sesame King Tahini... it was WONDERFUL. I made several batches and added different flavorings. Serve with fresh vegetables and so good for you!
1,"My wife likes hummus and I didn't so I figered I would try to make it myself and if I needed to I could make it with a flaver that I liked. Didn't have to do alot of trying with these as the base. They were fresh, clean and tasted great. I like the burlap bag too."
1,great garbanzo beans... was very pleased.. I have cooked some and used them in salad as well as making some hummus.. I have also sprouted some .. I will definitely re-order them . I am glad that they are gmo free and grown in the U S A.
1,I was very impressed with the freshness of these beans.  They sprouted within 24 hours.  I will definitely buy again.
1,"These are absolutely delicious. The flavor, texture, everything is wonderful. There is no similarity between these & those canned things.<br />I just placed a 2nd order because I didn't want to risk running out of them."
1,"I had never used dried beans before so I was a little apprehensive about buying these, but it turns out they are super simple. I soak them over night in water. I then boil them with salt for about 90mins or until they are very soft. I use them to make hummus with. I use about two cups of cooked beans, 2-3tbs of tahini, 1/3 cup of olive oil, 2tbs of fresh lemon juice, and 3tbs of capers. I know that capers may sound weird but they really do add something. Everyone who eats this hummus loves it. There is also a recipe on Dr. OZ website for chickpea popcorn and that was my intention with these but have yet to get around to making it, but its another way to use these beans if you get tired of hummus. They don't taste anything like canned beans. Its truly amazing how different they taste."
1,"Looking for affordable organic food that will stock the pantry.  I tried this company for the first time and are very pleased with them.  The beans are clean and nicely packed, and I feel safe eating them and serving them to the people I love.  Thanks go out to the kind and wonderful farmers who grew them for me.  I appreciate the work very much.  And btw, 5 pounds of beans works out to a lot of garbanzo beans!  They will last us for several months!  Highly recommend."
1,"very fresh garbanzo beans, soaked only for couple hours, boiled for 1 hr - that's how fresh they are. Clean and fresh. Didn't have such a good quality for long time Thanks a lot"
1,"I dont know that these taste any different than any other dry chic peas, but they do taste great. The main thing for me though is the peace of mind that comes from knowing that they are GMO free. I really dont want any of my money going to Monsanto and their ilk, and would probably forgo chic peas forever if i didnt have that option. That would make me sad, as they are a staple of my diet. Fortunately, i dont have to make that choice.<br />Also, the packaging is appealing. Not a contributing factor in buying these, but nice nonetheless.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
1,"These beans a exceptional and make the very best hummus.<br />I'm ordering my second bag within a month. (and trust me..<br />this bag makes a LOT of hummus.  So far, I've made 30 cups of hummus<br />and still have some beans left over)<br />Do yourself a favor and grab a bag... you won't be<br />disappointed."
1,"Once you make these, you won't ever eat chickpeas from a can again. Ever. This is an amazing product.<br /><br />I like that you can see the field where the beans are grown. I like that they aren't genetically modified. I like that I control the salt. These make amazing hummus, wonderful to just eat in any way you like chickpeas.<br /><br />Support small farmers. Buy these beans!"
1,Might be crazy - but I LOVE that I can track back to see where these beans were grown.  That's super cool.  Even better that it is NOT in Mexico.  The quality of the product is terrific - and the packaging is ... well ... fun.  It just feels like high quality from beginning to end.  PLUS - buying these beans is supporting American farmers.  Maybe I am old fashioned - but that is important to me.  Thanks for a great product - I will buy again.
1,I bought this product to make channa masala.  It was interesting to see the reaction of the people who  only previously had canned chickpeas.  These were delicious and well worth the effort.  I only bought the 3 # pack to try them.  The next order will be for a larger quantity.
1,These are good beans. Not shriveled. Made a nice batch of hummus with them after soaking in crock pot for a few hours.
1,I just made delicious hummus with the garbanzo beans. The beans are way better than what I could get in the local grocery store. I am very happy with the quality and will buy from this seller again :)
1,"Good quality beans!  Made some great hummus, which was my objective.  Better looking than some I found at my grocery store."
1,"Delicious Garbanzos! A 3 pound sack seemed rather small, though. A five-pounder might have been a better buy, maybe. Supersaver shipping makes this a pretty good deal. I'll be buying another sack again at a later date, for sure."
0,"Not a chickpea expert, and these seemed fine, but nothing extraordinary.  I just bought a bag at the indian grocer for $4.00 vs $14 for these.  These seem awfully expensive."
1,"This stuff is awesome. At least I think so. I use it a lot to make Coffee Buttercream frosting. Also I've used it in cookies. I like it for the coffee flavor, and use it less for enhancing chocolate. I add Espresso powder to my baking too. Good quality. If you don't want to buy the entire quantity, I have spotted this same extract at Sunflower Market."
0,"Got some of this at wally world ...maybe it was old or something but it was awful....bitter...useless....i threw it out...this price here is ridiculous... NOT RECOMONDED !!!! One reason I did buy it was because it was not in a clear bottle, olive oil should never be in a clear bottle, but when the oil in it is lousy i guess it doesent matter. Cant blame this on china i guess :|"
1,"This corn attracts more birds and squirrels than both my other feeders combined. Good deal bulk purchase, will definitely purchase more."
1,I have used mix this for over 20 years.  I have friends from the West to East coast who love my Enchiladas.
1,"I started using Lawry's Enchilada Sauce seasonings packets years ago when we lived in CA. When we moved to MN 20 years ago I was able to find it in stores here but in the last couple of years it has been unavailable. I have requested the stores start carring it again, to no avail. I was so excited to learn I could order it through Amazon and did. One hint, I sift out all the dried onion flakes before I add the remaining spices to the tomato paste. I prefer to sprinkle fresh green onion over the homemade cheese covered Enchiladas or Chili Rellenos along with a couple of dollops of sour cream and 2 or 3 olives.<br /><br />Wonderful!"
1,"I have used this for at least 25 years.  I do not like spicy things so this is perfect as it's mild yet flavorful.  I use for beef enchiladas but also add to my hamburger for tacos, burritos, etc.  My family and guests always love anything I prepare with this sauce. Old label used to indicate you could use an 8 oz can of tomato sauce and 2 1/2 cans of water rather than the tomato paste, and this is the method I still use.  Always try to have some prepared on-hand as it's so good."
1,"I am not a yanky,but I am not from Mexico or a border state,(California,Arizona,New Mexico,or Texas)so I found I like the Mexican food but I didn't know how to fix it. I had used other Lawry mixes, and saw the Enchilada mix when shopping and tried it and my family was amazed that I could cook and prepare good enchiladas. It was my secret. Lawry's Enchilada mix and I can work wonders!"
1,An American friend lives in Norway and can't get enchiladas or enchilada sauce. (She can't really get canned tomatoes either.) Her request was for the enchilada sauce she grew up with. So she gets a case of enchilada sauce. With any luck it will last a year....
1,"My husband makes the best red chili enchiladas. Unfortunately, they do not carry Lawry's Enchilada Sauce in grocery stores in Albuquerque.  Which is odd since enchiladas are one of the staples for meals in New Mexico.  Finding it here on Amazon has been terrific.  My family can get back to eating their favorite enchiladas. Being able to buy it by the case is an advantage, also."
1,"This is my go-to enchilada sauce mix. I'm not a fan of spicy, so it's perfect for me.  My kids love it too. Good flavor. For some reason, my local Safeway stores stopped carrying it. Thank goodness for Amazon!  I'm all stocked up now. yay!"
1,"I have always been a fan of Lawry's seasonings, but when I couldn't find the enchilada sauce or taco seasonings in our grocery store I went online and found both on Amazaon.com.  I was thrilled!  I won't make enchildas or tacos without Lawry's!"
1,"This is my absolute favorite packaged Enchilada Sauce mix.  It's better than any other packaged mix or jarred Enchilada Sauce that you can buy.  When prepared, it's not too thin and not too thick, consistency-wise.  I can definitely tell a BIG difference in my chicken enchiladas when I have to use a different sauce mix.  My husband and kids love these enchiladas when I use this sauce mix- they can even tell the difference. Lawry's is the best, hands down."
1,What can I say I went over to a friends house for supper and they fed me Enchilada's which I had never had one before.  I liked them so much I asked them to give me the recipe so I need the sauce mix went to my favorite shopping on line store an sure enough Amazon had it.  I ordered it and used it and will continue to order this product until I drop dead from eating too much Enchilada's.
1,"This enchilada sauce is the best...much better than the canned varieties you find in stores. And each package makes a good amount (the equivalent of about three normal cans from the grocery store), so it is much more economical.<br /><br />I live overseas and can't find enchilada sauce, which made making our tasty Mexican dishes impossible. I tried making my own but didn't find a recipe that tasted good. Happily, I buy this when I'm in the U.S. each year and can easily bring it back with me. I am so glad I found this product, and I can honestly say it's the best I have had."
0,I have made my own sauce from scratch in the past but thought I'd give this a try. It is too sweet and has no heat to it. Tastes more like spagetti sauce.
1,"So far I have purchased enough for six gallons of this refreshing drink. It is amazing. It is thirst quenching without creating a need to keep drinking. It is soothing and delicious. I have tried other brands, but they don't equal this one. The purveyor is outstanding in service and packaging."
1,"This is the only brand of Horchata mix that I drink.  I've tried other mixes and most of them have that powdery taste.  The Fiesta brand is one that I'm very familiar with.  I grew up in San Diego where it's easy to get authentic mexican food and a large Horchata, and I always remembered the Fiest logo on the drink mixers.  So when I found out I could get the same thing at home, I knew I wouldn't have to look any further for the Horchata taste I know and love."
1,"After reading the reviews, I tried it. I love it but, it takes so much concentrate for one cup. It's bit pricy for the amount of cups. However, I would buy it again."
1,I tried Horchata at a Mexican restaurant and loved the drink. I live in an area where Horchata in a restaurant is very hard to come by. So I have tried several Horchata drink mixes in an effort to find a way to make it at home.  This one is the ONLY one that tastes like the kind I had in the restaurant.  I definitely recommend this drink concentrate!
1,"I've tried many mixes to duplicate the Agua de Horchata I had at a mexican shop. This is the BEST!!! If you have ever made horchata, save the hours of waiting and get this concentrate. You won't be dissapointed."
1,not the best but its good! i like products without splenda and highfructose corn syrup and this has none of those.  this makes our stomach aches go away. my kids love it as well as everyone else.  the only one so far ive tasted thats better is natures horchata. but its very hard to come by horchata except with splenda in our stores. so i would buy this again
1,"Pretty good product, especially for being a concentrate. A friend had brought into work some home made horchata using his families recipe and let me try it. I tested our friendship by drinking most of it. That was the first time I had tried horchata. Well I had been hooked and wanted to get some for home. I ordered 2 bottles of this concentrate. The first bottle I used water, the second 1% milk. I definitely recommend using milk. It was very close to being home made. Needs to be stirred every time before pouring. But the taste was there. Shipping was quick. Slightly pricey. Will order again when I need a fix."
1,"This Horchata drink tasted just as good as the many many Mexican Restaurants I have been to in Texas. It is more on the cinnamon side than most I think. -- Use as much as you want to make it as sweet as you want. (It was sort of expensive, however.)"
1,"I bought the Klass and other powders... none compare to this syrup!  Im in Iraq right now and we have 1 liter water bottles here all over the place, one horchata bottle will make 4 liter waterbottles worth!  It goes fast!"
1,"This drink is sweet and sugary. The carbohydrate content (how much is sugar?) is listed as 27 grams. A serving size is 8oz. I used four to five tbsp to make a 12oz cup. I wouldn't recommend this for diabetics. You can used less, but it will taste watery. The drink is delicious though."
0,"This thing might be 5""-7"" however the fact that its the size of a pencil round is beyond ridiculous. I spent $6 more on one for my larger dog and that was well worth the money, this little thing was worth about half I paid. Buyer beware, the photos shown are of their larger bones, they just use them with the smaller ones to make it seem like your getting your moneys worth!! There is no way a 40lb dog would get real use out of this, maybe a 5lb dog!! What a joke!!"
0,"I shopped around a little after purchasing this antler chew, and I really don't think this one was a good deal. It is about 6 inches long, as advertised, but pretty thin. Also my dog, who usually goes crazy for elk antlers, isn't really interested in chewing it. I recommend ordering from Grateful Shed Antler Chews instead."
1,"I never give my therepy dogs any food product made overseas.  I am alway concerned about lead and what ever else goes into products my dogs digest.  I friend told me about elk antlers.  I was very interested having read this was a natural product.  I also wanted something that would be hard like a bone to help with oral care and reduce plaque.  Well, my dogs love this! They chew for hours.  I belong to Windwalker Humane Coalation and could not wait to share this product at our next meeting.  I shared the information, now more dogs are loving this product."
1,"I have an eight-month old Boston terrier puppy, so I will admit that she is probably much smaller than most dogs using this toy--but she is a CHEWER. This is one of the few toys that lasts more than a day for her! She loves it, and is always gnawing it at. It gets smaller, but so far I've found no sharp pieces or large chunks that could be a choking hazard."
1,"I have never seen a dog love a toy as much as my dog loves her deer antler! These are great, and the perfect size for my little Shih Tzu / Yorkie mix. Great deal and fast shipping too!"
1,"This is a great deal on antlers.  My dogs love them, and they last a long time.  They arrive quickly, and as advertised."
1,My Dog is 12 years old. His vet says he has the cleanest teeth she has ever seen. We believe this is because he loves antlers whether deer or elk. We had been able to find our own but ran out. I had to find an alternative source. This product is great! He loves it.
1,We got this for our 10 week old puppy who was chewing everything and everyone in the house. I was very happy with the purchase. The antler is large and our puppy really enjoys chewing on it. It has been 6 weeks since we got it and it shows very little wear even though he chews on it daily. I will buy one again in the future.
1,"I got this for my boston terrier, he seems to love it!  He chased it around the house, pushing it along the floor, for a couple hours straight.<br /><br />Edit: it is now his favorite toy!"
1,"I have used the antler to carve something, instead of giving It to a dog. The antler was very sturdy and did not chip at all. I am very satisfied and can only suggest it to other customers. Whether you use it as a treat for your dog, or use it for an art project... It is very high in quality."
1,"This product was purchased for burnishing wood projects. It's 100% elk rack which is what I needed. If it had been fake, I would'nt have been able to use it.  Arrived within 2 days using first class mail."
1,Items were just as described. The dogs went absolutely bonkers over them! The only downside of that is that I need to order more now; I may go up a size this time in hopes that they will last longer than a month.
1,Good product.  Most of my dogs like it but do not chew on it all the time like I thought they would.  For the cost I thought that they would love it.  There are many times they will choose a different bone and let this one sit. Probably will not buy this product again because of cost.
1,"Both our dogs, a pom who loves to chew and a pug who normally doesn't chew bones absolutely loved these elk antlers, they would chew for hours if we would let them. We will definitely be buying more, but it looks like these will last a long time."
0,We have an Australian Shephard puppy and she's been working on this antler for a few days now and she's given up.  It's just too hard for her to enjoy.  Perhaps she will enjoy it when she's a little older.
1,"Maybe we just got the luck of the draw, and I get the feeling that some antlers can be harder or softer within a single 'brand.' But I ordered this antler and it was at least 7"" long, as pictured, and wears slowly."
1,We have ordered antlers from many onlint sources and have found most have inferior quality.  This brand has always been a great value and great quality.  I  would reccommend this brand to anyone looking for antlers.......Why would you buy from some online store when you can have the best from Amazon!
1,I have 2 dogs (mini poodle 11# and bichon frise/mini poodle 12#) and they both enjoy gnawing on these natural antlers.  I feel comforted in knowing that they are not chewing and ingesting the plastic chew toys (going in the recycle bin) anymore but a natural and humanely produced product.  Although a little on the pricey side for a chew snack - it will last a very long time.
1,"My miniature Golden Retriever looks like he is making love with this thing. It's so funny to watch him chew and massage it with care.  He's my service dog, so I appreciate a healthy, non messy treat that keeps him boredom free while I get through my day . I'm a Soldier and can eaily slide this in my trouser pocket and carry it on the go.  I tried local sstore versions and wasted my money - bleached white with no flavor.  I can take the CHASING OUR TAILS brand and boil with a buillon cube for 6 minutes to soften a bit; then pull back the harder exterior with needle nose pliers to expose more marrow for more hours of chewing.  A subsription is the only  way to go.  My dog's teeth are gleaming WHITE and his breath is pleasant. He should be in commercials to prove how important it is for dogs to chew. I will send Chasing our tails a picture of his teeth when I get time."
1,I see a lot of reviews complaining of the size. Mine arrived yesterday and is 7 inches long and as thick as the one pictured. I have no complaints whatsoever. Maybe it's the luck of the draw. Has more marrow than any other antler I have bought. Dog loves it.
1,I've bought 2 of these so far for my 1 year beagle that loves to chew. He loves them and goes between this and his retriever rolls. Received the antlers quickly both times and they were very clean and the perfect size for my chewer.
1,"I have 2 american cocker spaniels. At least 1 of them is chewing or gnawing at this every day, they LOVE it! It is still the same size after 30 days."
1,"My dog eats raw meat.  She powers through anything I give her in less than 10 minutes, even meat with bone, which means she doesn't get her teeth as clean as they could be if she took more time.  I bought this product to give her more chewing time.<br /><br />When I first took it out of the package, she responded with interest, but then when I handed the antler to her, she seemed to lose interest, as if she didn't know quite what to do with it.  Eventually she took it outside and buried it.  The next night she brought it back in, and I took it away and put it in water (advice I got from others) to soften it and release some of the flavor.<br /><br />After that, she was more interested and will now gnaw and gnaw on the antler, and lick the marrow.  I limit her time with it in case she chews hard enough to break a tooth.  She started with the wider end of the antler.<br /><br />The product looks almost exactly like the photo.  It is about 7"" long and a good size for a small to medium dog with strong jaws (we have a Jack Russell terrier)."
1,These elk antlers are great chew toys. I have a german shepard and pitbull who chew rawhide bones practically instantly. I was sick of constantly buying chew toys so I thought I would try the elk antlers and I'm very impressed! The dogs have been chewing for hours and the chews still look new!
1,"This is the second time we've ordered a Chasing Our Tails Elk Rack Snack.  Our Pug, even though she's only small about 20lbs, loves these things!  She holds them between her paws and goes to town on it.  No pieces come off and it doesn't stain the carpet.  Keeps her busy for a long time."
0,"These Elk antlers are dangerous - they splintered and shattered, and I worried that our dog might have swallowed sharp shards!  We have used deer antlers and they never splintered at all."
0,The items came well packaged and in a timely manner.  I am giving it 2 stars because out of the package it had dirt and what smelled like animal excrement on it.  I cleaned it twice before giving it to my dog.  The rack was almost completely black out of the package and after cleaning it myself it was the light brown that they normally are....but it has still retained the bad odor.  My dog is hesitant to use it because of the bad smell.  I have ordered other elk racks before and just be forewarned that this company does not clean the rack before shipment.  Other companies do.  I did not purchase this expecting to have to clean the dirt and animal excrement off it.  I'll be purchasing my next one (which is probably very soon since my dog won't touch this one) from another company.
1,These are so yummy.  They have the same nice corn taste as corn nuts but they are much lighter and easier on the teeth.  The barbeque flavor is perfect.  My local health food store charges a mint for these so I was excited to find them on Amazon.
1,"I've tried many, many brands and types of noodles.  Mrs. Weiss' Kluski are the best noodles you can buy.  They taste just like homemade noodles without all the work."
1,"Wonderful texture, great taste.  Thank you, Mrs. Weiss, for helping me remember my grandma's cooking."
1,I make a chicken noodle soup that just can't be made without these noodles. Even my Grandmother who made her noodles from scratch loved my version.
1,"Kluski noodles have been a part of my family for as long as I can remember - both for my mom's exceptional tuna casserole, and just noodle side dishes.  All of my area grocery stores stopped carrying this noodle.  Gratefully I can still find them on Amazon, and buying in bulk made them very inexpensive.  Not a problem to have a case in my household.  I am now supplying friends who also prefer this pasta and can't find it.  Yum....."
1,They came packaged very nicely for shipping. They are excellent top quality noodles that take 16 minutes approximately to cook. They are made in Canada and I believe they are made of top quality ingredients and have a nice one year freshness date on them. They tasted very very good. I hope Amazon someday has the 12 each of the 16 ounce bags of this type of noodles with free shipping. That would be really nice. These are great noodles. No regrets here.
1,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001228QWY"">Mrs. Weiss Kluski Enriched Egg Dumpling Noodles, 8-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />This is a wonderful product that residents in California have not had much opportunity to purchase.<br />It is readily available in the East.<br />Thanks to AMAZON, they secured a case for me and delivered it to my Brentwood, CA home.<br /><br />The item is a perfect accompaniment to Chicken Noodle soup or just by themselves with a little butter.<br />Their texture is unmatched unless you make, roll and cut your own.<br />The availability of this product, in our home, preserves an old family tradition for us."
1,These noodles are the best if you are making chicken noodle soup.  They have a flavor that other noodles don't have.  My family loves them!
1,"When the grocery stores here (NM) stopped carrying these I asked friends to ship them to me. I was delighted to be able to find them on line. These are like my grandmother's noodles- they are a little bit chewy, they can withstand being re-heated, an they actually taste like something. I have found that most noodles have no flavor, but these have a smooth egg flavor that adds to the recipe instead of just being a filler. I will be ordering more soon- our 12 bags are already gone!!"
1,"This is one of my favorite salts made by Woody's. I received it as a sample when I ordered some of their other flavors. It's got a unique flavor that is good on pasta, pizza, eggs, and other dishes. Very addictive."
1,Great product!!! The merchandise came in on time. I always love the way Almond Roca is made :D Thank you!!!
1,"The vending machine at work carries this variety in 1.25oz bags.  Great product.  Simple, natural ingredients (Dry roasted almonds, cashews, pistachios, evaporated cane sugar, tapioca syrup, blueberry, pomegranate, sea salt, natural flavors).  And if it matters (in the 1.25oz bag):  180 calories, 8g net carbs (11 - 3g fiber).  Delicious.  There's enough in the pack to make for good snack.  I was somewhat surprised that the price on Amazon was not cheaper (figured I could do better than the vending machine @ 1.25 per pack.  strange.). Guess I've got a good thing going:)<br />Bottom line:  If you want a trail mix that's simple and tasty, this is definitely worth a try."
1,I got this as a gift from my grandparents when I was doing a cross country trip. Can we say yummy! I'm totally hooked and I love that it doesn't have peanuts.
1,"I found this product on a US Airways flight and have been HOOKED ever since.  It's actually very good for you, not too high a sugar content.  The flavor is UNBELIEVABLE!  W/out doubt the most scrumptious trail-mix I have EVER tasted, and I'm not a big trail-mix fan.  It's lightly sweet and salty at the same time.  A very satisfying snack you can feel good about.  TRY IT, u will love it!"
1,This is such a delicious snack! Costco carries a big bag of it which is a little more cost effective but these smaller bags that Amazon carries are more convenient. My family thoroughly enjoyed this and will definitely buy more again.
1,"My nephew told me about these when he purchased in an airport for a snack.  The description alone intrigued me.  He and I then went on Amazon to see if they had them, and three days later, they arrived.  I love these for a snack during the work day. They are delicious, and give me the crunch I crave, and the pop of blueberry/pomegranate sweetness that I love with it.  The second best thing is that they are healthy, especially compared to the other snacks I tend to grab.  GREAT find my nephew, and thanks Amazon for the reasonable pricing."
1,Awesome snack...bought them on a flight and ended up ordering some online.  My husband likes them also and he is not much for this kind of snack.
1,"I got this as part of a gift basket here on Amazon and I'm back here to add it to my wishlist.  It's delicious stuff.  It's the perfect mixture of salty and sweet, fruity and nutty.  It is also just sticky enough to stay together in crunchy chunks, but not so sticky that your hands are covered in goo while you're eating.  Recommended."
1,Excellent product.  A healthy good tasting choice for snack time.  I would love to find this in a larger size.
1,"Delicious. I used to be able to buy a large bag at a membership warehouse. After my family was hooked, they no longer stocked this item. I was so happy to find it on Amazon, though in little snack bags."
1,"Solid snack, tastes great, seems to be made of high-quality ingredients, priced well, ships fast, filling and tasty. What more should I say?"
1,"This is the best trail mix I have ever eaten.  I wish that it was available at a store near me, but I can order it from Amazon if that's the way it goes.  It is delicious, really takes care of my sweet tooth, and is crunchy to boot!  I love it!"
1,"I first tried Mareblu Naturals on a US Air flight in first class. It was super healthy, delicious, and just exactly what I needed. I looked for this product every where in the grocery stores where I live (Major city) but it was not available. I think the price offered on Amazon was very reasonable. I will keep buying this as long as it's not offered in the stores, where I can just go and pick it up whenever I feel my sweet tooth is kicking in..."
1,"Found these on a US Air flight. I was unable to find in stores locally. Checked amazon and found them. Price is good, we did the auto shipment program, this works well for us. Just as we are about to finish last bag a new shipment comes.<br /><br />Tastes great, low fat, and gluten free. These have a nice flavor, salty sweet and crunch all in one. Kids love them as well as the adults in the household. I have recommended these to many friends and family."
1,"Mareblu Trail Mix is great in every flavor, but this is my very favorite.  It's a snack, but I eat it as a dessert.  It's good with yogurt, and it's good with oatmeal.  I keep some in the car and it never loses it's crunch."
1,Yes - these are fabulous -- hard to stop eating at the serving size!  I've tried a bunch of the different varieties and think the blueberry pomegranate is the best.<br />Unfortunately Costco isn't carrying it anymore - but we're at least happy it can be purchased online.
1,"I had been buying this tea directly from Gevalia for about $6 a box + s/h for ages. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this product being offered through Amazon at a reduced price. I decided to buy a pkg of 3 and see how fresh they were. The product arrived on time as promised and was as fresh as when I normally bought them from Gevalia - all at a significantly lower price. Winner!! I have found a new source for my Green Mountain Tea.<br /><br />Now, if Amazon can just start stocking some of the Gevaila ground coffees that I normally drink I would be able to take care of all of my hot beverage needs at one place."
0,"Dont waste your money, Gevalia is repackaging its brand, but if this tea is a sample, forget it. I'm not a green tea afficianodo (sp?) but this is no more tasteful than hot tap water. So if indeed green tea has medicinal qualities, I'm using it for that."
1,Its a good Green Tea. Very easy to drink if that makes sense. For the price its really a great deal. When you open the box you see that Gevalia really tries hard to make a great product. I would recommend to my friends.
1,"I use this product in a commercial kitchen and bakery.  It has an incredibly fresh and clean orange scent, with no bitterness or alcohol scent.  It is quite concentrated, and I've found that you can use about half of what a recipe calls for.<br /><br />I also add about 1/4 teaspoon per cup of orange juice required in a recipe to give the finished product extra orange flavor.  This product contributes nicely to the overall smell and taste of a finished product."
1,Shipped to us fast; smells & tastes fresh as an orange. I make mocha valencia's espresso's & this is 1st class.<br />4 parts dark cocoa/3 parts orange to a standard shot espresso. Top off w/ milk & your day's starting cloudless.
1,"my rescue dog has always thrown up a lot. a few times a week at times.<br />he also likes to eat grass. i switched around to various dog foods looking for the answer. after buying blue buffalo life protection he has only thrown up once in a month. he has also quit eating grass. i didn't have to blend blue buffalo with how old dog food. i just poured it in his bowl and he loved it. this is a PICKY dog as well. some dog foods he just wouldn't eat. i know that blue buffalo has superior ingredients to most grocery stores food. this has made a BIG difference in the way he looks and act as well. not having to clean up dog throw up a few times a week is worth the extra cost between cheap dog food and great dog food. the dogs that died from poisons in their food were from cheap, artificial ingredients. i love my dog so much i would do anything and spend anything to keep him around longer. wouldn't you?"
1,"This hands down is the BEST dog food I have ever purchased in the almost 50 years I have had dogs. My chubby Rat Terrier has easily lost weight on BLUE and is maintaining now. My dogs' coats are healthy. My dogs are active and healthy at 11 and 7 years old! Thank you BLUE!! And thank you Amazon for the free shipping. I can't lift more than 8 pounds, so shipping this to my home is a God Send:)"
1,I am in Alaska and my dog's food was no where to be found.<br />I was able to get it from Amazon with free shipping.  TO ALASKA!!<br />It arrived in a very timely manner and even the postal clerk was shocked that I could buy dog food like this with FREE shipping.<br />I am VERY pleased.<br />My dog LOVES blue Buffalo and I did not want to change her food so I am VERY pleased that I was able to get it.<br />I give you a five star plus!!!!!
1,"Our pug has flourished on this food.  He suffered from a bit of acne on his muzzle, and after eating BLUE, it's cleared up.  He's lost a few pounds and is now at his ideal weight.  He loves the food and we can see the benefits of this product.  We highly recommend it!"
1,We have used this dog food for quite some time and think the nutritional value is worth the price. I am very disappopinted however that I am finding that<br />the 15 lb bag has not been available. The smaller one is too small and the larger one would get stale before my terrier could consume it all. Have been forced to go to the local pet store and they didn't have the 15 lb either. Got stuck with the smaller bag and paid as much for it as I have paid for the 15 lb with Amazon
1,"My dog loves this food.  As soon as I feed him he scarfs it down.  He would sniff his old food and eventually get around to eating it, not w/ this food.  He absolutely love it.  I will definitely be buying this again."
1,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009YWMVM"">Blue Buffalo Weight Control Formula Dry Dog Food, 15-Pound Bag</a><br /><br />The 5 stars are from my two fat Hot Dogs. They just love the little nuggets.<br /><br />As for whether or not it shall help slim them down, it's too early to tell but I sure hope so."
0,I love and my dogs love blue buffalo...but this particular bag was mostly life source bits. (compared to the last bag I bought.  Lets put it this way...poured 1 cup and only 10 pieces of meat bits and the rest life source bits.  Can't possibly be healthy and has made me a little gun shy of ordering this particular version of dog food.
1,I first purchased this product for my cats at Whole Foods. They went nuts over it. It was fun to watch them sit and eat it! They went a bit goofy too. My mistake of leaving the lid off 24/7 - as it lost it's oompf! But they still ate it! My cats recommend it!
0,"The product image you see is an image of the 5 (FIVE) pound gummy bear. Not of the .5 (POINT FIVE) one.<br /><br />Also, in the description it says "".5 pound gummy bear"". That's just deceptive. They know everyone's going to be looking for the 5 pound one, and thinking this is it, since that's a picture of the larger bear.<br /><br />Deceptive. Wrong. Uncool.<br /><br />Do not buy. (I've bought the 5 pound one. I easily recognize its dimensions. You're welcome.)"
1,"I love this buffalo wing sauce. It is the best blend of flavor and spice. I've used it for wings and shrimp, both come out great."
1,"Being in the Middle East(definitely not the South), it is wonderful to have a taste of home. As always your product is spot on in the flavor department, no need to add anything, just heat and eat."
1,"The Margaret Homes Seasoned Field Peas and Snaps are very tasty and different from any ""ordinary"" canned beans. The snaps add interesting flavor.  The ""field peas"" I'm familiar with more closely resemble ""black-eyed peas"", but these smaller, firmer peas are more flavorful.<br /><br />Margaret Holmes products are ""Southern"" canned vegetables.  My very Southern grandmother (God bless her) could not cook any vegetables without a thick slab of fat-back (very fatty bacon), which she called ""seasoning"".  I must admit, her vegies were very tasty, if unhealthy.  I have found that generous use of good olive oil <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FQV5C"">Colavita Extra Virgin Olive Oil - 17oz. bottle</a> and a tablespoon of Hormel Bacon Bits (actually ham chips) <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NERTSE"">Hormel Premium Real Crumbled Bacon</a> can duplicate Grandma's ""seasoning"".  These go very well with Margaret Holmes' products.<br /><br />I use the Field Peas and Snaps to make a great, almost instant, soup or stew.  Ingredients: 1 15oz can Seasoned Field Peas and Snaps: 1 1/2 cup water; 1/4 cup olive oil; 1/2 cup wild rice blend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G82L62"">Lundberg Wild Blend, Gourmet Blend of Wild and Whole Grain Brown Rice, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>; 1/4 cup of Hormel Bacon Bits.  Mix ingredients and bring to a boil for 30 minutes to 1 hour.  Try it, it is truly a fantastic hearty satisfying soup---especially on those days when you are out of fresh ingredients.  Makes 2 large servings.  The peas are already spicy, so do NOT add pepper unless you are VERY sure you want more pepper.  The peas are also very salty---if making soup, you may wish to drain the beans rather than use the salty ""juice"".  If you use the juice AND add chipped ham---I guaranttee that the soup will be much too salty.<br /><br />You can use the same recipe with pork hocks instead of ham chips, for a VERY economical, VERY tasty dinner.  Boil the pork hocks (1 per person) by themselves for 2 hours (in addition I usually roast them until they begin to brown), then add the other ingredients and boil on low for 30 minites to 1 hour.<br /><br />For my reviews of the Lunberg Wild Rice, Hormel Bacon Bits, or Colovita Olive Oil, click on ""See all my reviews"" at the beginning of this review."
1,"I use this all the time, its just great texture and fine so there are no pieces that are not dissolved in food...Natural is always good."
1,"I have had this salt before, I needed minerals desperately and it worked like a charm. When I tried buying it via my local health food store they recommended another product and I bought it. Two weeks later I had had it! I was missing my pink salt, the other products is in my cupboard still, sometimes I use it for cooking, but the pink salt travels with me wherever I go. I actually have some in my car, for those extra hot days"
0,"I purchased a 25.5 oz. jar of this organic pasta sauce at my local whole foods market.<br />.<br />It contains organic ingredients.  Each 1/2 cup serving is 50 cal., 280 mg sodium, 1 g fat, 10 g carbs, 1 g fiber, 6 g sugar, & 2 g protein.<br /><br />It has a garlic punch that is very pleasant, but it is low on real flavor.<br /><br />It contains chunks of tomatos and bits of garlic.  This is not a thick sauce.<br /><br />It taste much like diet sauces, and it is made from mostly tomato puree (water & tomato psaste).  And that's what it tastes like--water & paste.<br /><br />I give this sauce 1/5 for flavor, 2/5 for texture/thickness, 5/5 for organic integrity, & 5/5 for packaging.<br /><br />This sauce will require you to doctor it up to make it palatable."
1,"My Daughter gets motion sick almost everywhere we go.  The Queasy Pops have really helped her feel better when she has ""that feeling"" coming on.  I just purchased 4 more boxes!"
1,"I'm thrilled with this extract. I ordered it on a Tuesday night and had it by Friday afternoon. It came wrapped nicely in plenty of bubble wrap and tissue paper and was accompanied by a nice little note from the seller thanking me for my order.<br /><br />It smells wonderful. It smells just like cocoa powder, and I use it in all my baked goods and even savory foods. Added to gravy it gives it that little something extra, and it's phenomenal in whipped cream, cookies, brownies, sweetbreads, cakes, even coffee and hot chocolate. It's not a sweet extract so it gives some depth to foods without adding additiona sugar. I will definitely be ordering this in the future and definitely ordering from this merchant again. I am very impressed with the quality and the customer service provided!"
1,"I love chocolate extract, and I'm so happy to have found a source that is cheaper than the outlets I normally buy from.  One warning:  Chocolate Extract only boosts the chocolate notes of products already containing some kind of chocolate or cocoa powder. Used in non chocolate baking, it brings a boost of flavor that may make someone ask ""what is that I'm tasting?"".  They may recognize chocolate, but you don't have to tell them what it is!"
1,"This is a good product, but I didn't taste the chocolate. I use it with plain yogurt and Equal. Still, it has a flavor that's tasty."
1,"I have been looking for a way to make carob powder taste more ""chocolaty"" and this is it. I made a delicious fudge using 1 tablespoon of Star Kay White Chocolate Extract and I couldn't tell it from real chocolate. Delicious fudge but with no caffeine!"
1,Try putting a teaspoon of the Chocolate Extract in your coffee carafe prior to brewing your coffee.  It adds a nice mocha taste.
1,"I use this for making chocolate stout homebrew, and it's the way to go. Cocoa powder mostly adds bitterness, and chocolate malt isn't all that chocolatey. If you really want to make a beer with chocolate flavor, this is your product."
1,I got this because I got a new cookbook for cupcakes. I love it... The flavor is so perfect for red velet cake or brownies I have also used it with a few drops in store bought whip topping is great on pudding for a low fat snack! Highly recommend!
1,I used this product and made the easiest recipe for chocolate liquor.  In a blind taste test the product produced a taste equal to the name brand.  The color is lighter but the taste is the same.
1,"This product is wonderful.  The flavoring it offers is genuine and amazing.  I've used it initially in my cupcakes and everyone loves the flavor!  Thanks!  I would definitely order this product again, I don't plan to be without it in the cupboard!  Makes me want to bake more and more cupcakes to share!"
1,"I love this extract.  Good flavor, not too overpowering.  I use it in proten shakes that need a little extra 'something.'  Will buy it again."
1,This product arrived very promptly and  appropriately packaged.  We used it to make a chocolate<br />liquer.  It worked splendidly!  We couldn't have asked for more.
1,"If this product is what you've been looking for well you found it. Great for anything were adding choc. flavoring will work, including a dark beer, wink! Yes I said beer, but coffee/chili/bbq will work to or how about cake. Good quality and flavor, and worth the money. Order it you'll see (:"
1,"These are the favorite of mine that Bush's makes. I sometimes have trouble getting these at the store. Because they are grabbed up by people right away. So, I guess others like them as well as I do. They have a little more liquid in them than the B&M beans do, but they are still good."
1,"I am very pleased with this pasta. It has good taste and texture, and does particularly well in pasta salads and stir-frys.<br /><br />One caution: the package says to cook for 8 minutes. I find that these gemelli are perfectly al dente after 5 minutes."
1,"My puppy loves these treats! She's allergic to wheat and gluten so it's hard to find treats for her (and ones that she likes). She has naturally dry skin and these definitely help! The omega 3 & 6 fatty acids provide what she needs to keep her coat healthy and shiny. It's great-- they don't contain any wheat, soybean, glutens, bad preservatives, or by-products. Not to mention that the salmon and sweet potatoes in it are known to be easily digestible. She gets so excited when I bring out the bag. Worth the money! Highly recommended!"
0,"I am downgrading from a 5 star to a 1 star because they are made in CHINA. Treats from China have been associated with kidney and liver failure and rare cancers in dogs. Another series of dog deaths from treats from China has been released. There is no oversight. These treats may be OK but I will not take any chances. I am really irritated with Amazon and the vendor for not disclosing the source of the product. They say in the online description, ""read the label carefully"". In very small print the country of origin is disclosed. I do not knowingly feed my dogs anything from China.<br /><br />These are great treat. My dogs love them and they are no artificial stabilizers or fillers. However, at most other on line pet websites they are half the price. Usually Amazon is competitive in pricing but not on this line of products."
1,"The product itself is great, thus my 5 stars. My dogs love these and I think it's helping their dry skin, but ... WOW @ the price! I had no idea the 6-oz. size is the same package I buy at PetsMart for $4.99 - HALF the cost I paid here - and for 3 bags at that! :((((( I had run out, so I didn't have a package to check the size. I thought I'd add these to my Amazon order for convenience, and *assumed* the 6-oz. bag must be considerably larger than the ones I get at PetsMart, given that the price was TWICE - very odd for Amazon, so I never suspected the packages are the same size! People - definitely get these from PetsMart, or check PetsMart or Petco online even - this is WAY OVERPRICED! If I could have rated the price itself, it would have gotten ZERO STARS ~"
1,"My dog (14 year old toy poodle) hates just about every food for dogs.  This is the only treat I've ever found that she never refuses!  The treats are a bit pricey but, for once, they won't go to waste. I do limit the number she eats in a day, as specified on the bag."
1,"My dogs absolutely love these treats - we get them in salmon, duck and chicken.  There is nothing they won't do to get one!  If they are ignoring me outside, all I have to do is shake the bag and they come running...licking their chops on the way!<br /><br />More importantly, the omega is great for their skin and coat - one of my dogs has issues with dry skin/flaking.  As long as I give these to her on a regular basis - her skin is flake free and her coat is absolutely beautiful!<br /><br />It's a win win - my dogs love them and they are good for them!  What more can you ask for from a treat?"
1,"These two-millimeter long treats don't have the pronounced smell of the tuna treats. Like the other Omega treats these are easy to break in half, but are small enough for many dogs to eat in one piece. The shih tzu pair, with their dainty snouts, prefer to have their duck treats torn or cut in two. Since the first ingredient in these Duck treats is duck liver, the girls are becoming treat snobs and act as if they are actually dining on Foie gras. I don't have the heart to tell them anything different.<br />Often the Omega Duck treats are mixed in with several other snacks on the breakfast plates. Always the duck treats are the first to disappear. It's funny to watch Piper push aside the other treats so that she can pick out the pieces of Omega treats. I have some reservations about the treat's country of origin, but the girls love these things and their lip smacking comments have all been positive."
1,"First of all, they stink.  Imagine fish lying around in the sun for a couple of hours.  Yeah, they're that smelly.<br /><br />But that, as it turns out, is why my dogs love them so much.  These treats are so special, in fact, that they're only given out when we want to get our girls into their crates, like at bedtime, or if we're going out or something.  They even know the bag...all I have to do it get it out of the cabinet and they're running off into their crates, waiting happily for their treats.<br /><br />I had read the review from the person who wrote that a fishbone had been found in one.  What I do is bend/break them down the middle before handing them out so I can feel if there's something sharp inside.<br /><br />So the bottom line here is...if my dogs love them, then I love them.  :)"
1,"Not only is this treat good for my dog, but it is great for her coat!  She loves them.  She normally does not do tricks, but will sit, give her paw and do anything you say for those treats."
1,our siberian husky loves these!!! they are a special nighttime treat and she goes crazy when you say it's time for your salmon!!
1,I have some incredibly picky dogs and they love these treats.  The pieces are nice and small.  I reccommend this to even the most finicky of dogs.  My dogs have had no digestive issues with them.
1,"These treats come in Salmon and Duck....my dogs LOVE both. They go crazy when they even see the bag.... Perfect size for a training treat. These treats stay moist...I have the Bear Treats also, they are good too, but more of a dried salmon ""meal"" consistency."
0,I bought these at a local store. I broke up the first one for smaller training treats. My finger was stabbed by a needle shaped fish bone. This bone could have easily perforated my dogs digestive tract and made him very ill or dead. I have contacted the manufacturer and have yet to receive a response.
0,"I opened a bag of this treat a week ago. It was a part of the Christmas present I gave to my 5-month old miniature schnauzer. My pet is crazy over this treat! I would have given this product five stars because my puppy loves it and it's highly nutritious (as claimed by the manufacturer). But I reduced my scoring to two-stars because it makes my puppy pass obnoxious-smelling gas. It doesn't bother him but it does me! When I reviewed the list of ingredients, I found a possible culprit: sweet potato. This is a root crop known to cause flatulence."

But I reduced my scoring to two-stars because it makes my puppy pass obnoxious-smelling gas. It doesn't bother him but it does me! When I reviewed the list of ingredients, I found a possible culprit: sweet potato. This is a root crop known to cause flatulence."

1,"this is a fantastic tasting snack and i had no problem with the seller whatsoever. i first saw this snack in target years ago and started buying alot, finished them all, and never went back to buy more. by the time i did, target stopped selling them and so, i searched for these crackers again and found them here online and at foodtown. this is the perfect snack for people allergic to gluten as i am and a healthy cracker"
1,"These crackers are so good!  I love their cheddar flavor.  They have a nice crunch, and best of all<br />they are gluten free!"
1,"My family loved these crackers.  Gluten free crackers are pretty expensive and we eat a lot of them.  So, having some of our groceries delivered by Amazon is certainly nice!"
1,"These crackers are hard to find in stores, at least where I live. They are salty, but taste very good. They are small, so they would not work too well as a canape base. They would be good for dips, though."
1,"Irish cream teas tend to make me sad. What I've found is that they tend to taste like regular tea with a hint of Irish cream in the background, like you had poured a drop or two into your tea. Which is all well and good, but I drank Irish cream straight up when I was in college, and I want something that tastes like the drink itself. At this point, you're probably wondering if I did anything but drink in college. The answer is....no, not really. Ha! I want an Irish cream tea that I can splash into other teas to make them taste like Irish cream.<br /><br />So I cheated a little with this one. Just a little, I promise! I mixed my spoon of matcha with a few drops of my Irish cream agave before adding the water. I was blown away. It was so, so, so good. It got me through an incredibly long day at work and it kept a smile on my face long after it was gone. It smelled and tasted so strongly of Irish cream that my boss side eyed me a few times until I showed him it was just matcha. And then he was jealous.<br /><br />I love this tea. With the milk allergy issues, Irish cream was one of the things I had to give up and it was with a heavy heart that I did so. This is one of those teas I've been searching and searching for and once again, Red Leaf Tea did it right. I am constantly impressed by them...you'd think by now, I'd just expect their matcha to be amazing. But no, every time I get a new package, I'm floored by the tastiness."
1,"I got this one special for my boyfriend as a surprise. Last time he got to pick out a matcha, we ended up with Cola, so this time I thought an alcoholic drink matcha was in order. More sophisticated? Well - more adult anyways ;)<br /><br />He is loving the flavoured matcha as much (if not more!) than I do! This one smelled sweet from the get go - creamy and .. tangy? Smoky? Not smoky! I'm trying to describe what irish cream smells like - it doesn't have the smokiness of whisky - but it definitely is sweet and creamy! I knew it was going to be a real treat - just like the real thing!<br /><br /> What a neat flavour experience! I prepared the matcha straight and thick for the first bowl. In this state I tasted mostly matcha with an aftertaste of sweet cream that lingered after finishing the bowl. It was very creamy and pleasant.<br /><br />Next I tried it over ice with 18% cream and sugar. I thought my eyes were going to roll into the back of my head and be lost forever! This was mine and Mike's favourite way to enjoy it. It's sweet, but because you have control over the amount of sugar, it's not crazy sweet and cloying. You could probably enjoy cup after cup with the only buzz coming from the energy of all that matcha you're drinking!<br /><br />This one is so so good mixed with the Madagascar Vanilla matcha - it just adds a bit of something that takes the creamy flavour over the top. Come St. Patricks day, it would be an awesome drink to mix with mint matcha (Mint is on the way in the mail as we speak!) and hey - it's already green! No need to add any food colouring for your Paddy experience ;)<br /><br />Now - if a Guinness Matcha ever comes out - I know the perfect one to mix it with ;)"
1,"I love hot sauces and this is one of the best.  It has a touch of sweetness, a lot of fire, and is great on all sorts of food, from oriental to grilled meats."
1,"these are great tasting candies, even if they were not sugar free! sure beats the typical mints, or other artificial tasting fruit flavors!"
1,A great flavorful hard candy that provides all natural ingredients that helps curb hunger while keeping your breath fresh and your mouth moist. Just delicious as a treat.
1,"Same great carbonation as always from kristian regale. Red raspberry color, but almost with a touch of orange, and smells very different from any other juice I've had, must be the lingonberry, and I can get just a touch of the apple, a bit of a tart smell. A bit of a musky, dusty rose scent. It's a bit more strongly carbonated on the tongue, the fizz completely evaporates. Only a hit of the apple gets through the very powerful lingonberry. As typical, it's not as sweet as most juices, but also has a slightly bitter finish, and medium acidity. It had some noticeable dregs at the end.<br /><br />As for paring I'd drink it with something that you'd normally have with a fruity drink, maybe mexican food like fajitas or burritos.<br /><br />Did I Like it: Not as much as Kristian Reg&aacute;le's Pomegranate offering, but it's still a unique drink worth trying."
1,"As a non-drinker, I have had lots of non-alcoholic beverages.  There is something classy and smooth about this one.  Tiny bubbles seems more akin to champagne rather than large bubbles in the others that is more akin to soda pop.  The ligonberry-apple really makes it special and holiday-like."
1,Adds great flavor to any dish where vinegar is used. My local store does not carry it anymore. I decided to get it here because it is so much more enjoyable than the brands in my local store. The product was shipped in a way that there was no possibility of breakage.
1,"I've been drinking this for several months, and every 5 lb. bag has been consistently great. I use it with a Capresso Coffee-TEC (drip) and a Jura-Capresso ENA4 (espresso). This coffee is a great example of how decaf doesn't require a trade-off in flavor. Highly recommended."
1,"I am very happy with this coffee.  I used to have a very expensive Starbucks habit, combined with a heavy sugar habit.  While trying to reduce the sugar in my life, I have discovered that I don't like Starbucks without all of the added sugar to tone down the bitterness.  This decaf is much smoother and tastier to me.  I brew a strong cup, and this worked very nicely in my french press.  Even without sugar, I'm enjoying it very much."
1,"This has become our ""go to"" decaf coffee.  It mixes well with regular coffees for a reduced caffeine blend and it is excellent on it's own as an accompaniment to an evening dessert.  The low acidity of the coffee helps to prevent the indigestion you can get from other coffees, especially when they accompany a rich dessert.  While this is billed as a dark roast, it's more like a medium dark roast.  While it isn't super flavorful, it is very good for a decaf.  The price of all coffee has increased recently but the price of this coffee is fairly reasonable when purchased in the 5-pound bags."
1,This is best decaf I had from Coffee Bean Direct.  It is very hearty for a decaf which is what both my wife and I like.  I always buy the 5 lb bag and keep the part I'm not using in the frig.  Will continue to buy.
1,"I got some of this from a low sodium foods website. I can't believe how much flavor this has for only 170mg per oz.  I am on a strict low sodium diet and I don't like foods where they have simply left out salt (bland) or they cheat and add potassium chloride, something just as bad as salt to my diet. So I am constantly on the hunt for low sodium foods that are naturally that way. This is a perfect cure for my salty food cravings. I haven't tried the other flavors yet but I plan to."
1,"I wanted to feed my chickens, turkeys and goats just a little extra protein to keep them fit and healthy while the goats are pregnant over the winter and the chickens and turkeys are getting ready for breeding season.  Sprouts seemed like a good idea but everytime I tried to sprout regular beans they would go bad before the sprouts were big enough to interest the poultry.  So I saw that the ones I was eating out of can were grown from mung beans.  Never heard of them before but thought I'd give it a try.  The beans took longer to get here than I would have liked (almost two weeks) but that just tells me the time frame I need before I order more.  And the beans!!!!  Oh my goodness, you'll get 100% germination and sprouts that are easily eaten and really quite yummy in just three days.  I need to get a bigger growing apparatus so that I can make more at one time.  The chickens, turkeys, goats and even my pregnant cow LOVE the sprouts.  I've found the extra source of protein I needed.  Thanks so much."
0,The packaging was great - flavor definately not the same as it used to be.
1,"This was my favorite as a child. I would put one in my mouth and let it disolve.<br />Ghiradelli stopped making them when their packaging machine was broken when then moved from San Francisco to San Leandro (about 15 years ago). Rather than repair or rebuild it they just stopped making them. Despite years of protests from candy lovers. Now a new company is making them.<br />If you never had them before you may think ""so what?"" But if you grew up with them and miss them you will be thrilled."
1,"Flicks used to be my favorite candy until they were discontinued by Ghiradelli way back when.  I'm so glad they're back.  They're like bigger hershey kisses, but the chocolate is better.  The cardboard tube (assuming they still come in them) also smells great after the candy is gone.  A childhood favorite!"
1,Good. Brings back the old times from the 1970's. The only problem is that the wafers are thinner and slightly harder than what I remember. It isn't the same. But it is as close as I can get. The idea of chocolate drops with the swirl on top in a colorful foil cardboard tube still brings back some nice memories.
1,"Reminds me of the ALEX theater back in Glendale, CA.<br /><br />Very chocolate, very good, mmm"
0,I tried the new product but its not the same as when Ghiradelli made it.  Very disappointed.  They shouldn't bring a old time product back unless they can duplicate the exact taste/recipe.
0,"They are now made by a different company, TJerrild, located in Fresno, CA. They definitely do not taste the same as Ghiradelli. Supposedly they are made with the same ingredients, but I would say not the same recipe. A huge difference in taste form when I was a kid. Thanks for the memories Ghiradelli...."
1,"I remember when I was younger, I couldn't go to the movie theatre without buying a package of Flicks (sometimes two)! They are so rich and creamy with that wafery taste. I can still remember the flavor like it was yesterday and can't wait to get them again! Yummmmmm!!!"
1,"I just got back from a trip to England where I had the most wonderful homemade tomato soup at a tearoom in Ashburton, Devon.  I thought I would never find anything to equal this homemade soup. I bought a can of Amy's Organic Chunky Tomato Bisque and one sip of this heavenly soup and I knew I had found something just as good if not better than the homemade soup in Devon, England.  I have now been adding some fresh Basil to this awesome soup!!!.  I hope that Amy's never changes their recipe for this excellent fresh tasting soup."
1,"Was craving grilled cheese and tomato soup and came across this at the supermarket. Delicious. I added a little salt and black pepper but otherwise this soup is awesome. Chunky tomatoes really make this soup a winner. I came to Amazon hoping to get more but at $2.88 a can, might as well get it in store. I paid $2.69."
1,"This is as good as any restaurant, home made, or specialty shop tomato soup. You won't believe it comes from a can. It's delicious -- chunky, slightly sweet, and hearty. I highly recommend it."
1,"This is the BEST tomato soup!!  It has small chunks of tomato in which give it such a homemade flair to it.  The taste is pure tomato and has a very smooth, velvety feel to it.  I just read all the other ideas people have shared using it.... I am ready to try some new things ;-)"
1,"This is the best canned tomato soup on the market bar none!  Best of all, it's organic!"
0,"Though the texture is hearty and thick, this soup tastes way too sweet for me. Is it really necessary to add 14g of evaporated cane juice to a soup?"
1,"My favorite winter meal has always been a grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup.  Like most folks, I grew up eating Campbells, but after trying Amy's tomato bisque, I can tell you that this is in another league!  It's delicious and is my new favorite soup, and I now keep at least a case on hand at all times when it's cold outside."
1,"Last week, ""The Hungry Girl"" (from the Food Network) was on Good Morning America and claimed this was ""The best soup ever! Ever! Ever!"". I am not a big fan of Campbell's Tomato soup, but have enjoyed the various Progresso Tomato soups. I had to try this.<br /><br />It was fantastic.<br /><br />I see one of the other reviews mentioned using it as a pasta sauce. I can definitely see that.<br /><br />One thing that surprised me is that the low sodium version of the soup has a couple of negative reviews about it being too sweet. But it has the same amount of sugar in it, so I wonder if the lower salt content makes the sweetness stand out more?"
1,"This is by far the only tomato soup one should ever eat - sorry campbells! I also throw a can of this into my vegetable soup - also a great base for any bisques  - throw in some corn, diced potatoe & shrimp or any shellfish  its amazing"
1,"Can't believe it came from a can.  Made me a lover of tomato soup, of this brand anyway.  Much lower in sodium than Campbells."
1,I ordered this soup because Campbell's Tomato Bisque price had gone up and I was able to get free shipping on Amy's.  Wow! This soup is much better than the Campbells.  The texture is thick and it is quite flavorful; it is the best tomato bisque I have experienced. I will definitely purchase Amy's again.
1,"This seriously is the best soup I have EVER tasted (well out of a can at least). I recently moved to a small town, and none of the local grocery stores carry it. It is so amazing that I have to order it online. I just can't live without it!"
1,"I like tomato soup but Campbell's reminds me of a giant bowl of ketchup - this is much better, better ingredients, good quick go to lunch with some whole grain crackers."
1,"This is absolutely delicious and I don't think I could make a better-tasting, more-affordable soup like this at home. I added some broken up angel hair pasta (organic, of course) to this and heated it on the stove with some chili flakes. It tastes like grown up SpaghettiO's. Divine!"
1,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G176B4"">Amy's Organic Chunky Tomato Bisque, 14.5-Ounces (Pack of 12)</a>This is the best Tomato Soup I have tasted.  My grandson, age 2, loves it too!  The best part is that it is organic!"
1,"This soup tastes like my homemade tomato bisque, I am soooo happy to have found this! I want to eat it every single day."
1,"I can't believe I got so excited over a soup, but I just LOVE this!  I have never been to Italy, but when I tasted this soup, I imagined I was there, being served a plate of pasta with a fresh-tasting sauce.  Condensed a bit, this would be a great sauce with noodles or meatballs.  As is, it is a delicious soup.  Try it!"
1,It's hard to find a vegetarian tomato soup that isn't bland. This was delicious and even had little chunks of tomato in it.
1,"This is pricey but hard-to-find these days.  It used to be possible to buy inexpensive edible gold and silver leaf (vark) in Indian groceries, but there seem to be problems nowadays with importing it.  So I was very happy to find this on Amazon.  Great for making a big impression by gilding a whole cake!  It's not hard and you don't need too many leaves.  Just carefully slide them off the paper leaves onto the cake, then smooth using a brush (a cosmetic type brush works well).  It won't be perfectly smooth, but good enough, and it'll wow whomever you're serving the cake to!  They're not likely to have seen something like this before.  Obviously this would be great for a golden wedding anniversary cake!!!"
1,"We are very pleased with the edible 23 karat gold leaf. Our holiday fruitcakes are dazzling, you can see some pictures at[...]. The items arrived on time and were very carefully packaged.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0060SY5EI"">Gold 2 lb Fruitcake Dark</a> is one of our products that turned out great with the gold."
1,"This is an awesome product.  It adds such a beautiful touch of class & elegance to my dessert presentation, I just love it.  Fast shipping & great customer service.  This is my go-to for gold leaf !"
1,"These little things are gems. They store heat from your ""too hot"" coffee and release it later. Really perform great in an insulated mug adding hours to my coffee's drink ability.<br /><br />They are not:<br />-Ice cubes<br />-A miracle<br /><br />Best used with:<br />-Insulated coffee mug<br />-With a cover<br /><br />I use three in an older Thermos insulated coffee mug and my coffee stays hot for about 5 hours and still is warm enough to enjoy for a few hours after that. Before Joulies my coffee was too hot then just right and then cold after about two hours.<br /><br />Main point:<br />The coffee stays at about 140 degrees for hours so it can be enjoyed. Expanding the window of comfortably hot drinking temperature."
1,"I first purchased Joulies when they got their start on Kickstarter.  Since I purchased them I have used them almost every day in my coffee on my way to work.  I use them in a Thermos vacuum mug (in my opinion the best way to use them).<br /><br />Before I had Joulies, I would pour my hot coffee into my mug before I left and have to wait for about half an hour to actually drink my coffee.  This is because the mug does such a good job of retaining the heat in the coffee.<br /><br />When I use Joulies, my coffee is ready to drink in about 5 minutes.  The excess heat gets absorbed by the Joulies as the material inside changes phase from solid to liquid.  This heat is then released back into the coffee as the material goes from liquid to solid, so the coffee stays hot for a lot longer (this doesn't benefit me very much, because I drink my coffee pretty fast).<br /><br />I have tried using them in a regular coffee mug, and while it got cooler a little faster, it didn't stay hot for very long because so much heat is lost to the environment.  I wouldn't recommend using them this way unless you really need your coffee one minute faster.<br /><br />So far they have been really durable, I've dropped them a few times and shake them in my mug to circulate the coffee.  They have gotten a little scratched, but it is no different from well used silverware.<br /><br />I have purchased a couple sets as gifts for the coffee lovers I know, and they have been well received.  Perfect thing to get for someone who has everything and can appreciate the nice bit of thermodynamics that Joulies demonstrate."
1,"Love this product!  If I am completely honest, the first couple times I used them I wasn't sure if they worked the way I expected.  Then I noticed such a big difference when I didn't use them that I became a believer and now use them every time I drink coffee.<br /><br />Depending on the type of cup you use, you get different results.  The one thing that stays consistent is that the coffee becomes drinkable (hot, but not scalding) within a couple of minutes.  I use cream in my coffee, so in a coffee cup I will usually use 2 joulies and with my travel mug I use 3 joulies.  The general rule I have come up with is it increases drinking time to about 2 or 2 1/2 times the original time.  For example, in my open, no cover coffee cup, my coffee stays hot about 20-30 minutes and in my poorly insulated travel mug with cover, my coffee stays hot about an hour and a half rather than 30-45 minutes.  I just recently bought an insulated mug and am very excited to use the joulies with it, because I know I am going to have perfect temperature coffee for hours (much longer than my coffee usually lasts).<br /><br />This is a product I would recommend to any coffee drinker, as long as they know the type of cup you use does make a difference in the results you are going to get!  If you follow the guidelines provided with the product (pre-heating, using an insulated mug with cover, and experimenting with the number of joulies) you will find the combination that works for you."
1,"I have fallen in love with Coffee Joulies. I backed them when they were on Kickstarter and waited months for them to arrive. But since they came I have used them every day. They really do work at cooling your hot beverage down and keeping it at that optimal drinking temperature for longer. However your experience can vary wildly if you do not use them correctly. There is no golden rule as how to use them, you just have to figure that out for your own tastes and your drinking mug.<br /><br />Here are a couple of key things that you need to think about in the order of most importance:<br />*How much beverage you have<br />*How well your beverage container insulates<br />*How hot your drink is at the start<br />*How hot you like your drink<br />*How long before you drink it<br /><br />Let me explain a little bit. The more drink you have to cool, the more joulies you want to use. The better you container is at insulating, the better the effects of the joulies are. The hotter your drink is at the start, the more joulies you need to cool it down and the longer it will stay warm. If you like your drink cooler, use more joulies. If you like your drink still pretty hot, use less joulies or you can preheat your jouies with hot water before putting them in your beverage. If you are drinking really soon, make sure to use more joulies.<br /><br />The size of the joulies has been a complaint I have heard before. But really the amount of space they take up is very surprisingly negligible. If it bothers you, buy a bigger mug or drink less. I have heard people say that they do not work that well, if this is a problem for you get a better insulating mug. When I use these in a standard coffee mug it is usually hard to tell that there is any effect from the joulies. Also try stirring your beverage with the joulies in the mug, this help the joulies absorb heat better and release heat better when they need to. Some people worry that they will fall and hit your mouth when you try to drink the last bit of liquid. Don't be worried this does not happen, I thought it would at first too.<br /><br />Here is my method for making tea with joulies and it has really worked well for me. I have a Contigo 16oz mug for tea. It is great at keeping tea hot (5hrs+) but it takes forever to be able to drink it (1hr). With the coffee joulies I add 3 in, at room temperature before brewing my tea. I add my tea and hot water into the same mug and brew for 3 minutes with the lid on. Take out the tea, add some sugar and milk, and close the lid. I give the mug a few shakes to stir things up. Now in just about 5 minutes after the tea is brewed I can sip it (it used to take an hour for this). I can drink it comfortably in just about 15-20 minutes and it will stay hot at the perfect temperature for about 3 hours. I rinse my joulies between drinks and wash them every week or so.<br /><br />I love this product and would gladly buy it again. The price is a bit high, but they really will last you a long time with good care. They make great gifts and are really a conversation starter."
1,"Just started using my Joulies and could not be more impressed!!!  I went to Dunkin Donuts, put 4 Joulies in my insulated mug and bought a medium with cream.  In 2 minutes the coffee was perfect temperature and good to the last drop!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
0,"This was my first kickstarter contribution, and now I'm skeptical of ever doing another! These coffee joulies simply don't work, and they take up all the room in a cup."
0,"NOTE:  This product probably works best if you are going to put them in a thermos, but it doesn't work that well if just placed in a coffee cup.<br /><br />I purchased these back when it was a kickstarter campaign.<br /><br />I'm the type of person who likes a hot cup of coffee and I tend to sip slowly so I find myself going to the microwave to heat up my cup all the time.  I thought this would be the perfect solution.<br /><br />I did follow instructions to warm them up first.  I would pour boiling water over them for 4 minutes while my press-pot coffee brewed. I would then pour out the water from the cup and pour my coffee onto the now-hot Joulies.<br /><br />For me, there was absolutely no noticeable difference in how fast my coffee got cold - so I'd have to go through the extra step of pouring the coffee into a different cup so I could microwave it as the Joulies can't be microwaved.  What a Pain.<br /><br />I tried them every day for a week to make sure I wasn't doing something wrong and then put them in a drawer someplace where unused kitchen gadgets go to die.<br /><br />I tried them in a thermos a few times and they seems to work ok (thus the 2 stars) but I don't really use a thermos all that often.  So, for my purposes (keeping a cup of coffee hot) they did absolutely nothing."
0,"My husband was really excited about these things. He read about them in a magazine over a year ago before they were available for purchase, and decided to buy them for me as a gift (now that they're available), to replace the two ice cubes I dump in my coffee every morning to make it ""chuggable"". Um, I'm not impressed. My coffee remained too hot to drink initially (just as it would be WITHOUT them in it), and was cold within one hour (again, JUST like it would be WITHOUT them in it). In fact, the only thing different about my coffee with these little Joulies in it is there was a LOT less room in my cup for actual coffee because they're quite large and you need several in your cup. Maybe they're more geared for those who enjoy their coffee in travel mugs? And because I cannot speak to this I thought one star would be inappropriate.<br /><br />I will of course lie and tell my husband they're miraculous and wonderful. But secretly I wish he'd saved the $50 because my ice cubes have been working just fine for years and are what I'll continue to use when he's not around.<br /><br />**Update**<br />I just realized these things cost him $60 and decided to return them!"
0,"I had such high hopes for this product, but alas no matter how I tried I could not get this product to keep my coffee hot. If I can't return them, at least they look nice and I can use for decoration."
0,I brought this for my husband and he said that it did not work at all and he tried it both of the ways that it said to now trying to return it and find that it is not that easy to return things will remember that when I think about ordering on here again
1,"Haci Bekir is THE company that makes the best Turkish Delight.  I went to the store when I visited Istanbul a couple of years back and have been yearning for this treats ever since.  I tried the other brands, but they're just not the same.  It's a rarity to find this brand in the US (store or online), but I found it on Amazon!  Eating this pistachio turkish delight treats brings back memories of the best candies I've had in my life.  Thank you!"
1,"Got this as a gift for my dad's birthday because he likes pistachios.  He liked it... and mom did too!  Now I'm planning to get him two boxes for Father's Day so he can enjoy a whole box even if mom *is* 'helping'.<br /><br />We'd never had Turkish Delight before, and this seemed like a good one to try, based on the earlier review.  These are chewy but not sticky, sweet but not overly so, and have a nice overall flavor.  I'd recommend this as a gift again! Dad really liked it, and it was something he'd never tried."
1,These were easily the best Turkish Delight that I have ever had. You must try them!! I have tried many others and these have big pieces of nuts and aren't too sweet.
0,"My local Walmart and Target both have this, ground or whole bean, at a regular price of less than $9 per 12 oz. bag. It's WAY overpriced here.<br /><br />It is an excellent coffee - I'm drinking it as I write this: an interesting hint of woody, creamy, citrusy taste that's dark but without the burnt aftertaste that comes with many dark roasts."
1,"Excellent pasta. Great flavor and texture. Rough surface holds the sauce. Perfect texture somewhere between North Italian fresh pasta and the ""al dente"" hard Semolina quality of South Italy. But where's the Rigatoni and the Penne. And the Pennoni. This is crime against civilization that Amazon has run out. I would buy the 20 pack case. Please bring it back. Subito!"
1,"All you need is the meatballs and you have the best meal going.  Can't beat ""Lensi"" pasta!  True meaning of ""Al dante"" pasta:)"
1,"Delicious! It's like a Nutty Bar, but with less guilt. And not too sweet! I was worried the peanuts butter would taste fake, but it was great."
1,"This bar taste's great, and is much lower in calories, carbs, etc., than an actual candy bar. I would definitely buy these again. They are healthier and better for you, along with satisfying your hunger for something sweet or chocolaty."
1,"If you love peanutbutter and chocolate, you will love these bars! They are like Nutty Bars, but without all the calories!"
1,"Skinny cow does it again, with a yummy wafer cookie with peanut butter and covered in chocolate.  Does it taste low cal?  Heck no, and does it fit the bill when you want a sweet treat that is nicely portioned and you can let go of the guilt and calories of a regular candy bar?  Yep, this one does it for me.  I've purchased them and have put them in my husband's gym bag and my purse when we are out on the road and just need a little something.  This one has it all, great taste, good proportion and a not so guilty treat.  Overall, love it!~"
1,"The oil itself is excellent and the lemon flavor is just right--stronger than the stuff that you might get in a local grocer's, at least here in Texas--but it doesn't have a processed, chemical taste.<br /><br />I find that using it as the only oil in a vinaigrette is too strong, and so you needn't go to the expense, but if it comprises a fourth to a half of the oil, and if the other oil is good, the balance is quite nice. In fact, if the acid in the vinaigrette is a good sherry vinegar, the flavor of the lemon in the oil is more noticeable than the vinegar."
1,Agrumato oil pressed with lemons is superb on salads and in cooking. The lemon flavor is not overwhelming but adds a freshness that is surprising. You can use it in most recipes that call for EVOO. Try it in untraditional ways and you'll find you love it.
1,This olive oil is sublime. The lemon flavor and scent is not too over-powering. I'm looking forward to finding all kinds of reasons to use it!
1,"This is by far the best olive oil infused with pressed lemons that I have ever tried. For a really spectacular salad dressing that is sure to win rave reviews mix together Agrumento Extra Virgin Olive Oil with Pressed Lemons and ""Marukan"" brand seasoned gourmet Rice Vinegar Lite in approximate equal amounts (or a little more of the rice vinegar depending on taste). If desired add a little salt and pepper and wisk all together until blended. This is so easy, but so delicious! Enjoy!"
1,"This is tasty satisfying all natural honey candy. While that is fine in and of itself, if you have interstitial cystitis and are avoiding citric acid this is the only candy that I have found so far without citric acid or corn syrup which I am also avoiding."
1,"For anyone who likes the flavor of honey, and eats honey on certain foods, you are gonna love this.  I bought some while on my honeymoon at Red River, NM.  I'm usually really leery about trying new foods but this I had to try it.  The minute I tasted it, I thought I was actually eating honey. The flavor lasted until the piece was completely gone.  Makes a sore throat feel a bit better."
1,"I love these little candies! They are great for a sore throat or a sweets craving. I got my first bag at Whole Foods, but I would definitely order them in bulk next time! :)"
1,"CAN NO LONGER FIND PRODUCT LOCALLY, FOUND ON LINE, REASONABLE PRICE AND QUICK SHIPMENT. WILL BUY AGAIN."
1,My dogs are digging this flavor as they do all of Merrick's dry dog food products.<br /><br />Fast shipping from this seller made the purchase even better!<br /><br />Thank you!
1,"I used AvoDerm products when my Basenji, Emmy, was alive.  She thrived on the dog food and dog bone treats.  Her coat was shiny and soft while eating both the can and dry food.  She passed away of old age.  My daughter has a Boxer with digestive issues.  After introducing Rocky, the Boxer, to AvoDerm his problems disappeared.  Buying the food online is a cost savings compared to Petco and PetsMart high prices.  Thank you, Amazon!"
1,"Maybe it has changed, but it's exactly as the Amazon.com description I  read. It's Montreal Smoked Meat, presliced and in packets. It's not pastrami. If you want pastrami, buy pastrami. It's Montreal Smoked Meat and perfect as such."
1,"this is what smoked meat in montreal tastes like - it's nor pastrami or corned beef. it comes in 5 packets so it stays fresh. all the information is in the description so i'm not sure what the confusion is. if you're looking for really good montreal smoked meat, here it is."
1,"Before I post my review, I'll state the following:<br /><br />I've never been to Montreal so I can't compare this to the meat found in an actual Montreal, Quebec deli.<br /><br />This product is from the USA, but at least according to wikipedia it's from an area of the USA that does produce a ""true"" Montreal beef brisket, although the article also implies that some feel that only brisket from Montreal is the ""true"" Montreal beef brisket.<br /><br />Give the two items above, I found this product to be excellent.  Smokey without being overpowering, tender and quite fresh despite being sliced and then vacuum sealed.  The pepper along the edges of each slice add a bit as well, but again it's far from overpowering.  This works well, cold or warm as a sandwich meat, or heated as sliced meat on a plate.<br /><br />Product shipped very fast, and was well packaged.  Despite my getting home late and thus the package sitting for nearly 2 hours (I'm single and I couldn't arrange for someone to pick it up for me) it was still quite cold, being packaged in (if memory serves) a styrofoam box with ""blue ice"" (not the actual brand, but something similar, a gelled ""ice"" that is at least in theory reusuable).  As currently advertised as of June 2012, it was in (again if memory serves) individual one pound packages and again both pre-sliced and fully cooked.  Fat content is fine in my opinion, although I haven't tried making an au-jus with it like apparently one reviewer did when he possibly mistook this for pastrami (he doesn't mention au-jus, but does mention a ""pastrami dip"").  The one time I did reheat it though, I didn't see enough ""drippings"" to make anything like an au-jus.<br /><br />Anyway, when I do run out I'm going to consider this product again.  It's of fine quality and is shipped very well."
1,"I purchased this product as a birthday gift for a Canadian expat. Communication with the seller was very easy and the replies to my questions were prompt. The meat was shipped via 2-day air to get to us cold and fresh, and it was packed in a cooler with gel ice packs.<br /><br />It's just splendid meat. Not too fatty, perfect for sandwiches. The flavor is very smoky and delicious, and the person it was purchased for said that the taste was spot-on for what was remembered from buying this same product in Canada proper.<br /><br />The amount of meat for the price is very reasonable.<br /><br />We'll be shopping from this seller again."
0,"It tasts fine... But I was expecting a 3 1/2 lb. beef brisket...instead i got five packs of shaved smoked beef. Not bad mind you, but the description clearly leads one to expect a WHOLE beef brisket... I can get sliced meat at the local deli... I was expecting much more.<br /><br />James Hatsis"
1,"Our dogs simply love these. They can even double as pill pockets if the pill isn't too big. I have never found a good replacement for them since moving away from the PetCo that carried them, which is why I'm not ordering them off of Amazon. It would be easier to pick up a different treat when we go grocery shopping, but they ALL have high fructcose corn syrup listed as the first couple of ingredients. Here are the Bil Jac ingredients:<br /><br />Chicken Liver, Chicken, Chicken By-Product Meal, Wheat Flour, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Phosphoric Acid, Salt, Potassium Sorbate and Citric Acid and BHA and Calcium Propionate (Preservatives), Iron Oxide.<br /><br />Notice the first three ingredients are all CHICKEN."
1,These are the best for keeping your dog happy!  And they really help emphasize tasks completed well!
1,"I bought these as a gift for a friend's dogs after one had surgery. I previously had wrapped these up at Christmas for my dogs and put under the tree ... but only for one year. They could smell them and chewed up the carton to get to them while i was out! I couldn't be mad, i should have known better. Anyway, these are great treats."
0,"My dogs love these treats, and I do buy them occasionally because they are cheap and perched at the check-out counter of our local garden/feed store. But check out the ingredient list-- I don't think anyone can feel good about feeding their dog high-fructose corn syrup! Just not the healthiest option-- when so many of our dogs are overweight, it seems better to feed them a real liver treat, versus this product which is ""made with liver"".<br /><br />My dogs absolutely love <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000255OIG"">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried 14 Ounce</a> (the larger size packages are more economical). I just feel a lot better about feeding real freeze-dried liver that doesn't have all the extra junk in Bil-Jac liver treats.<br /><br />Specifically, these treats have chicken ""by-products""-- that means liquid slaughterhouse run-off and other non-human grade leftovers from the slaughterhouse. UGH! Bil-Jac also includes three preservatives, glycerin (?!), and the corn syrup.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the ingredient list for Bil-Jac liver treats, so you can make your own decision:<br /><br />Liver, Chicken By-Products, Chicken By-Product Meal, Corn, Chicken Fat, Glycerin, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Propylene Glycol, Wheat Flour, Phosphoric Acid, Salt, Sodium Propionate and Potassium Sorbate and BHA and Citric Acid (Preservatives), Iron Oxide."
1,"Hmmmm. I read somewhere that a little dark chocolate is now good for you. Well, I was passing the desert isle in my nearby Fresh and Easy Market and there were some Gamesa Sugar Wafers. I had tried the Vanilla ones and then felt guilty afterwards. The were sure good. Imported from Mexico. But today, there were also some Chocolate Sugar Wafers next to the vanilla ones. How could I resist? Especially after reading about the benefits of a little chocolate in your diet. Into the cart a 6.7-ounce packet went. Mmmm. They're good. Nice and fresh and tasty. Now the trick will be to keep the amount down.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
0,"Bought these for a party...guest of honor's favorite cookie!  EVERY COOKIE IN ALL 4<br />PACKAGES WERE BROKEN!!!!!  So if you wanted to put out nicely...forget it. Just  thrown in the box.<br />Fresh, but broken to pieces! I ended up using them for a pie crust!!!"
1,"The Mint Milano cookies are wonderful. They have a light and crispy texture with a mild mint chocolate taste. The flavor reminds me a lot of the chocolate mint Girl Scout cookies although the texture of the 2 cookies are very different (the girl scout cookie is much denser).<br /><br />Unfortunately the cookies usually arrive with very few intact and several of mine were even broken into multiple pieces. They still taste pretty good though.<br /><br />Nutritional Facts copied from the actual package (July 2011):<br /><br />Serving size 2 cookies (25g/ 0.9oz)<br /><br />Servings per container about 8<br /><br />Calories per serving 130<br /><br />Calories from fat 70<br /><br />Total Fat 7g<br /><br />Saturated Fat 5g<br /><br />Trans Fat 0g<br /><br />Cholesterol less than 5 mg<br /><br />Sodium 65mg<br /><br />Total Carbohydrate 16g<br /><br />Dietary Fiber less than 1g<br /><br />Sugars 8g<br /><br />Protein 1g<br /><br />Vitamins A and C 0%<br /><br />Calcium 0%<br /><br />Iron 4%<br /><br />FYI, I purchased my cookies during 100 degree weather and except for some of the chocolate melting onto the inner wrapper the cookies were fine (I used 2 day shipping which might make a difference since the cookies weren't in the heat that long).<br /><br />At 15.88 for 4 bags of cookies the price per bag is 3.97 which is 48 cents more than the price printed on the cookie bag (3.49)."
1,"These are our favorite kind of cookies! Usually, I just buy the dark chocolate one, but Pepperidge has so many different types, I recently decided to try the others. The mint adds a refreshing hint to the chocolate, which we like. These are nice to enjoy with tea as a midafternoon snack or something of the sort."
1,"All of the flavors I've tried are great; but my favorite are the mint.<br /><br />I was concerned re the shipping issue based on other reviews.  When they arrived, the cookies were packed so tightly into a box filled with canned goods that the outer carton was pushed out of shape right on top of where the cookies were - which carton was pretty battered on that location, as one might expect from an incorrectly packed carton.  Amazon, what is up with your packaging logic?  It's so weird what you do when packing things....<br /><br />Anyway, I figured the whole batch of cookies would be crushed.  To my amazement, only 3 of the cookies were broken (out of a pack of 4 bags).  I think that was a fluke really.  Anyway, otherwise they were fresh etc.  The only other odd thing was that these seemed to be different cookies than what I was used to.  They seemed to be thinner.  I've noticed since moving from the West Coast to the East Coast that a lot of products seem different here in various ways, so I figured it was either that, or maybe I was imagining it; but I don't think so.  Anyway - I actually preferred the thinner ones, as the overall flavor balances were better and the texture was more appealing.<br /><br />So while my shipping story was a success, I can't claim that the product was really properly packaged, and I wouldn't therefore want to leave a review claiming that."
1,"This review is regarding the cookie, not the price set by this seller. The cookie.... is fantastic. What a perfect little treat. Three cookies are only 180 calories. Since I am trying to watch my weight, I eat one - only 60 calories!! It's perfect for those times you NEED something sugary or chocolately. You can eat one of these and not blow your entire day dieting.<br /><br />Yum. Yum."
1,"These cookies hardly need a review. They are so amazingly delicious. The perfect amount of rich chocolate between the cookies. Pepperidge farm sure did it right with these cookies. Stick to the classic ones, though. I've tried a few other variations and they aren't nearly as good."
1,"The cookies were delicious, chrisp and whole. I can only say they did not last long.  Pepperidge Farm Mint Milano is the only cookie I realy enjoy and would eat a lot off.  The others, even in Peppridge Farm I would only eat one or two.  But I have found that the Mint Milano is hard to get.  Pepperidge Farm should try selling in Canada and Jamaica,  West Indies.  I actually live in Jamaica, W.I. and can not get Mint Milano there so I either ask friends to buy it for me or buy it on line.  Would recommend this cookie for all those people that like a lite combination of mint and chocolate."
1,"These have minty chocolate in them, but it's not too minty, wich is good.  They're a lot like the Thin Mint Girl Scout cookies in reguard to flavor, but the texture is lighter and crisper."
0,"I LOVE raspberry, and Pepperidge Farms, so I thought this would be a ""no brainer"".  However, when I received them they were already a week past the freshness date, and they were very dry.  I don't think I will order again."
1,By the time I buy a few four packs and get amazons free shipping to my door it is a better deal than my local store.Its a wonderful crispie cookie that holds up well in shipping Try it for yourselves  :)
0,"We've tried a lot of Progresso soups lately, and this is one of the few I've been disappointed in. Normally even their light soups are well seasoned and thus have a strong, good flavor. That was not the case with this soup. It was just kind of blah tasting. It also had very little chicken in it. It did have their big twisted noodles, which I'm also not a fan of. They tend to be tough and irritating. It is only 70 calories a serving, which is its only real plus. However, a lot of other Progresso soups are in a good calorie range and also a delight to eat. Try one of them instead."
1,"Finally: candy that is good for your teeth. My kids love it. Nice to have a variety of flavors in a single container. And with the amount in the package, it lasts a long time.<br />In the car for misc diversions."
1,"We first tried this Olive Oil in a high-end restaurant, and fell in love with it. It is subtle and smooth. It's less picante and more clear flavors. We dip bread in the oil, or spread over an argula pizza. Highly recommend this for anyone."
0,"I like the other reviewer bought this from World Market, and it is DISGUSTING. I chucked it and the other boxes I had bought straight in the trash."
0,"First and foremost I will say that I was sorely disappointed with this item.  I purchased mine at World Market where I have previously had great success with another brand that they sadly no longer carry.  That previous brand was real tabouli.  This one was not.  Tabouli is made with Bulgar wheat.  This is couscous.  The packaging is very misleading.<br /><br />I only give this two stars because the finished product was edible, but not flavorful.  Moreover, in trying to follow the instructions for preparation, the first instruction says simply, ""empty package contents into bowl and add an equal amount of water.""  I tried to eyeball it and was able to come out with a decent guess at 1 1/2 cups.  Regardless, one shouldn't have to guess.  I will not buy this again."
1,"Real Food Toppers is truly a quality product with an extremely small amount of hard, unusable pieces. I am pleased with this purchase and so are my cats. I will continue buying this product for my finicky kitties. Thanks for money well spent."
1,"The best micro popcorn by far.  Totally unhealthy, what with that buttery packet and all, but worth every bite!  As close to movies theater popcorn as you can get without leaving your house."
0,"Makes you so sick, stomach hurts, stay away!!!!<br /><br />Not worth the cheap buy. Just go to the grocery store and pay a little more for good mixes.<br /><br />Or go with brand name brands instead"
1,My dogs eat nothing but Halo brand dog food because it has all REAL ingredients and they love it!  The treats and chews are just icing on the cake for them.  It's their favorite!  I know they love it and that it's good for them so I can feel good about feeding them Halo!
1,I was given a couple of these as a gift for my dogs.  I always read the label and make sure that the dogs chews/treats/food is made in the USA and wholesome products.  The ingredients look healthy and today  I gave one to my senior wire fox terrier to keep him occupied at my office.  He went though it in record time and vacuumed up the crumbs as well.  A four paws up from here. Giving only four stars because I still don't know the outcome of today's chew!
1,"I was quite impressed by these chews!  My dog is allergic to almost everything, so a lot of dental chews are out, but these have very few ingredients that are allergens and my dog just loves them!  The pumpkin one also helps with her digestion (pumpkin always has a way of doing that!)  They are definitely tough to chew, but my 15-pound dog is quite the chewer so she's in heaven!"
1,My Chow girl Anaya loves these & they are made in the USA. Always a plus with so many treats that are made in China! YUCK.....
1,"I am impressed by Halo's products, although the canned food variety is the only thing I had previously tried, when I was babying my dog while she was recuperating after her spay surgery. I can feel good about feeding her such wholesome food, and she devours it. This was my first time buying Halo treats. Even though the package says they're for dogs 25-60 lbs, my 17 lb, one year old terrier mix is still in the puppy stage and is an avid chewer. I was looking for a product to change it up from the old reliable rawhide, for something she would not demolish in 5 minutes, and something different than meat-flavored treats (for variety). I was unsure if she would go for the pumpkin flavor, but this was an instant hit! She LOVES the taste of these treats and has no problem chewing them. I gave her a whole stick and she worked on it (kept her occupied) for about 45 minutes until it was completely gone. They smell really good, like pumpkin pie spice, and although they are dark brown in color, they do not stain like some of the red-colored rawhide products I've tried. I have gone through half the bag so far (7 sticks in a bag), giving her one every few days, and she really enjoys them. I am definitely buying these again, and I am going to try the mint variety and see if that's a winner too. I'd recommend that even if you have a small dog, give them a try to switch up your choice of hard chew treats if your puppy or dog is a big chewer."
1,"Our 1 year old pup loves these things! They are a bit harder to break like the previous review stated but the whole stick is actually perfect size for our Mini Aussie (med. size dog). The leave his breath smelling minty fresh! Also the heart shape is a cute touch.<br /><br />Too bad our local Petco stopped carrying these all of the sudden, but thank goodness for Amazon :)"
1,"Halo truly is a great brand, natural and healthy. My only drawback for these are that if you have a smaller dog they are very hard to chew and break up for them it seems as my dog is having trouble with them. They are good though an stick by this product as well as the seller!"
1,"These have great ingredients and smell so good, I wanted to eat it lol. However they are really hard so if your dog isn't a big chewer, like mine, it's not such a good idea. Brownie stopped trying after 30 minutes. So these are going to be donated to the animal shelter. These are for medium to large dogs, not so much for small dogs unless they're really aggressive chewers."
1,"We've tried other Halo products previously and have been happy so we thought we'd give this one a try.<br /><br />We first bought these at our local pet supply store when we ran out of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KSQXKO"">Paragon toothbrush chews</a> one day.  It turns out that our 15lb pom mix loves Spot's Chews and they smell great to us as well.  The only issue is that it's a lot of chew for a small dog, although they are labeled as being for ""small/medium"" pets.  They are hard to break so my husband was slicing them into thirds with a knife and we'd give a third of a chew a day.<br /><br />One cute thing is that if you look at them top down, they are actually shaped like hearts."
0,"I worried that my dog would swallow one of the chunks that came off the stick whole. It looks very dangerous! I gave my dog one and threw the rest away, as a precautionary measure."
1,"I ordered the 200-count box of 4-inch bones for the first time, and I'm happy with the purchase so far. My dog is small but a ferocious chewer, and supervised pressed rawhides are the only way I can afford to sate that desire. Amazon has the best prices I've seen anywhere.<br /><br />I do think I underestimated how small the 4-inchers actually are. They're not bad, but for the next purchase, I may opt for the 8-inchers, which are currently slightly cheaper on a per-pound basis.<br /><br />I ordered my bones direct from Amazon. Based on one of the reviews, the first thing I did was count the pieces. There were exactly 200 in the box. As seen in the product photo, the Ranch Rewards box has a large opening. Before shipping it, Amazon places it into another, much more secure, box. Perhaps some of the third-party merchants take less care."
1,"i dont know if they taste good or not..my dog eats them, and every time i ask her she tilts her head sideways and gives me the silent treatment like i'm speaking some foreign language to her."
1,"THERE SHOULD BE A WARNING LABEL ON THE PACKAGE THAT SAYS: ""YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO STOP AT LESS THAN THE ENTIRE BAG; HOWEVER, SCHNEIDER'S IS NOT LIABLE IF OVER-INDULGENCE DOES OCCUR!"""
1,"Pleasantly surprised, should have been the original pretzel-type recipe!<br />...but, am sure technology is the only way they could make a pretzel-type snack so light and crispy, not hard and sawdusty at all!  I usually can't eat more than a few pretzels, but these I can probably munch at least ten.<br />The dough is rolled with random air pockets somehow inside and if there weren't or aren't it's still airy-light and crispy, unexplainable...<br />Well, that's the texture, the taste is light and delightfully tasty.<br />These would be terrific if I had some dip, but on there own they are great, but not terrific.<br />They don't seem to fall apart into little pieces either, pretty stable when you bite it.<br />Ir looka about 3 inches long...hey, I believe they were rolled up on a piece of metal, then cooked...why they have a hole throughout the center that is not punched, but flaky layers around it.<br />Some bites taste buttery, some multi-grainy, all great...I love a snack that every single spec tastes the same.  It's not often an actual five star pretzel-small breadstick at a reasonable price with a hefty portion....they are a lot lighter than pretzels, so more volume."
1,"Tastes more buttery and less sweet than the Trader joe's honey twists.  Kids will eat it for snack.  Good stuff, but if you're looking for a sweeter taste, go to TJ's for the Honey twists."
1,"Love it!!!! A pleasant soothing cup of tea.  Always order this tea at our favorite Indian restaurant , now we can have it at home whenever we like. Plenty of recipes for making it as they do in restaurants. Enjoy!"
1,"As the other reviewers have said, this is not a K-cup! I uploaded an image of one of these pods next to a K-cup for comparison. The difference is the filter is exposed in these pods as opposed to being fully sealed in a K-cup. Since the coffee is exposed to the air when you open the package, you will have to seal them with a clip or put them in an airtight bag or tupperware to prevent the rest of the pods from loosing freshness. Having said that, in my experience they are a great inexpensive alternative to use in your Keurig brewer. The 36 count boxes arrived as unmarked brown cardboard boxes, not the colorful retail packaging shown on amazon. Inside each cardboard box, there are three clear heavy duty plastic bags, each of which holds 12 of the pods. The bags are not resealable!"
1,"I did not buy this at Amazon even though I am an avid amazon shopper.  Needless to say I went to cosco with a friend and got this exact box for $25 at Cosco.  I debated getting it and once it was in my cart I had two different people tell me how much they loved the coffee and with 80 pods at that price I figured I would try it.  I came home at 8 pm and decided to open it up.<br /><br />IN THE BOX:  Inside I have 10 clear plastic bags each with 8 pods.  The bottom has no plastic white thing I am used to and not only is the coffee in a mesh bag making it so you can not store it in the carousel (it is loose and falls out) you would not want to because it would lose freshness.  SO the other 7 went in Tupperware.  I give it 2 points for helping the environment and 4 for the price without trying it!<br /><br />TASTE:  Brew it at 8pm (not the best time for coffee but ahhh)  It smells absolutely amazing!  Super strong odor if you like the smell of coffee.  Color is very dark, smell is strong.  I taste it black and it is stronger then even the jet fuel k-cups.  Add some creamer try it again and then add a little more and it is the best coffee I have had in my life and that says a lot as Paris had some amazing coffee!<br /><br />Needless to say I grabbed the phone and called my friend who also bought a box after the two people commented on how much they loved the coffee to find out she had tried it and loves it as much as I do!  If you are debating trying this like I was I am hoping this review will help as I think I have finally kicked my expensive k-cup habit and I no longer need to worry about losing a bang for my buck!  Hopefully amazon will start matching Cosco prices as I do not have a cosco card though :)"
1,"These are a wonderful alternative to expensive K-Cups.  After opening up the sealed bags, I kept mine in a ziplock bag until use.  The 80 count French Roast is significantly cheaper at Costco."
1,"This is a wonderful coffee, and it works perfectly in my Keurig Platinum. There is no noticeable residue in my coffee cup, and the flavor is excellent. I recommend storing the unused 'pods' in a resealable storage bad to maintain their freshness."
1,"I think I have tried almost all of the k-cups, and really was ready to get rid of the machine because of the weak, almost tasteless coffee.  I like strong, bold coffee, and this one is excellent.  And the price is very nice, too!"
1,"I was mildly surprised by the shape of the K-Cup but the first time I tried it in my Keurig Coffee Maker, I was provided with an excellent cup of very rich coffee.  This is a great product for an excellent price.  I highly recommend this product to any Keurig Owner."
1,"We purchased this coffee yesterday for the first time. It's a very good coffee.. an 80 count box was under $25, that's half the price that it's listed for here. Of course it was at Costco.. The most worthwhile membership I've ever owned! If there is one near you, pay your membership.. buy your coffee there.. it will only take saving half the cost on your coffee on 2 boxes to pay yourself back for your membership! You can store your pods in a ziploc bag to maintain freshness after the celo packs are opened. If you are like us as coffee drinkers, it won't last long enough to get stale anyway."
1,"this is a delicious coffee that is good any time of the day.  black, with half & half or milk & sweetener it is great."
1,"Pelindaba Lavender and honey is the perfect combination. It's so heavenly tasty, that all other honeys are just not worth it anymore."
1,I have actually visited the Pelindaba lavender fields a few years ago on a visit to the San Juan Islands so was thrilled to see this product available.  I was reminded of the warm smell of lavender growing in the July sun with bees swarming around the plants.  One of my best travel memories.  Love this honey- it has a more lavender flavor than some honies but is really wonderful.  Great value for the money.  Adds a wonderful something extra to Greek yogurt or to a bowl of fresh blueberries.  Fresh blueberries take very well to a little dollop of lavender honey. Try it!
0,"Priced in the range of a CASE, this is a single box.  If you buy this you are paying three times the full price for a box.  You are getting ripped off if you buy this!!!!"
1,"I've been a tea lover for a long time, though I generally drink loose leaf varieties.  I tried this for the first time at an office location I was doing some work at and was immediately addicted.  I now keep it and the caffeine free version on hand at home at all times.<br /><br />I've tried many different spiced tea's and have never found anything similar.  The spicy smell is comforting and warming while the flavor is strong and delicious.  The 25ct package is the commercial package and larger than I could find in the local grocery for a similar price making it a good deal.<br /><br />The only thing I've found is that I like it steeped longer than usual.  Typically you would steep this for 4-5 minutes, but I like it with a stronger flavor and generally leave the tea bag in the entire time I'm drinking it.  Make sure you squeeze the bag as well or the flavor can sometimes be a little weak."
1,This herbal tea is wonderful and naturally sweet.  I highly recommend for anyone who likes drinking healthy and decaf products.
1,"I really love the Good Earth Tea, too, and have it every day.  But until they changed the formula a few years ago, I could get 2 good cups of tea from one teabag, and now it only makes one."
0,"I ordered this partly because I wanted the cute paint can.  The shipper was slow to ship it, and when it did arrive, the gum was not in a can.  It's in a cheap plastic container.  If that's what I had wanted, I would have gone to Sam's Club."
1,"If you like the taste of strawberry Pocky or strawberry Yan Yan, you will like these.  My fiance and I have an  American palette, but we were hooked on Hello Panda ever since he bought the ""Milk"" (Vanilla) flavor on a whim from the international aisle of a supermarket.<br /><br />They arrive in individual boxes packed in a display box (like at a store).  The individual packaging make them easy to throw in a bag or purse on the go (easy for pacifying fussy kids too!), and the individual outer cardboard package means these creme-filled cookies don't get crushed by your water bottle. :)"
1,These cookies are great. The biscuit part is not too sweet and the inside is a nice vanilla flavor. The designs are super cute as well~
1,These little chocolate cream filled cookies are pretty darn good.  I sent a few boxes with a friend of mine to take to work with her.  The people she works with devoured what she handed out and they were asking for more.  Looks like those folks will be placing orders with Amazon.com for more of these little chocolate cream filled devils.  Thanks Amazon.com.
1,"I bought these when I couldn't find the Choco-Koala cookies we usually buy. These are great little cookies and seem just like the Choco-Koala cookies. A light crunchy exterior with a wonderful chocolate center. They are small, so you can quickly chow down quite a few. Very, very yummy. Santa always remembers to bring some for the kids. Don't buy just a few boxes, get the whole case!"
1,"I bought these for a Halloween party with a lot of 2 & 3 year olds.  My kiddos treats were the hit, all the kids loved them and asked their parents for more.  Several parents said they snuck some of the cookies from their kids and loved them.  A fun snack for all!"
1,"these are by far the best cookies ive had in a long time, almost addicting for me xD"
1,Saw it at F.Y.E. At there unlike Amazon it was only $3.00. It was worth buying after I tryed it out. Taste like a fortune cookie with vanilla filling inside of it. Love it and yes would highly recommed.
0,These are made with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil; an adult can make the choice whether to eat them or not.  But why give them to kids with a perpetual sweet tooth who don't know any better?
1,"Very flavorful and gives amazing taste to salads and food in general. Just a pinch make a huge difference in the way your food tastes like.  This is the only type of salt I am using since I discovered it. I put it on meat, fish, veggies, salads, soups,etc. Everything tastes better with this salt. I wish they would offer it in bigger sizes. I usually order 4 at a time so they last for a while since the size is small. You will not be sorry for ordering this salt."
1,A good buy if you are looking for a fairly large quantity of Green Mountain Breakfast Blend Decaf.  The price of shipping made the individual cost of each cup a litter higher in cost but not to much.  I would buy again.
1,"Our family loves the White Grape flavor of Crystal Light. In fact, if it weren't for this flavor, some members of the family would have never drank Crystal Light at all. It has a great taste that's not too bitter and not too sweet.<br /><br />It seems like the availability of this flavor has been going through ups and downs for the last few years, with many people even claiming it was discontinued earlier. It wasn't discontinued then but I stumbled upon Crystal Light's official Facebook page where someone asked for a list of recently discontinued flavors. Crystal Light responded with a list and - lo and behold - White Grape was listed as a flavor that was discontinued as of November 2011. Here's a link to a screen shot of the post by Crystal Light for anyone who wants to see it - the post was made on Feb. 13, 2012: (...)<br /><br />After running into the post, I confirmed via the Crystal Light official website and White Grape is no longer listed as an available flavor in any quantity. So it looks like this great flavor, possibly one of the best Crystal Light had, is no more - sacrificed to market all the new ""specialty"" flavors."
1,"White Grape is my all-time favorite Crystal Light flavor ever. Imagine my despair when, one by one, my local stores quit carrying it! One evening, while looking for Christmas gift ideas on Amazon, I decided to do a search for it and was so happy to find this 10-count box of ten. My order arrived very quickly and with no problem. I will definitely be buying more of this!"
1,Love White Grape Crystal Light.  Can't find it where I live.  Great to know I can get it here.
0,"When I purchased this item, I was oblivious to the meager amount of on the go crystal light white grape packages that was being purchased!! My ignorance of course! Each small box cost over 7 dollars. Do I feel asinine!"
0,"You are kidding about the price right??  $7.66 a box??  glad you can afford that, I can't....<br />this is by far the best flavor ever, but not in my budget.."
1,Best product that crystal light produces and well priced and can not buy in stores anymore. Great taste and easy to use
1,"A box of 10 packets of mix will do several more than 20-30 glasses of drink.  Don't need to use entire packet per drink.  Prompt delivery, packaged safely against shipping damage.  Have not been disappointed yet with service from orders placed with Amazon!!!!"
1,"Was just what I wanted, I bought this in the market but they quit stocking it so I tried Amazon. Lo and behold they had it!  But I learned that I must browse when looking for it as I found it cheaper from other vendors..but I am very pleased the my purchase."
1,"Whenever I try and cut the caffeine I have struggled--usually I would have to order a Cafe Americano type thing (watered down, decaffinated espresso--tastes just like a regular cup of coffee, but oi, the price!) because I could never find something drinkable I could brew myself.<br /><br />A friend bought me some Peet's for my birthday and when I shopped to buy more (it is ALL excellent coffee!) I decided to give the decaf a try.  It was amazing!  I really could not tell I was drinking something decaf--and it was just their regular coffee--not espresso or anything else.  I have tried most of the different flavors at Peet's and the coffee is consistently fabulous--including all the decafs (for some reason I don't care as much for their Sumatra but my husband assures me it's my imagination as he loves it).<br /><br />In any case I HIGHLY RECOMMEND any and all Peet's coffees but most particularly their decafs like the French roast.<br /><br />As I always caution buyers on Amazon, look to see who the vendor is if it's not Amazon directly.  The products stay the same but the vendors may vary.  This includes some that actually keep their stock on Amazon's shelves which is great for shipping but also examine the pricing structures carefully.  Do your due diligence regarding the specific vendor including ratings, prices and shipping policies.<br /><br />That said, the decaf Peet's coffee is amazing!<br /><br />JTG"
0,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CMKPDI"">NEW! POOP-FREEZE Aerosol Freeze Spray (10 oz)</a> This product worked fine on regular poop, so what, I can pick that up with a baggie any day.  I purchased this product for when my dogs had loose stools but it did not work on hardening these stools up to prevent a messy clean up.  Sorry, it appeared to be a great idea!"
0,You know those cans of air you buy to clean your keyboards & other things?  Try turning one of those cans upside down and spraying the poop -couple of blasts - each about 5 seconds works great! That and a putty knife lifts it right off the carpet!
0,"Doesn't do the job of hardening or drying up the poop enough to pick up right away. You still have to give it time to air dry, which defeats the purpose..."
0,"The spray does at least partially freeze the poop all canine owners need to responsibly pickup, but it falls well short of the product claims. My family has used it under varying weather conditions and had uneven results, though we have precisely followed the directions. It is most effective (provided the directions are followed exactly) on very solid stool and least effective on soft/running stool. The obvious problem is the latter is exactly why one would purchase the product. We bought it to do a more thorough job picking up after our dogs on a multi-use trail. We bike with our dogs (using Walky Dog) and like to leave the trail as clean as possible for others and to ensure dogs continue to be permitted to use the trail. The product did not help as much as we had hoped. When our multi-can supply runs out, I don't think we will purchase more."
0,"They don't explain you not only have to take the can out but then find and put the straw on..not easy with 1,2,3 or 4 dogs on leashes. Then the item does freeze the mess but also the grass. Also you need to turn the item over and freeze the back ""according to the instructions"".. I have been unable to do this. I guess its an art... like... flipping pancakes.<br />The freeze spray does help but don't expect it to be anything like the commercial"
0,One can is not enough for a movement from either of my dogs. I try to be proactive by feeding them lots of popsicles. It does seem to work better in the winter though.
1,This is great stuff. My dog gets the runs from time to time. Just zap the juicy pile and it comes right up. It also makes clean up a lot easier. Usually I wait till it ages a while before I chuck it in to my neighbors yard. Now I don't need to and my yard is nice and clean.
1,"My dog's poop is generally soft and hot and my son and I dislike that oozing-between-the-fingers feeling on the pickup.  Works well on most dog poops, not effective on diarrhea.  Would be better if it was combined with an applicator scoop so that after freezing it the scooper would scrape it up."
0,"So not only does this not work at all on any type of fecal matter that is not solidified (and randomly, at best, on already hardened stool - in which case, the product is really pointless anyway), but when I got the item in the mail, I was both amused & shocked at the directions. It indicates that you are supposed to spray the top of the poop, then there's a step where you must flip the poop over to spray the underside. Well, if I'm gonna flip the crap over, I may as well just pick the damn thing up. Pardon the pun, but this product is the biggest 'waste' of money ever."
1,"I used to use liquid nitrogen and believe me it was painful!<br /><br />I nearly lost one of my fingers once, but now it's all in the past all thanks to Poop Freeze. My life is now complete and worriless."
0,This product is a waste of time. I have been getting far better results freezing my own poop using my ordinairy under counter freezer! Why would you wait for the dog to go?<br /><br />Pointless!
1,I love this product.  My dog drops bombs in the house on a regular basis.  Perhaps he does it just to let me know that he needs more attention or maybe he does it to piss me off.  Poop Freeze has saved the day!  It makes picking up poop easy and fun.  Did I say fun - YUP.  My kids love picking up after the dog outside in the yard with Poop Freeze.
0,"Price:  $29.98<br />Sale:  $13.20<br />You Save:  $16.78 (56%)<br /><br />What? For one tiny single itty bitty TEN OUNCE can. I got burned once this way, never again."
1,"Here's the trick.  If you zap it on the ground,  it sticks to the grass. Not good,  especially the gummy stuff.<br /><br />What you need to do is position your can so that as ""scruffy"" is doin his deal you get it before it hits the grass! Don't shoot too early though..."
0,"When my dog usually lays a loaf, it's of the super soft squidgy kind.  Kinda like a Hostess Snowball.  After using this product, his doggy little debbies are a bit more solid, but still way too squishy for me to want to pick up with my bare hands!<br />So do what I do!  Sprinkle some cat litter on the poop and convince your dog that it's cat poop.  He'll scarf his own doggie tootsie rolls like they were leftovers from dinner.<br />How's that for recycling Mr Gore?!?  BOOYAH!!"
0,"Last time I checked, water based products such as Poop aren't really frozen at 62 degrees F.<br /><br />Personally I try to catch the poop in a zip-lock bag and take it straight to the deep freeze. This prevents freezer burn and that white crusty layer."
1,"These pretzels are evil. When my snacking comes to an end, I see flashes of myself laying on the unkempt wooden floor of an abandoned house. Scant beams of light burn between the cracks in the boards on the lone window frame, illuminating my tattered and orange-stained clothes. The sound of my body writhing over a pool of empty yellow aluminum bags, a half foot high up the empty broken walls, is quieted only by the echo of my cries of longing and despair."
1,"These little pretzel pieces are totally addictive, which is probably not a good thing because they're a lot worse for you than you'd think pretzels should be. They have around 60 fat calories and 3 grams of saturated fat in ONE ounce, which equals out to be 15% of your daily sat fat intake per serving (one ounce).<br />The reason they're so good AND so fatty is that the mustard/onion seasoning is in an oil that permeates through the shell of the pretzel, making them extra flavorful and not dry at all. They're a little sweet, have good mustard flavor, and the onion flavor even comes through a little (they taste like they're supposed to). I try to just grab a handful at snack time and quit while I'm ahead, but I usually end up going back for more later.<br />If you're willing to put up with a little extra fat for a lot of extra flavor, these are a perfect snack."
1,"If you like pretzels and you like hot wings. Do yourself a favor and try these. You will not believe how much like a true hotwing they made these pretzels taste.<br />Oh and to the 3 star reviewer who didn't like that they are hot. Umm they don't call them cool wings. They are not hot, but do have a spice to them. If you are someone that eats hotwings you will love them."
1,"I love buffalo wings; not just the heat, but the flavor! This product, while not offering tongue-burning, sinus-clearing heat, has good bite to it. The flavor--how can I describe it? It's very addictive! I can down a whole 10 ounce package in no time. I'm not sure if I'm imagining it, but there seems to be a hint of a bleu cheese taste in there as well, which adds to the whole ""hot wing"" experience of the snack, in my opinion.<br />My kids like these as well. I have to hide the bag from them sometimes just to ensure that I get my fair share."
1,These are delicious. Taste exactly like a buffalo wing should taste. They are not very healthy but I don't care. I love them.
1,I'm a girl from buffalo NY and these have true Buffalo hot wing /hot sauce flavor. I can easily eat a whole bag - although it probably would not be wise. Do yourself a favor and buy this snack! I just bought a case to give as treats to friends that enjoy a good hot wing
1,I've tried the Buffalo flavor and loved them.<br />They taste great all by themselves or tossed in a salad.<br />Then I saw they had jalapeno.<br />Anything with jalapeno and I start drooling all over myself.<br />I saw.<br />I bought.<br />I ate.<br />I cried...they were all gone.<br />I bought more.<br />(Brian doing happy jalapeno dance).<br />Delicious.<br />Unhealthy.<br />Who cares.......recommended.
1,"Snyder's Honey Mustard & Onion Prezel Pieces might very well hold the title for most delicious non-candy snack item.  A large bag rarely lasts a day in my house, which isn't a good thing when they're pretty caloric.  They're so delicious you just want to stuff a whole handful in your mouth and slowly suck the flavor out of them, crunching on the remains as you look like a mad squirrel.<br /><br />I would go as far as to say that you could eat these every day and not get tired of them.  I would replace every meal of the day with these things if I wasn't afriad of them giving me heart disease.<br /><br />Try them once and you'll be hooked.  I have tried the other flavors since some stores run discounts, none of the other flavors were anywhere near as good as the Honey Mustard & Onion.  Buttermillk Ranch is ok, but you can't top Cool Ranch Doritos.  Cheddar Cheese wasn't good at all, and Buffalo Wing was hard to eat (flavor makes your hands all nasty)."
1,There are many types of honey mustard pretzel but the Snyder Honey Mustard pieces are the best most flavorful and satisfying to me others just don't compare and are lightly flavored in comparison.  I LOVE them.
1,"This is a kind of pretzel that will make your taste buds tingle, if you honestly don't like pretzels much at all, you will love them after you try these pretzels.  They are the most excellent tasting pretzels around.  I would strongly inform people to try these amazing pretzels."
1,"Bought a trial bag at a local market.  Taste is very addicting.  The whole family loved it, even the little ones.  Bought bulk at Amazon and spread the wealth to other family members, co-workers, and friends.  All seem to enjoy this flavor and texture quite nicely.  Good price at Amazon and 12 pack is gone in no time."
1,Love them! Gotta have them! They really are good especially if you like HOT treats!
1,"If you like Buffalo Wings, You'll love these. I can't believe how they can make a pretzel taste so much like a buffalo wing. These are GREAT!<br />If you haven't tried them yet, do yourself a favor and try them today."
1,Everyone in the family (and my daughter's friends) like these.  Even though you get 12 bags they don't last long.  Need to refill every few months.
1,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G7V3BM"">Snyder's of Hanover Hot Buffalo Wing Pretzel Pieces, 10-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a> If you like pretzels, buffalo wings, heat and salt you will love these.  They are a product that actually delivers on their promises.  They are hot and spicy, but not in the bland heat just to say they are spicy of so many other products.  These have the heat and the vinegar tang of actual buffalo chicken wings.  I love them.  Unfortunately they don't last long at our house.  Once a bag is opened they are gone as the burst of heat you get from them is addictive. The only downside aside from the speed at which they get eaten is the orange fingers you get from them.  But that is a small price to pay for entrance into flavor heaven."
1,"I found the Butermilk Ranch Pretzel Pieces while on a trip to Texas a couple years ago.  My family and I feel in love with the flavor as well as the crunch.  But, to our dismay, that particular flavor was almost impossible to find in our state of Connecticut.  I found the web site and Voila!!!! Twelve scrumptious bags of the tasty treat."
1,"I am huge pretzel lover.<br />These in my opinion, are the best tasting pretzels out there.<br />They are TRULY finger licking good.  Everybody I know who has tasted them raves about the flavor.  I don't think you could have found a better combination of flavors to add to a pretzel.  I've tried Hanover's other flavors but they don't come near this all time favorite.  I did have to stop buying and eating them because of health reasons, but when I did eat them, I would not be without any in  my house."
1,These are pretty good and these are not low calorie..they are about the same as potato chips....so they are not like regular pretzels....get em on sale in Amazon Warehouse and then go make some friends.
1,"I just love these pretzels.  There was only one bag on the shelf at the store today and I nearly had a heart attack!  Totally panicked thinking ""Oh no what if they have discontinued them""  I sure hope they never will!"
1,"These are absolutely mouth-watering.  About 10 nibblers will cost you:<br /><br />-130 calories<br />-3 grams of fat(1.5 sat. fat.) - no trans fat<br />95 mg sodium (just 4% dv)<br />3g protein (amazingly you get protein out of this)<br />Less than 1g sugars<br />23g carbs (8% DV<br /><br />Also has 10% DV or less of: Iron, Riboflavin, Folate, Niacin, Thiamin.<br /><br />With the taste this good and nutrional value so great, this might make you ditch the fatty chips and start buying these.  I don't even feel guilty about over-eating these from time-to-time.  I solute Snyder's for making these!"
1,"A few words that come to mind.....amazing, wonderful, astonishing, delicious, fantastic, and delightful.  Thank you Snyder's of Hanover for these pretzle pieces bravo!<br /><br />These are the next best thing to an actual Buffalo chicken wing!"
1,"These taste great and they are my snacking weakness! however, they get on my nerves because the non-uniformaly shaped pieces exhibit the brazil nut effect where granular particles of similar/equal density tend to be on top aka the larger pretzel pieces tend to be in the first handful but as you eat more the smaller ones are always on the bottom of the bag no matter what you do. frustrating but unavoidable. just be aware.<br /><br />snyder should get a better pretzel chipper machine or whatever they use and keep the size consistent! if it works for potato chips why can't it work for pretzel???"
1,"I don't like pretzels and was hesitant about trying these but omg they are gooood!! I couldn't taste the actually pretzel, just the hot wing. I love this and definitely adding to my favorite snacks. The honey mustard isn't bad either but hot wings are #1!"
1,"These are not sold in stores where I live, so I had to order them online.  They are the best pretzels ever, we eat them all the time."
1,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G7VYRA"">Snyder's of Hanover Cheddar Cheese Pretzel Pieces, 10-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a> package claims these pretzels are bursting with flavor. I agree with this claim, my family agrees with this claim, my son's family agrees with this claim; as a matter of fact, everyone I've shared these pretzels with agrees with this claim.<br /><br />These are hard, sourdough pretzel pieces.  I'd guess the average size is 1/2"" x 3/4"" - 1""  of all different shapes because they are randomly broken. I ordered these using Amazon's subscribe & save program which brings the price down to less than I'd pay in the supermarket. Twelve packages are a lot.

0,"These taste great and arrived well packaged.  However, be prepared to eat these in a hurry - the expiration date was only 2 weeks away when they arrived. Eat quickly or throw away.  Amazon really needs to improve this problem."
1,"Excellent product, received promptly and fresh when opened. However, I found it was priced about the same as in Walmart. I expected more of a price bargain when ordering in bulk."
1,"Love this snack!  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G7VYRA"">Snyder's of Hanover Cheddar Cheese Pretzel Pieces, 10-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>Cannot find it locally any more so Amazon is my go-to store.  Ordering is easy & convenient, price is comparable to stores, delivery is quick."
1,"excellent product, however high in salt, but I love them...recommend to all<br />people who like spicy stuff.."
1,these pretzels are so great! i purchased them for my husband because we can no longer find them in the grocery store. i highly recommend them to anyone who likes spicy foods.
1,"I bought a bag for our road trip and everyone just dived into it till it was all gone. Nobody could stop, even those who don't usually like pretzels. It's savory with a hint of sweetness. Yum."
1,"Although these are really excellent by themselves, I use them as croutons on my daily salad.  Totally wonderful.  It just wouldn't be a great salad without them."
1,"As a rule, Snyder's just makes the best pretzels, hands down.  They've been making them for 100 years now and well, there's a reason they're still in business!  These are great - they disappear rather quickly.  My only complaint is that they're small and very hard so they scrape the roof of your mouth.  Other than that, they're the best tasting things out there.  Highly recommend!"
1,These are the best pretzel snack out there.  The broken pieces really soak up the flavor which a whole pretzel would not.<br /><br />And what everybody else said!
1,"Goodness, these are soooo good. the most tastiest snack on the planet. It lights up your eyes. and you go YUMMMMM. and you cant stop. they are addicting !  There must be a cult fan club over this particular snack if there isnt one already. Get someone to try it who never had it before. They will be addicted as well."
1,"These are awesome tasting, like authentic Ranch dressing, but dont eat too many in one sitting as the flavour can overpower!"
1,"These are spicy and salty, and highly addictive if you don't worry about the salt content. I am sure after the case of 12 I will die of kidney damage one day. But they are that good."
1,"My son discovered these somehow so we purchased some from the grocery store. Yummy. Very salty (but not as much as the buffalo wing flavor), and yes, not as ""good"" for you as the regular pretzel, but hey, they taste 10 times better. Bag gone in 10 minutes. Thanks to the other reviews I now have no fear getting the box of 12..."
1,"Snyder's are the best quality pretzels, in my opinion.  The fact that they have been around for 100 years speaks for itself.<br /><br />Also as a retail convenience store I get my supply from Amazon because the price is right.  On Subscribe and Save I make over 40% at retail price as oppose to the 25% I use to with a local middle man distributor."
1,"Oh Glorious day when I found the best snack treat on Amazon.  Just like hot wings, except in pretzel form.  No longer have to wait for the store to get in stock, I can order online now."
1,"These pretzels are wonderful.  The heat is present but not overpowering.  My 4, 7, and 13 year old kids love them.  Try using them in your ""famous name cereal"" party mix.  It makes a big difference!"
1,"I tried these as I had already ordered the regular Snyder's pretzels.  They are very good and very hot.!  If you don't like ""hot stuff"" they are probably not for you."
1,"I really loved  Snyder's of Hanover Cheddar Cheese Pretzel Pieces, 10-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12).  The taste is fabulous and texture is crunchy.  Mine arrived a little broken up but that doesn't change the great taste.  Just smaller bits to nibble on!  Wish I could put this order on automatic!"
1,"If you are in the mood for good eats (ok maybe Alton Brown can charge me for that) try these jalapeno pretzels. They are very good, not too hard and great flava flav. And it's really true you get 12 packages."
1,It can be hard to find this flavor in the grocery stores; I made sure to stock up.
1,"Who knew they could put buffalo wings in a bag?  These pretzel pieces are absolutely wonderful . . . and  . . . a-hem . . . less fattening than actual chicken wings.  All the glory, less fat!  Yummy!  Yummy!  Yummy!"
1,I am hopelessly addicted to these jalape&ntilde;o pieces. Someone help me. I need some kind of medication to wean me off of them.
1,"I tried it in a party and found it very tasty.  It is kind of oily, though."
0,"Taste is good.  Received the product on Oct. 22nd, 2009, but ALL 12 bags expires on Nov. 29th, 2009.  Only 38 days to eat them all or give away.  I will NOT order again."
1,"These pretzels are very tasty when you crave a salty, mild cheddar cheese flavor. They are crunchy and hard, which I love. But, the box was one bag short (11 out of 12)."
0,"Very flavorful, jalapeno is a fantastic concept for Pretzels. Random bags yield random results, the first pretzel in your mouth is an awesome experience, for the most part.<br /><br />But, for crying out loud, why do they have to add an YEAR'S WORTH OF SALT in one friggin bag?!! It's not consistent, sometimes you get lucky with the top portion of the bag when it's not all that salty, but by the end of one bag, you do get the feeling that you have consumed an ocean's salt content. Why this idiocy? When all one craves for is the taste of spicy jalapeno? The sucker that I am, I eat the first couple of pretzel pieces and then throw the whole bag away, it's serious sodium poisoning if you do consume the whole bag."
0,"Snyder's of Hanover makes good pretzels (Honey Mustard & Onion is my favorite), but these are just not appetizing at all.  ""Hot Buffalo Wing"" gets its kick from dried cayenne pepper sauce.  So if you are a fan of peppers you might like this pretzel.  They are nowhere near as good as Honey Mustard in my opinion, though they aren't as bad as just cheddar cheese.  Hot Buffalo seems to be enhanced by eating them with other food, in my case, chocolate M&M's.  If you like a spicy zing, try these pretzels, they are not horrible.  If you like sweetness just stick to Honey Mustard & Onion.  Nutrition-wise, are not the best as they contain MSG and caramel color.  Also, if you consumed an entire 10 oz. bag in one sitting, you would be consuming 1400 calories.  I guess their good if you are trying to gain weight like I am trying to do.  Otherwise stick to the healthier counterpart of the unflavored ones."
1,"I just finished a 32 ounce bottle of Lakewood Organic Lemonade. What a joy to drink lemonade that tastes great without high fructose corn syrup, sugar, cane sugar, or sugar substitute.  This lemonade has pure agave and white grape juice used for sweeteners; therefore, I can serve it with confidence knowing that it is good for me and my family. I don't think I will ever buy another brand of lemonade again.  Try it . . . you'll love it!"
1,"I tried the lemonade as it was recommended in the ""eat this not that"" series as I was concerned about the amount of sugar in normal lemonade and juice.  Absolutely the best lemonade out there!"
1,Lemonade is Wonderful Tastes Great but not too sour!!! Enjoyed all six bottles Immensenslly!!! Well packaged no broken or Cracked bottles!!!!!!
1,we have lots of food allergies and search for something real well this Lemonade is the right one for us and we would buy it over and over again can only say good things
1,"I have read that Community Coffee is good and beloved around New Orleans. I'm a regular Kona and Blue Mountain drinker so I had tempered expectations but boy I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I like full flavored coffee and my brewing of choice is a dark roast through an aeropress followed by sugar and cream. The Community dark roast is very tasty. A nice full flavor with a sweet/non-bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />Obviously everybody's taste is different, but I'm very pleased with this one."
1,"........so I decided to try the Whole Bean Dark Roast this time and this is one of the better coffees I've ever tasted. Expiration isn't until May of this year. My last experience was the CC Hotel Blend and that was a disaster. Expiration on that was 1 month after I ordered it.<br />  Anyway, this coffee is strong and smooth. When you can taste the smell of coffee beans, then you know you have great coffee. I got it here at a great price too. May purchase if it goes on sale again."
1,"Great deal for a decent coffee. I didn't give it five stars frankly because it is not starbucks:) I happened to grab this when it was on sale, which I am leery of spending a lot of money on a coffee on a brand that I have never tried. So I got a great deal, tried it and am very happy with it. It may not be my # 1 choice of coffee everyday, but it does a great job at filling in the other days as my caffeine! Will buy again."
1,"I used to roast my own coffee beans to make the freshest tasting coffee.  But, ever since my local roaster upped their prices of the raw green beans, I decided to try this coffee out.  Community Coffee often goes on sale, and you can sometimes find it as low as $2 a bag!  At those prices, I could not resist.<br /><br />The coffee comes with a brew by date, and that tells me a lot about the quality of the roasters.  The bags also have a one way air bag seal to keep the coffee fresh.  The quality of the beans is 100% Arabica, and that's important for flavor.<br /><br />Overall, really good coffee, especially for the price!"
1,"This is very good whole bean coffee. I have had better, but it is well worth the price. I have to brew a couple of more scoops than normal to get the rich flavor out of it, but it is still more than worth the price."
0,"The box arrived on July 22, the date on the coffee bag is Sept 30.  So that doesn't leave much shelf time here.  Thing is, most vacpac coffee has at least a 6 month shelf life, so that is worrisome.<br /><br />Opened the bag, no smell.  That in itself tells the whole story.  Coffee is aromatic.  You open a bag of bean, particularly french roast bean and you're going to smell coffee, even before you grind it.  It's the nature of the oils on the roasted coffee beans, and it definitely affects the flavor and experience.<br /><br />no smell.<br /><br />Brewed up a pot this morning in my cuisinart coffee grinder/brewer:<br />beans were not consistant in roasting, some darker than others<br />no aroma when brewing whatsoever<br />coffee turned out very dark<br />med chicory like flavor<br />coffee flavor not strong or rich.<br /><br />I've been playing with this coffee for a couple of days and after a while it's not terrible.  Compared to a stronger flavored French Roast, it pales.  But on it's own, if this is how you like your coffee, okay.<br /><br />I can't say if it's the blend of bean or if it's fact that it was roasted a long time ago and it's lost it's strength.  But it lacks a rich coffee flavor.  except it has that mild chicory backtaste going.<br /><br />so if you want a mild coffee with a hint of chicory, you found it."
1,"I normally use Illy whole coffee beans medium roast for my Jura Capresso S8 machine.  Sometimes I use Illy dark roast which has a richer and stronger taste plus no aftertaste, but of course I can't always justify spending that much money all the time.  Then I found this Community Coffee Whole Bean Dark Roast.  I'm very happy with it because it is similar in taste to the Illy dark roast and is much, much less expensive.  I'm sticking with this product from now on."
1,i have been using coffee beans to make expresso and in my french press. I really like the taste of this coffee. Family owed business grown in the USA.
1,"Ever since I can remember, Community Coffee has been a staple in not only my family, but my husbands as well. We drink it, our kids drink it - it's a crowd pleaser. Since my husband can only drink decaffeinated coffee, he sticks with Community Decaf. However, every once and a while I'll buy my own bag of Dark Roast. I've been introduced to others in the Community family recently and have found Huehue Tenango and Cafe' Special are two very delicious coffees. There are many blends I still haven't tried, but rest assured I would recommend Community Coffee to anyone.<br /><br />Faithful Community drinker,<br /><br />Connie"
1,I have tried many different brands of Dark Roasted Coffee and I keep coming back to this coffee.  It is delivered quickly and has the best deep roasted flavor of any thing on the market in my opinion.
1,"the dark roast in general is good, whole bean or ground.. even better when its only  3.33 per bag..<br />the other roasts are pretty bland by comparison- you have to use a lot of coffee to make it taste good..<br />the dark is good. compare to Starbucks dark sumatra..<br /><br />nice."
1,"I gave this a shot and it turned out much better than expected.<br />For the price, it cant be beat.<br />Much better than the (nine-1) O'clock that are at similar price point, packaging<br />and variety. Beans are shiny and smell good. Gave you a sense of freshness."
1,"This is a really great tasting coffee.  I brew my coffee using fresh ground beans and a press every morning, so I am a bit particular about coffee.  Actually, I am insane about preparation and quality of the coffee bean and I am always looking for the best bean with the best taste for the best price.  After reading all of the other wonderful reviews (thank you reviewers), I decided to give this inexpensive brand a shot.  Well, I am so very happy to say that it is delicious.  The aroma is full, taste is bold and rich with a very long lasting lingering flavor after the last drop has been drunk.  I am so happy with this that I became a subscribe and save member for it.  My next purchase will be the French Roast for my daughter, but I can tell you that I am going to be staying with the Dark Roast for a very, very pleasantly long time.  Yum"
1,"Actually, I bought 12 oz X 3 bags for my daughter.<br /><br />I am a coffee deal junkie and could not pass up this offer for US$14.58 (incl S/H and no sales tax)."
1,I like dark / bold coffee.  This blend does the trick.  And you can not beat the price. I will be back for more when these bags are gone!
1,"makes a delicious cup of coffee. dark, fresh,and the price is resonable.Would definitely order again.A hot cup of this cofee helps motive me in the morning."
1,"I'm on a bit of a Southern food cooking kick, so when I saw a great deal for this coffee, I jumped on it! 3 bags of specialty coffee for the same price as 1 bag of Starbucks is amazing, in my opinion. The bag is cute and more importantly, easy to open and close securely as opposed to some coffee bags. The beans smell lovely and my first cup was delicious. I subtracted a star b/c the bags are dated 12/13/11, which is not that far in the distant future. I will probably just be finishing up the last bag around that time, so it won't be expired, but I'd never purposely buy nearly expired coffee in the store--it just isn't fresh. If you go through more than one bag a month then I wouldn't worry about it--either way, it's good to support this smaller producer and put a little extra flair and ""flava"" in your day :)"
1,"This coffee is a great bargain. It is fresh, and rich, with no bitterness. I really enjoy a good, dark-roasted coffee, and was very happy to discover Community Coffee. People who favor a dark roast coffee should know that this blend of dark roast does not have a smokey flavor. Some people prefer the smokey flavor to their coffee (myself included), so I want to be sure potential buyers are aware of this. It still makes a fine cup of coffee, so I would definitely recommend that someone buys it at least once to try it, especially if they do not have it regularly available in their part of the country (myself included, again)."
1,BEST COFFEE EVER....DARK ROAST IS SO SMOOTH!  GAVE ME LOTS OF PEP IN MY STEP ALSO!  NEW FAVE!  MAKES STARBUCKS TASTE LIKE MUD!
1,"I like the stuff! Despite of its dark roast it doesn't taste any bitter or cause any heartburn. It has a rich & full flavor, just what I need for early morning breakfast. I prefer to buy the whole beans version, because it keeps fresh for a long period of time and you are free to determine the grade of the grind."
1,"Great Coffee and a Good price! Can't get it in whole bean here, nearest is 3 hours away. Amazon to the rescue! Even a cheaper price than the store!!!"
1,This is the second time I've ordered this coffee. I really like it! I have found a new regular for my grocery list.
0,No aroma and tasted like cigarette ash. I think the beans were rancid when I received them since they were so close to the expiration date. Beware of low price because you get what you pay for. Old beans!
0,"The dark roast coffee is not at all 'full bodied' - if you are used to coffees like Starbucks, Coffee Bean, Peets, etc this will be a major disappointment."
0,"Easily the worst whole bean coffee I've ever tried, tasted like cheap ground coffee from a can.<br />Not dark at all more a medium-light roast. Had a nasty bitter flavor and maybe a stale flavor, pretty horrible, will be throwing it out.<br />EDIT: as it's so light, once I adjusted the grinder to quite a bit coarser, it was better and drinkable. This is a LIGHT roast, do not grind on fine.<br />Still not very good coffee."
0,I didn't notice the expiration date until a few weeks after I got the product. I was stunned that it was going to expire in 3 months. I would never buy any stuff from this seller anymore.
0,"I expect my dark roast to be exactly that. DARK. This was not. It was a dried-out, light brown mess that wasn't even as good as Maxwell House. One pot was more than enough to come to a conclusion about this. We're using the remainder as lawn fertilizer."
1,Regular oreos are good but the golden ones are way better. First you don't have that embarrassing dark pieces stuck between your teeth like regular Oreos. And the golden just have a better flavor.
1,I order this for my son because this is favorite cookie and I will do it again. Thank you for having this product. God Bless.
1,"It all started when I was working late at night, no food left, and no place open to get food in the building. I stumbled across a snack machine wanting cookies, but the only cookies they had were golden oreos. I opted to try them since I loved regular oreos, and they were the most delicious cookies I've ever eaten.<br /><br />Now i get the full size packs for at home snacking, and they're delicious. They taste similar to regular oreos, but are vanilla flavor. The creme in the center is still the same, so no flavor change there.<br /><br />The new packaging is also great, no more opening one side and having all the cookies go stale. You can lift up the tab on the top of the packaging, and you can see all the cookies in plain view. When you're done, just reseal it, and it magically closes perfectly and air tight each time.<br /><br />I haven't tried eating them with milk, or dunking them in milk yet, but I'm sure they're just as delicious as the regular Oreos. Another nice bonus is the fact that they don't turn your teeth and tongue black like regular oreos do. I always opted out of eating regular oreos in public because I didn't want people to think I had bad teeth, but these leave no marks or stains all over your mouth.<br /><br />Buy them on amazon, they're delicious cheap, and you cant just have one!"
1,"For those of you who wondered what a vanilla Oreo might taste like, look no further. I love original Oreo cookies, but I also really like vanilla/yellow, and when this cookie came out, I tried it, and it did not disappoint. Uh-Oh Oreos (vanilla cookie with chocolate frosting) is also really good."
1,"I also bought these at Costco for $10.00 per box which included 24 bags that are .8 oz each.  My kids are fighting over the few remaining bags, and they are very good, but I won't be buying them again due to the price.  The high price will prevent this product from reaching mass distribution."
1,"I bought these as part of a promotion they were having at our Costco over the weekend (8-28/8-29) in Lakewood, CA and these fruit snacks are great. The Tasty staff at the store wasn't kidding me when they said that 24 for $9.99 Costco promo was 60% off the retail price. I thought to myself even with ship and save I thought oh they can't be that bad, but the price is $23 even with ship and save. Now I wish I would've bought a few more of these yesterday to get my 4 yr. old through a few months of eating them once a week at preschool. I seriously hope Costco gets these and or they lower the price on them because honestly even here in the LA area where people don't care what and how much they spend on food I don't think the idea of $2.00 pouches of fruit snacks is going to last."
1,"I'd give this candy five stars (great texture, great flavor, pretty colors, no corn syrup!) except for the fact that the packaging it comes in has a distinct chemical smell - very like silicone, but with an edge of something else.  I don't know if it's the plastic or the printing or what, but if you have multiple chemical sensitivities, you may want to have someone else open this up for you and put the candy in another container so you don't have to deal with the chemical stink.  FWIW, the candy itself doesn't seem to pick up the smell, so maybe it is the ink on the outside of the pack after all.<br /><br />I don't have MCS, but I found the smell so offensive that I dumped all the candy into a bowl and got rid of the packaging ASAP.  Just too stinky.  Sorry Tasty people, you make a great gummy, no question about it, but your packaging may taint the experience for some."
1,"These are the best snacks. Kids and adults love them alike. NO added refined sugar. Take on the road, Send to school. Pack to take to work. LOVE these."
0,"Being Greek and loving cooking I bought this ot make some dolmades. Now let me tell you, 90% of a dolma success is about getting good leaves. Best leaves must be young fresh leaves that grom on top of the vine and are cabbage-like green. The leaves growing on lower part of the plant are way hard and useless for cooking. Well this product was 99% these leaves. Even after boiling these for 1 hour they were useless. Do NOT buy."
1,"I was very happy with these grape leaves.  They were a nice size and firm ... Not torn, easy to work with... Very satisfied and would recommend the purchase.  I will again and again."
1,"While I love this product, I feel disappointed the seller no longer offers this with Prime 2 day shipping.<br />My dog is a super picky eater, and she really seems to love Fromm.  I switch between flavors so she stays interested."
0,"I bought their dry food and canned food based upon a New York Times review.<br /><br />Well, maybe my dogs are spoiled but they would touch any of it, ever!<br /><br />I will donate them to an animal shelter."
1,"Dynamic Health Organic Beetroot Juice comes closer to fresh than any other bottled beet juice I have tried. It's also a little more expensive.  When I am traveling and can't make my shake, I usually drink about sixteen ounces a day.  I have found the plastic bottles sturdy enough to travel safely in checked luggage.<br /><br />Most mornings, I add fresh, diced beets to a shake in the blender.  No bottled beet juice even comes close to the strong taste and intense color of fresh beets.  Even though they are only about one sixth by volume, the fresh beets impart a vivid red-violet color to the shake.  The color and taste of beet root juice in bottled products is pale by comparison. Lacking scientific research, it is hard to know how much, if any nutritional value is also lost in bottling."
1,"Very good deal, my babies love them. All three were born in the month of October so the gourmet dog cookies were a nice treat."
1,Treat yourself or your guests!  They are rich and give you a great chocolate fix.  Especially great with coffee. One goes a long way.
1,"I love this so much, I love the combination of the chocolate but i wish they put more white chunk chocolate."
1,"These are really, really good.  Expensive but they are almost like eating a candy bar.  The cookie is a crumbly cookie, not a soft one."
1,My wife and I live near the local producer and got our first jar late last year.  We love it!  I didn't know how good caramel can be and believe me this is truly amazing stuff.  My wife loves the traditional method of pouring it on ice cream while I like to mix it into shakes.  The flavor and texture is truly something you've never had and we both highly recommend this product!
1,Stronger than some others but you can't stop at just one cup !
0,...at least by the time they reached us perhaps months too late. Sticky with no flavor other than sweetness; literally tasted white as nothing.
1,We love Melville items I use these all winter long for Hot chocolate and they make wonderful gifts. I have used many different Melville items from different places the quality is always excellent.
1,"This is a wonderful guilt free snack.  Taste and texture are wonderful.  It has helped having these around, so I'm not tempted to buy higher calorie/fat snacks.  I think they're just as good as the friend ones."
1,A great healthy snack with lots of flavor. I have enjoyed each and every bag and have shared a couple with friends.
1,Very tasty and love that it's a measured packaging.  Allows me to regulate how much I eat. Very glad we bought it.
1,I personally think these are way better than Cheetos. Some people may find them a bit buttery. They are very addictive.
1,"My wife and I really like these.  When we are on the Nutisystem program, they are a great substitute for Nutrisystems Cheese Curls.  They are very similar in nutrition, the only difference is that nutrisystem adds some protein powder to their product.  These taste great, and we like them much better than Cheetos even when we are not dieting."
1,"Excellent quality, not to cheesy or filling.  I feel good to give these to my girls because they are baked and a bit healthier, will deff by again!"
1,"these taste exactly like chee-tos.  how nice to find a gluten free, baked product that far surpasses the original!  my boys love these in their lunch boxes."
1,"I was looking for a healthier ""salty flavor"" treat when I came across Season's Baked Cheddar Cheese Curls - and I LOVE them!!!  Now I have to say that if you did a taste test with regular cheese curls you would definitely taste a difference, but I found this healthier option to have a great taste all their own.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this item to anyone looking for healthier snack foods - it's a winner in my book!"
0,"Wow, Michael Seasons cheese curls used to be my favorite snack. However, the last shipment I received was terrible. Is it possible to petrify a cheese<br />curl? I have no other explanation for the strange taste of this order. I am sure that ""bad"" cheese curls are not typically a problem with this<br />company, but still, I now am the owner of 24 bags of yucky curls.<br /><br />I will continue to support this natural foods company ***BUT*** only by 1 bag at a time!!!"
1,"I like cheetos, cheese curls, etc. but most are too high in sodium/salt and calories for me, now.  So I gave these a try.  I actually like these better.  They are low in sodium, low in calories, still have a cheesy flavor, and are not greasy/oily like many of the others.  No, they do not taste exactly like salty cheetos/cheese curls!  And on my first taste, I was not sure...but by the time I had finished the first (small) bag, I was hooked. Your brain just has to get over that ""hey, these aren't cheetos!"" moment.  Only 100 calories per bag (3/4 oz.), 30 from fat.  And only 160mg of sodium! Zero Cholesterol. 15g carbs. 1 g fiber.  Darn good for this kind of snack food.<br /><br />A 3/4 oz pack is pretty small for a big guy, but not too bad.  They're pretty satisfying.  The texture, crunchiness, cheese flavor, and so on all seemed fine to me.  I really like 'em.  Taste is very subjective, of course, but I think most kids would be fine with these and they are very definitely a healthier choice.<br /><br />So thumbs up from me for these tasty baked cheese curl snacks!"
1,I have to admit I was very cautious about this product.  I couldn't believe that something that low in calories and fat could be as tasty as my favorite snack product.  I must admit I was wrong.  They are very tasty and it is nice to have it in a convenient serving size bag.  I would highly recommend trying these cheddar cheese curls.  I seriously think you would enjoy them!!  I hope Amazon will continue to supply these and the many other wonderful low calorie products they have.
1,I don't care for these but my kids like them. They don't love them but they eat them just fine.
0,"Not sure if they were ot not but they didn't have the great crunch the 'real' full fat product they resemble has.  They are like that product after it has gotten stale.  It looks like it but the artificial cheese taste, which never bothers me in other lite products, just makes it worse. If they could work on the stale-like texture I could get used to the taste. I am totally sold on the Snikiddy Grilled Puffs so there is no reason to ever order these again.  Big disappointment.  I can eat them so they don't get wasted but no point in spending good mney if there is an alternative in my opinion and I am a HUGE fan of lite snacks."
0,"My family is organic and gluten free and we have found genuinely tasty snacks, but this isn't one.  The taste is not ANYWHERE remotely close to real Cheetos. They actually tasted like they'd turned. They don't even look like the picture on the outside. I can't even imagine how someone else WOULD like them so I'm really thinking the rave reviews are fake. Or written by someone who's never had a real Cheeto.  ugh. I may give them to the squirrels out back but I might get charged with cruelty to animals. YES, THEY ARE THAT BAD."
0,I didn't like these Baked Better Cheese at all. I've ate a lot of fat free and low fat but these were really bad.  Help I like cheetos! Just make these a little better and I'll try them again. chips.
0,"To my taste, I found there to be almost no cheese flavor at all. There was also an odd background flavor that was not at all to my taste.<br /><br />This, of course, is my personal view, probably skewed by my own eating habits. Your experience may vary.<br /><br />For the record, I don't think that Cheetos taste like cheese, either!"
0,Not great but my youngest child likes them.  I am not sure we will order again but I am hoping my daughter will finish the box.
1,Organic ornage juice is difficult for me to find until Amazon offered this.  Rocky Mountain organic frozen ornage juice is awesome.  Its only 100 calories for 8 fl ounces and theres no added sugars or chemicals.  It arrives frozen and feshly packed on ice packs.  Shipping is extremely expensive so order many to get your money's worth.  I was very pleased with this purchase and the company gave me free samples ot their grape & lemonade flavors too.  No pulp and mix with flitered water with just 24 ounces per 8 oz frozen.<br />Its USDA certified organic and you won't be dissapointed in the product.<br />If the shipping was cheaper I would buy this on a weeklty basis.  Something you must try if you are into healthy living/foods.<br />5 stars
1,I was so glad to find this product online. I can't locate it at any of my local stores. It is human grade and my cats love it.
1,"We have an 18 year old tortoise shell cat and she loves Pinnacle.  She can't eat chunky/shredded wet food or dry food any longer and is quite finicky. It's a bit more expensive than dry or even the store bought brands, but the vet says that canned food is the only way to go with an older cat to make sure they are getting enough hydration."
1,"Oh man, I do adore this flavor of Luna Bar.  And yes I'm a boy.  Come out of the closet, gender-defiant Luna eaters!<br /><br />One concern.  As of August 2012, this listing doesn't specify how many bars are in the box.  If you're paying more than 99 cents per bar, you can do better at Trader J's or BB and B (if your BBB carries items like this).  Targ&eacute;e has them for about $1.15 each in bulk.  I think there are bulk places that might beat these all.  Caveat emptor.<br /><br />But this flavor is delicious."
1,I have loved every product I have purchased from this company. The strips of tomatos are easy to reconstitute and perfect for throwing on pizza and pasta. Yummy!
0,"I tried giving this to my dog, but the dog wouldn't even try it.<br />It smelled pretty awful to me too, I don't blame her.<br />It smelled like a pureed spinach and miscellaneous foods shake.<br />I'm sure it was healthy, but she has to eat it first.<br />Other dogs may like it, but mine didn't.<br />I probably have her spoiled on people scraps!"
1,"These pup treats come very well-packaged, so there's no breakage.  The cupcake cookies are adorable, with a nice assortment of decorations/colors.  They smell good, so I know the ingredients are of good quality.  These make quite an impression as gifts, as they are very unusual -- and, pups LOVE them!"
0,"Despite the name, these are not really cupcakes. They're just flat cookies. The sprinkles fall off pretty easily, so be careful to clean up after yourself. On the plus side, our dogs liked them."
1,Great product for the price.  I used this for marketing reasons for my pet sitting business and it worked great.
1,Cholula Garlic hot sauce is so good that I could happily drink it out of the bottle. This product goes on everything really nice. I like to put it on chicken while i'm cooking it.
1,"Let me start out by stating, I am not a hot sauce fan! I hate Tabasco, yet this garlic chili sauce is the best addition to my meals. It gives your food a subtle kick, nothing spicy or too overpowering. Great hot sauce to have on hand."
1,"This is a great product for a great price. Most other retailers were much more expensive. The shipping from the company was a little slow but saving as much as I did, that made it worth it."
1,"I discovered these figlets this morning and bought a bag to try. Lovely! All of the figs in that bag were soft and full of flavor, perfect for eating straight from the bag.<br /><br />I came here hoping to find them and I see that the Subscribe and Save deal on this is excellent (I paid 70 cents more per bag locally today). Pity the 10-ounce bag isn't currently available.<br /><br />The other reviewer's experience really surprised me. They didn't say what the best before date was. The bag I bought today has an expiration date of Aug 2013 and the figs were not tough or dried-out at all.<br /><br />I can't wait to make bread with these delicious little figs."
1,Not sure about the negative reviews other than maybe theirs were out of date... but to me these are the best figs. Alot better than Sunmaid which many times contains alot of over-ripe figs. These are just right. Too bad my local Kroger stopped carrying them. Highly recommended.
1,We love these little figs.  They are a great snack and a pop in your mouth size. Will definately buy them again.
0,These Blue Ribbon Orchard Figlets are packed more dirty than anything I've ever<br />bought. I am now opening up the 8oz. bags and spraying them down after soaking them to remove the grime and dirt.
0,"If you like your popcorn with a bit of salt as I do, avoid this product. Trust me. It is full of odd ingredents,and completely devoid of flavor. I picked it up at the store two weeks ago, because it was the only item available (*real* popcorn salt has, for some reason, completely disappeared from the shelves).<br /><br />(Amazon - please - allow us to give a ZERO star review.)"
0,"I admit that I am only reviewing this here because of my frustration with this product.  My store stopped carrying the old standby brand with the adjustable sift top and only carries this fancy labeled alternative now.  The holes are simply too big for fine salt; you cannot get good control if you seek perfection in your seasoning.  I have ruined more than one batch using this dispenser.  Unless you are extremely careful, you will oversalt your popcorn."
0,"It's just regular table salt sold at a higher mark up and mislabeled to attract the unobservant. Buy diamond crystal salt in the large container instead. Real popcorn salt is what movie theatres use. It's yellow, has a strong flavor that resembles butter but is unique as well."
1,"We have Scotties that are aggressive chewers, so there aren't many products safe enough to leave out on the floor for them while unattended.  Of the ones that are safe, these dinosaurs are their favorites.  And the ones that chew them the most have the cleanest teeth.  We always have them on the floor."
1,"My pit loves to chew so I purchased this because it looked durable. It is very tough toy and I think it will last awhile compared to others I have purchased. The only thing I didnt like is that it has little ""nubs"" all over it which make his gums bleed, but that might not be the case with a less agressive chewer."
1,"I bought one of these to start and both my dogs loved it, so I bought another one so they didn't have to try and share one. I got lucky and actually ended up with two different styles of dinosaur. I love nylabone products and will probably put another dino in my amazon cart soon!"
1,Great for all dogs.  They love them.  I have one in almost every room.  It prevents chewing on your stuff!
1,My Frenchbull is only given nylabone's to chew. He has had them since he was 7 weeks old. They are safe for him because he has a strong bite and they don't break off in large pieces that he could choke on. The Dinosaur Chew is perfect because it has so many places to hold and bite.  Dylabone is the only product I buy.
1,"I have the happiest pack of dogs in Florida.  Dinosaurs make great chew toys, and my three love them.  Every time the basset hound is let outside, I have to stop him and examine his mouth so he doesn't sneak the toy outside where it would get lost."
1,My 7 month old puppy loves this dinosaur chew.  The texture is bumpy and helps massage his teething gums. Great product for the cost.
1,"I have a one and half year old Labrador Retriever that is still nuts. You probably know how desctructive a big dog can be. These take about two to three weeks until its at the point I need to just throw it away. My local SuperPetz used to carry these, and then they stopped. Here I am online buying them. My dog seems to prefer the shape of the Brontosaurus to the T-Rex. I think this because he will just chew on the T-Rex, but he actually plays with the Brontosaurus. Also, I have two other dogs that are older (around five), and they won't touch these toys unless they are playing with the young Lab.<br /><br />Sidenote: At Walmart, I have found the Hartz Chew'N Clean Dog Bone Country Bacon Flavored Large. He also loves that one, and it is $5. I have to get him a new one every other week."
1,This is a favorite toy in our house! It's extremely durable and my dogs do not get tired of it. Well worth the money!
1,I have a one and a half year old shiba. He loves to chew and enjoys this toy very much. Amazon's price is way better than what you will find in a pet store.
1,My chocolate lab chews on stick's all the time so I got her one of these dinosaur toy's and she just LOVES IT!!! and no broken teeth!
1,"I have a 4.5 year old 70 LBS. Doberman Pinscher that absolutely loves these Dental Dinosaur Nylabones!<br />I've gone through several over the years because she loves chewing on them and being so cheap on Amazon, they are well worth it!<br />Even my vet recommends them and is how I found out about them.<br />Every Christmas, I send them to a friend for his dogs and they love them too.<br />They are not sharp when new, but after some chewing, they will get sharp so watch out when walking barefoot around or trying to play tug with the dog and the dinosaur.<br />It doesn't matter what shape she gets, she tears right into it when she gets it!<br />It would be neat if they made ones that were much bigger to watch them chew and carry it around as if they just took down some large animal in the wild.<br />I'll continue to get these even though they can hurt when you step on them barefoot and the shreds get caught in the carpet because my dog and friends' dogs absolutely love them and it helps to keep their teeth clean!<br />You should still clean their teeth by hand on a regular schedule though."
1,these bones are great. my dog loves them and they are good for her teeth! they break off in tiny pieces so that she cant choke on them too.
1,"I am so happy I made this purchase, my dog loves it. She takes it everywhere. She doesn't over do it with the chewing,but that's because I always make sure she has different options available to her to keep her entertained. Please remember that when giving a chewing toy, you are there to supervise, it's all trial and error, it works for some and not for others. This is a good toy, keeps her entertained and off my door frames!"
1,"Don't know what the appeal of the dinosaur chew toy/bone is but the dogs LOVE it! We had to order two of them to avoid a fight, so they can both have one at the same time."
1,"El producto me lleg&oacute; en una semana hasta Costa Rica, lleg&oacute; en buen estado y es de buena calidad, le quito una estrella ya que me lleg&oacute; un dinosaurio diferente al que ponen en la foto pero aun asi estoy satisfecho con la compra."
1,"My dog liked everythin she recieved, and enjoyed the bones. And she liked the wiffle ball very much. These are great items, all of themThe Manufascturer can be very proud, olf all of these items.  My dog Sophie in Ohio."
1,"My dogs LOVE Nylabone products, and they are both aggresstive chewers. This dinosaur is durable, and neither of my dogs have been able to destroy it so far. The only complaint I have is that the tail and the head are very small and pointed (the Stegasaurus is the one that came) which my dogs might be able to break off if they chew hard enough. Overall, I think it's a great toy, and as long as my dogs are happy so am I!"
1,"Our Aussie loves Nylabones more than anything else. She usually gets the bigger bones, but I gave this one a go and she just carries it around with her everywhere she goes. It's quite funny and very cute. I highly recommend this item!!!"
0,"I ordered this for my 15-lb Jack Russell. We got the stegosaurus toy and so far, it's held up. She's a ferocious chewer--we can't buy her anything but Nylabone-type toys or they immediately get torn to bits. The only problem I foresee is that the stegosaurus has four legs sticking off of the body, and I know those are going to get worn down very quickly as she can fit that whole part in her mouth at once, meaning she can't play with this unless we're there to see her least she chew off a leg and choke on it. It would've been nice to be able to have seen this variety and choose which one we wanted prior to ordering. I was thinking we would get the T-Rex pictured, which only has two feet that seem to be attached to the tail. The good news is, steggie doesn't have a small projectile head or tail, but rather it curves to give the impression of head and tail, so no worries about small pieces coming off there. The toy itself I would probably give 3.5 or 4 stars, but I am only giving it an overall 3 because the ordering process is inflexible.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have lowered my rating to 2 stars. She has had this less than 5 months and I had to take it away from her after she managed to chew away the legs, tail, head, and half the body. I don't mind if she ingests tiny shreds of a Nylabone on occasion, but I can't imagine eating 4 ounces of plastic is doing anyone's digestive tract any favors."
1,my two puppies fight over this toy and i have thought about getting more.. but have yet too lol its a mint flavor i think and great for medium and smaller dogs definitely not for a bigger dog over 50.lbs or more... both of mine are about 35.lbs and its the perfect size for them =)
1,"We have a new dog that we adopted from the shelter, and she loves to chew on EVERYTHING.  When I got this in the mail, she was so excited, she took it in her mouth and ran in the other room to chew. She loves this and it keeps her (somewhat) from chewing on the furniture, etc.  Just make sure and pick it up before heading to bed at night - I've stepped on it in the dark - ouch! LOL"
1,"This looks like an awkward and not very amusing toy, but both of my dogs are crazy about them.  They've had one for months and they chew on it everyday, so we ended up getting another one so that our two dogs won't have to fight over it.  They are avid chewers but only are able to break off little harmless shreds off of these toys, so they are really durable.  A great buy!"
1,"I'm a little torn between 4 & 5 stars...Daisy (25-lb. terrier / minpin / border collie mix) absolutely LOVES LOVES LOVES this toy.  I actually had to stop her from chewing it when I first gave it to her.  If I had let her, she probably would have chewed for another hour (since she had gone a full hour without stopping for anything).  The only downside (and I don't know if her teeth are still setting, but I know she has all her adult teeth so it can't be that her baby teeth are still falling out) is that her gums were bleeding after.  I found traces of blood on the toy as well.  I'm sure it is natural for her gums to bleed a little as the toy is pretty sharp, but I am limiting her use of it regardless.  If we are talking about how much she loves it, however, it's 5,000 stars.  lol...."
1,"I received my dino nylabone toy today and was stoked to get the T-Rex. It's much smaller than the picture makes it appear, but that's perfect for my medium sized cocker mix. This toy is hard as a rock and I don't anticipate that he'll be able to destroy it anytime soon, even though he's an obsessive chewer.<br /><br />I was also really pleased with how quickly I received the toy and that the seller didn't charge any shipping fees. Score!"
1,"My two terrier mixes (20 lbs. and 32 lbs.) love to chew, and their paws-down favorites over the past five years have been Nylabone Dental Dinosaurs. We go through 2-3 sets per year and have have no problems, with the exception of an occasion bit of gum bleeding (very slight) when someone gets a bit carried away. Well, that, and having to confiscate the toys when we're trying to sleep, since their chewing enjoyment is a bit too noisy for nighttime!<br /><br />After months of use, I take the worn down toys away and replace them, and I regularly check to make sure there are no sharp edges or larger parts that look as if they could break off and be ingested.<br /><br />If you have a dog that loves chewing, I've say to give them a try, at first with supervision. If your dogs are like mine, these toys will offer many hours of entertainment and cleaner teeth to boot."
1,"I have a 2 year old Siberian husky who never had her teeth brushed. The vet was very concerned about the tartar build up. Since I have gotten this toy, its has help with her tartar build up! She loves her toy so much she carries it everywhere we go! I recommend this!!!"
1,"We have two year old pit mixes and a 5 month old APBT, who are medium to aggressive in chew style. A lot of times the nylabones get overlooked or hidden deep under the couch, but this one was a cherished toy. Our male would carry this around, showing it off to everyone. All three really enjoyed the texture, and it lasted a good month before it was sent to chew toy afterlife."
1,We have two puggles.  Both LOVE this toy.  Dino is always at the top of the toy list and can stand up to their aggressive chewing.  Will be ordering a second one.
1,I've had the triceratops for over a month now; it's been chewed non-stop by each of my four large dogs plus one foster dog. It's still in great shape and showing little signs of material wearing away. I've also noticed a substantial decrease in the tartar on their teeth and fresher breath as a result. Be willing to spend a few extra bucks for quality... this is a great product!
1,"I thought this would be a little bigger, but that's okay since my American Pitbull Terrier is only 5 months right now, and my Ridgeback mix is medium sized. This is a great size for small-medium Dogs. It's an interesting shape and my Moms cairn terrier mix female claimed it right away! Haha. It's textured for teeth cleaning and strong for super chewers! As with any hard chew toy, do keep an eye on your pet while they chew so they don't hurt a tooth. Ive heard that this can be a problem."
1,"Imagine an 80 pound mastiff/boxer mix, a 12-pound min-pin mix, and a 12-pound rat terrier fighting for the same dinosaur chew toy! Not a pretty picture. So,we ordered one for each. Okay, they still fight over them, but not as much, but whoever looses the battle can easily find another dinosaur to claim. The dinosaurs are fantastic for helping teeth stay pearly white and keep gums happy. And they last a long time. A definite must-have."
1,"The first time I bought this for my rottie/hound/lab mix he didn't stop chewing it for an hour which was the longest by far anything had held his attention.  It's extremely durable - I didn't need to buy another one for 5 months and that was only because it started getting small enough where it was about to become a choking hazard.  I bought one for my mother's cavachaun who is an avid chewer and it's also kept him content.  It does a great job of keeping plaque build up off his teeth, as I just noticed now that he has been without one for a couple months and I'd gotten lazy on the brushing.  Needless to say, another one has been ordered and is on the way courtesy of prime shipping."
1,"My 1 year old border collie is an agressive chewer.  This is one of the few toys that lasts in my home for more than a day.  The only disappointing thing about this order was that the title says ""Dinosaur Varies,"" but I got 3 of the same dinosaur. And while you might think that my pup wouldn't know the difference, she doesn't seem as interested in this one as she was in the one that I have in another shape.  Maybe because there is nowhere to grab that isn't pointy?"
1,"I have a one year old Yorkie who's destroyed EVERY toy she's ever had (63 to be exact).  She's a voracious chewer and I just can not find a toy, no matter how durable it says it is, that she can not eat through within the first day or so.  I took a chance on this toy and she absolutely LOVES it!  And believe it or not, we've had it for 3 weeks and she has only slightly gnawed it down.  I think this is definitely a 'keeper'."
1,"I am always pleased to use Amazon to order various items.  We ordered 3 Dental Dinosaurs and as always, we were pleased with the promptness and the quickness in which we received our order from the supplier.  Thank you."
1,"Out of all the chew toys I've bought, these get the best reviews. My dogs have almost forgotten that they have other chew toys or even stuffed animals, for that matter. They are soooo obsessed with these dinos, I've already purchased more!"
1,"Of the countless toys our Frenchie has this toy takes the cake as her favorite.  We brought it to a puppy play date with 5 other dogs and this was the one toy everyone wanted to chew on.  Its super durable, the dino shape is fun (which is honestly why I originally bought it) and it occupies hours of her time.  Best toy I've ever bought her. She has the T-Rex."
1,"My GR puppy destroys all soft toys so I get her the durable plastic/rubber toys. She randomly chews on this dinasour and it has held up well for the past 6 mths she has had it. She is now 10 mths old. A good, durable chew toy."
1,"If you have a lab as a pet, this is a must buy. Sidney, my yellow lab, has had her share of chew toys --beginning with ropes, moving onto squeeky toys, stuffed animals, and tackling all types and sizes of flavored nylabones. And, I haven't mentioned the things she's not supposed to chew (believe it or not, it's bluetooths....that's her favorite alternative). She quickly grew bored off all, but one --Nylabone's Durable Dental Dinosaur. She absolutely loves it!!! And, it's taken her months to break it down. She loves it so much, I purchased one for our home, the dog walker's house, and the car. I don't ever want her to go without it. And, you won't want your dog to go without it either."
1,"looks gnarly but our dog loves to chew it.  after 4 months you can't tell it was a dino.  our dog loves to chew it and we hope its good for the teeth as it claims.  we also have the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ZIM58"">Nylabone Galileo Bone Dog Chew Toy, Wolf</a> which is more robust."
1,"We have a Doberman/Lab mix - this thing has lasted a *long* time and it is his go-to chew toy.  We have a few bones that have lasted long as well, but these are by far his favorite and used almost daily.  Highly recommended, buying more for him for the holidays!"
1,"Not only do my dogs love this chew toy, but our daughter's dog does as well. We always have several of them around the house."
1,"the toy is excellent. my golden retriever is teething and this has been perfect for her.<br /><br />4-stars because product description is not accurate. picture showed T-rex, but i received a brontosaurus. no big deal but if there are multiple models the description should indicate which one you're getting"
1,"I decided to try this product after having previously bought the Nylabone Pro Action Dental Dog Chew with great results.  I must say, so far so good.  Although you are not given a choice to choose which dinosaur shape, my beagle/jack russell mix does not mind and loves her new stegosaurus!  Previous like products last about 2-3 months with the little dogs constant chewing and the occasional chomping from my Basset Hound."
1,"I normally buy the Large, super durable Nylabones for my 35lb shepherd mix.  However these were on sale so I decided to give one a try.  Both of my dogs LOVED this bone as soon as it arrived.  However, it is much smaller and softer than the bones I normally buy, and it did not take long at all before it had been chewed into something to small for my dog to safely continue chewing  on.  If you have smaller dogs who don't have a shepherd's powerful jaw, then this bone is for you."
1,If dog is a chewer like mine was..this is the toy for you!! He loved these things and they take a while to really destroy..if the ever.  Only dog that my puppy could play with and not destroy the first year that I had him.
1,We have a very small (5 pounds) poodle that is a power chewer.  She loves this chew and can spend hours simply chewing on it.  It is very durable and lasts a long time.
1,If you have a Dog that likes to chew these will become your best friend! I have a Parson Russell ( Jack Russell Family) and he is a Heavy Chewer. He Loves these Denta-Dinos!
1,this is a great chew toy - my dog is a heavy chewer and the nylabones are better since they are broken down and passes through his system w/ no probems.  i got him this one along w/ the galileo souper.  This is a good size for him and the irregular edges really appeal to him.  These last quite a while and the textured surface creates a good grip for their paws in addition to massaging their gums.  It's been about 3 weeks and he's not quite half way through but will definitely keep replenishing these.
1,"I originally purchased one of these for my puppy when I brought her home.  By six months she had chewed the dino's head and tail off but it was in good shape.  We lost her dino at about 9 months and I found that she was becoming destructive in her chewing.  She can destroy a stuffed animal in 2-3 minutes, sometimes less.  She has a new dino and is very happy.  We tried other chews but they don't have the nubs on them which she seems to enjoy.  I purchases back up dino's in case we ever lose one again.  It's kept her out of trouble with her chewing.  This is a great product.  She is a Cavalier, I would not give this to a large breed dog because I think it would be to small for them.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000084E6V"">Dental Dinosaur Nylabone</a>"
1,"Great product for those puppies or adult dogs who can chew through anything. This will keep them busy for sure. Once your pet gets this started, chances are it will be a favorite chew until the nubs wear down. I have two power-chewing Puggles. Unlike everything else I've tried, this is NOT a 5-minute toy. They seek these things out and it satisfies the need for a good long gnawing session."
1,"My dog loves these things. Hes a moderate chewer, so it takes him a few weeks to go through it, but I suggest you throw it away when it starts to get too small if you worry about the jagged edges. It doesn't seem to get moldy (thank goodness) but one major drawback is stepping on the darn thing barefoot! OUCH!"
1,We love nylabones around our home. Our two goldens must have the durable nylabone as they quickly destroy a flexible one. I thought that this Dinosaur Nylabone was the bigger size since it said Wolf but it was pretty small at 4 inches. I had to give it to my friend's cocker spaniel. It was just too small for a golden retriever.
1,"My little Jack Russell's just love these durable dental dinosaurs, I usually buy three at a time and they last three to four months. Great entertainment and my 3yr old dogs teeth are sparkling...They crew them every morning just like we brush our teeth....Anyhow if your dogs love hard chew toys these are winners!"
1,"I'd been eying the Nylabone Dental Dinos in our local pet store for awhile but put off purchasing one for our four month old sheltie figuring it'd be too hard or too heavy for him at such a young age... but then we revived one from my mother (non-dog owner) as a gift for the puppy and he loves it!  It's his favorite chew after the Nylabone Edibles (he's a little glutton) and he can spend hours chewing on it from all angles.<br /><br />He wasn't so keen on it to start out with, but a little playing (hold it out and then pull it back- not mean just to get him to chase it) has turned it into one of his favorite toys.  It's durable, easy to clean and the shape is quite engaging.  He can manipulate it, chew on the various limbs and carry it all around the house."
1,My dog loves the Nylabone Dental Dinosaur! Our vet recommends them for keeping the molars clean and the work. Highly recommend this product.
1,"My ten-months old 12 lb. pomapoo loves chewing on this dinosaur and it is 100% safe.  He is unable to chew off any kind of bits or pieces that would harm him if swallowed.  I tried the nylabone wolf bone and he was able to completely rip pieces off that he swallowed and I threw it out.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000084E6V"">Dental Dinosaur Durable</a>"
1,I have two pit mixed dogs.  They absolutely love this toy.  They are very strong and need something that holds up.  These dinosaurs are great.
1,"My dogs are incredible chewers, but these dinosaurs last a long time.  They love the odd shapes and textures. A favorite!"
1,I don't know what it is about these things but every dog that gets near these Nylabone dinosaurs goes nuts for them.  And it helps their teeth in the process.
1,If you have a dog that loves to chew these are invaluable!  My dogs love them and I can't keep enough of them in the house.
1,I had to order a half dozen of these dinos so my labradors could have one in each room.  These toys are very tough and last months for my chewing labradors.  No drawbacks whatsoever!  Thanks for the chewing exercise for the dogs and the entertainment value for the owners.<br /><br />Hope these dinos never become extinct!
1,I've had a Dental Dinosaur chew for about four or five years. Every dog in our house (three) has chewed on this thing and we still have it! It's hard which is great for our Chihuahua puppy and it's also a very good price! Would buy one again!
1,"My dog loves these chew toys.  The regular nylabone claws are boring to her, but the nubbies and shapes of the dinosaurs are great for keeping her occupied and her teeth clean!  Awesome product!"
1,This is my second dinosaur toy that I have purchased!! It is my dog's favorite toy. He is a strong chewer and this is very durable and keeps him occupied! Great product-we love nylabone!
0,"I was so excited to get this toy because it is very cute. We got the Stegosaurus version of the toy, and as soon as I opened the package my dog was just as excited as I was. Up until this point she had been barking at the UPS man who delivered it!<br /><br />This toy says it is designed for active chewers up to 50lbs. My 5 year old Clumber Spaniel is a very active chewer, and weighs 50lbs - I thought it was perfect! However, within twenty minutes, she had chewed it to the point where it looked like a giant wad of used bubble gum."
0,"After a week of having them..... Really don't care for this product. My dogs (2 4 year old mixed breed) were not excited about them. The girl had her's for all of about 3-4 minutes, then said thanks but no thanks and walked away. The boy chewed for about 7-8 minutes, then had enough. They stayed on the floor for them to enjoy at anytime, but they rarely have. And when they did chew them - well, I had small hard white pieces all over my rug. Needless to say, can't walk barefoot on the rug.<br />Sorry I made this purchase - especially at the price ! I do not recommend this product."
0,I ordered three of these dinosaur nylabones.  I only opened one and none of my dogs is interested in it.  It is coarse and has no odor to enhance its use to the chewers it is intended for and I'm out a pile of money.
0,"I have three dogs.  Two cocker spaniels and a jack russell terrier.  None of them like this toy.  They have had several Nylabone toys, but this one is the least favorite.  Each of them tried it out, but they all got bored with it fast.  It is very heavy and the points are somewhat sharp.  That may not be what turns my dogs off though because they have had other textured toys.  After handling it myself, I would be worried about it being to coarse and causing bleeding gums or injuring their teeth."
1,"My rat terrier is a fierce chewer, and the nylabone toys are great. She chews this dino every day and has only worn off part of the tail in a few weeks time."
1,I recently ordered this Nylabone product. My dogs love the dinosaur shapes! They can get ahold of them with their paws and teeth.
1,I have a six month pup that is about 35 pounds and chews EVERYTHING!  Totally demolishes whatever she can get her hands on!  I'm hoping this helps satisfy her chewing needs without being destroyed. It looks great and is exactly what I was wanting so fingers are crossed! :-)
0,This is not a toy.  It feels and weighs like a small white brick with thorns.  If i had not thrown away the packaging I would have returned for a refund.  Don't waste your money!
0,"I should have read the reviews on this, as I, too, thought I would get 3 dinosaurs given the picture and the word ""assorted.""  When I called customer service to complain, they said ""assorted"" means they choose for you which of the three assorted you will receive. While they wouldn't send me additional bones, they credited me $3.00 and were very polite in handling my complaint."
0,My 50lb dog chewed this toy for 3 days and his gums started bleeding.  This toy has too many sharp corners and is not suitable.
0,"This item was cute, but had absolutely no appeal to the 2 five month old Labs I have. They picked it up once and that was it. Basically, money wasted!<br />The company offered to take them back, but the postage would cost about the same as the item, so I declined.<br />Note: I've purchased several of the Nylabone products (toys to bones, etc.) for my pups, from 10 weeks old to their current 7 months, they have yet to use any of them at all.<br />Might work for some, but I ended up giving them all to the humane society."
0,"My 3 Girls won't give this chew bone a backward glance. In fact, my daughter had her two dogs over, and neither of them was interested in it either. And despite how cute it is, the Grandson didn't put it in his toybox. Waste of money all around."
0,The impression I got was that you were buying 3 dinos for $ 8.75.  Received only one....not such a good deal now.  Last time I will order from them.  Rip off!
0,I wanted a T-REX and I got a Stegosaurus.. seriously guys get with your local archeologist and get your ancient reptiles straight! Puppy lost it within 25 mins... BAD DOG!
0,"My wife & I religiously bought dental dinos for our corgi. He is a powerful, obsessive chewer that tore anything else apart that we gave him. He's been through many over the years. Recently, on a routine visit to the vet, they found that both of his molars on top were cracked & infected. They are currently performing root canals on each. If the root canals do not work,they'll have to pull his most important chewing teeth. The vet (who is a dental specialist) said that the injuries were directly related to this product. A $2000 bill and a pup with no molars. Sad day. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT"
1,"We purchase these dinosaurs constantly.  For some reason our dogs just LOVE them.  Unlike the Nylabone bones, these dinos last alot longer as well.  They are funky shapes so our dogs can manipulate them better to hold and chew.  If you have big chewers like my dogs (three lab mixes), I HIGHLY recommend these chews!"
0,"We purchased the Stegosaurus at a local pet store the day we adopted our cattle dog mix. At the time she was about 45 pounds and 8 months old. We did not know what kind of chewer she was, but felt that a product designed for ""powerful"" chewers up to 50 pounds would be a safe choice. It was not. She worked to remove the head and tail of the dino and while we were able to get the larger pieces from her, she swallowed several very small pieces. And much to our embarrassment, at her first vet visit (3 days after adoption) we were told to stop giving her whatever ""white plastic"" toy she was chewing and eating. Enough pieces had gotten into and through her system to cause the vet concern she may not pass all of them.<br /><br />I am giving this product 1 star because:<br />1) It is described as a product for powerful chewers - it did not hold up<br />2) It is rated for dogs up to 50 pounds - while on the upper end of the scale, our dog fits into that category and the product did not hold up<br />3) the vet warned us to stop using the product as the size and shape of the pieces were potentially harmful to our dog."
1,"This dinosaur lasts a long time - incredible with the way my dog chews.  And he doesn't seem to lose interest in it, no matter how raggedy it looks.  He likes the little knobbies on it because of the texture. He always finds where this thing is hidden and chomps away on it. I definitely recommend this dinosaur if you have a serious chewer."
0,"I wanted a Christmas gift my Pit Bull Terrier would love, so I got this dinosaur, something different from the regular bones. Long story short, we opened it on Saturday for Christmas, she chewed on it for a half an hour and started whining and excessively drooling. I looked in her mouth and saw she had fractured a canine tooth. My dog was in excruciating pain for two days because of the stupid shape of this bone. She was chewing on it's tail, and it literally broke a slab of her tooth off. The whole tooth had to be removed, costing me $300, and a day off work to get it fixed, not to mention all the pain and anxiety my dog went through. JUST STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!<br /><br />I've been giving my pitty the Nylabone brand chews since she was little. We've tried the Big Chews, Regular and Wolf size, and even the smaller ones and have never had a problem before this one. She loves the liver and bacon flavors, but I've been hesitant to give her any of these bones since our incident. She loves them though, and they keep her teeth clean."
1,"Our Silky Terrier is part dog/part pirana.  We bought a regular Nylabone and it was completely destroyed within a couple minutes.  Huge pieces were torn out of it and swallowed.  I was terrified he would have serious ramifications from it.  I contacted Nylabone immediately and they sent me 3 toys more suitable for my ""strong chewer"".  One of those was the dental dinosaur durables.  He LOVES LOVES LOVES this toy.  And after 4 months it is now time to replace it (the head and tail are now missing).  I am so please that this toy worked for our pirana dog! :)<br /><br />Other good toys that they sent as replacements were the Nylabone Wishbone and the Nylabone Puzzel Bone."
1,These are great if you have a pug. Spanky is 5 now and he has always had one. He just loves to spend time chewing his little dinosaur. Plus it really helps him keep with teeth clean. Highly remomeneded to pug owners.
1,"I have a pitbull 3years old and my wife has 2 pugs 7months and a 1 year old, they are all best friends. I bought the dental Dinosaur, because my pitbull will chew up any toy in 5 minutes and they were made of a very hard plastic.I am very amazed how long they have lasted and all 3 dogs love to chew on them."
0,"I have a number of Nylabones that are natural in color and 5 years old.  Our dog died 4 years ago and we kept the misc supplies.  Now we have a new lab and she loves the natural ones, which she basically wears down slowly.<br />We also had some white nylabones that hadn't been used and our lab almost eats them.  First we saw pieces about the size of 1/4 a rice in her feces.  Then I found her with a piece about the size of a dime in her mouth.  It was irregular and did not look like something that would pass easily.<br />We chucked the white ones and now I'm trying to find the good ones.<br />Not so easy since websites show pictures of both so I'm not certain what we'd get.<br /><br />I would never give my dog these white Nylabones.<br /><br />I did not buy Nylabones here.  I'm searching for a source of the good ones that don't break into large chunks.<br /><br />I asked for advice at the Nylabone site but have not heard from them."
1,"I was very disappointed in the ""regular"" Nylabones - my 20 pound dogs chewed them into sharp, dangerous chunks within a matter of minutes.  I was wary of Nylabone products after that, but the durable ones have turned out to be great, and I'll only buy durable from now on.  My dogs like the bone-shaped durable Nylabones, but they LOVE these dinosaurs.  They never seem to get tired of chomping on them.  They do wear down, but slowly and in tiny pieces that appear to be harmless.  After about a month of three dogs working on two dinosaurs, the toys are missing their heads, but there's plenty more to chew on.  Their irregular shape makes them easy to hold onto and fun to go at from different angles.  My house will never be without these things."
1,"My puppy is a yellow lab and he loooves his ""dino"" toy. He has had it since he was 2 months, is 6 months now, and chewed off the head, tail, and legs, and still is thrilled with it!! It's his #2 fav. toy! I would recommend it for anyone whith a large breed puppy/teenage dog."
0,"When I gave this to my dog he instantly went to town. As I sat and watched him I noticed the white t-rex had cut my dog's mouth from the sharp edges. He is an aggressive chewer and didn't want to see it go, but it really required too much supervision than I felt comfortable with."
0,My dogs had this chewed apart in the matter of 20 minutes and was eating off small parts. Not for dogs who are powerful chewers.
1,"I purchased 2 - one for each of our dogs. Unfortunately, I didn't realize how large/hard these chews are. Our dogs are chihuahua mix, and showed no interest in the dino-chews. They were too big and too ""strong"" of a chew for them. Luckily, my sister has a lab-mix, who seems to enjoy it thoroughly. These are really best for dogs that normally destroy their chewies within minutes. Otherwise, they are durable and cute."
1,"I have a Pit Bull Terrier and a Bulldog - both are very strong chewers.  There are very few toys on the market that they cannot destroy in minutes.  These chew toys are one of the rare exceptions and best of all, my dogs go bonkers when they get these toys.  Hours and hours of chewing enjoyment and they pick the dinosaur shaped bones over their regular Nylabones every time!  I think they especially love the unique shape and the bumps must be soothing on their gums.<br /><br />The only downside is that little tiny particles can break off - so you'll want to watch for that.  I suspect this wouldn't happen if you have a mild/medium strength chewer.  However, if you do have destructo-chewers like mine, know that the little specks that break off are no where big enough to be choking hazards - they just make a little mess on the carpet after a hour chewing session - so that means vaccumming after they're done chewing and removing the toy after it becomes unrecognizable as a dinosaur."
0,"I bought these for years for my little guys and they loved it.  Unbeknownst to me, it turns out these things will break and crack your dogs teeth!!!<br /><br />After a routine visit to the vet, he found one of my dogs had infected and broken back molars.  I guess it's a common occurrence judging by other reviewers on here.  And my vet also said he's had 8 dogs come in with the same problem in the last 2 years, all with Nylabone dental chew toys.<br />Had to get dental work done on my baby and her teeth were extracted.  Poor gal was crying all night long after surgery.  The vet says this happens w/ large dogs too!!!  So NYLABONE needs to stop selling this item as a dental chew!  I'm going to report this directly to Amazon corporate."
1,"These dinos are great for powerful chewers! Our dogs just LOVE them.  Our dogs have also worked the head, legs, and tail off, but still are actively grinding away at them.  They last quite a long time too, which is a major bonus.  I highly recommend these to anyone with dogs who love to chew!"
1,These dental dinosaurs are the best dog toy that I've found.  My lab is an aggressive chewer and a dinosaur can last about 30 days as a full fledged looking dinosaur.  She continues to chew the toy until all you can see is a small unidentifiable circle for a few years.  Both of my dogs prefer the T-Rex the best.  Second choice of theirs is the Stegosaurus.  I wholeheartedly recommend this toy for any aggressive chewer.
1,"This dino is my dog's favorite toy.  They love the shape and the taste.  It's easy to hold in thier small dachshund paws, and because of the odd shape there are many angles to choose from.  Nylabone is a fabulous company that cares greatly about customer service - email them and you'll see!  They are so friendly and wonderful, we'll be customers for life!"
1,"My dog loves this dinosaur, hes an 11lb chihuahua terrier mix and is a tough little chewer so this is perfect. I ordered this thinking I was going to get three 'assorted' dinosaurs but you actually only get one hence only 4 stars. I ended up with the stegasaurus which my doggie loves so I highly recommend this chew toy as it works a treat but remember, YOU ONLY GET ONE!"
0,"I was so excited for this product, it's the first toy I've bought my new rescue dog. However, the Dinosaur Dental Chew was chewed and mangled within the first 20 minutes...I thought they were supposed to non-edible...he's seems to have been able to eat the non-edible ""durable"" toy though :("
1,"On that warm July day when I first opened the recently arrived cardboard box of mystery, I was deeply saddened and upset when the dinobone I purchased was in fact a Stegasaurus and not the advertised T-Rex.<br /><br />What would my dog think? Surely ALL HUMANS AND ANIMALS are well aware that the Stegasaurus comes nowhere near the badassness of a T-Rex. Would my dog like it? Would it chew on its nylony stega-carcus?<br /><br />Yes."
0,"I purchased these because I thought they were safe for my dog.  I was horribly mistaken.  My dog cracked two of his teeth, chewing on this.  I heard the crack and saw the blood on the bone.  I took him to the vet and he had to have two cracked teeth removed.  This product should not even be on the market.  Had we not caught this, the vet told me, that there is no warning for a tooth infection and dogs can easily die.  Do not buy this product.  I cannot believe that the company continues to market this.  This product is hurting the dogs.  It was a very hefty dental bill and I haven't even addressed what my dog went through having to be put under and not have a major molar to chew his regular dog food."
1,"My dogs have a variety of Nylabones and one from Hartz as well and they all get chewed on depending on what my boys are in the mood for.  They regularly compete to be the one to get dinosaur, so I would rank that as this one being a favorite.  Both my dogs are heavy chewers, but the nylabones seem to last a good long while and they never get tired of them.  One other thing, the dinosaur (with all the little nubs) is probably the most horrible thing to step on when making a trip to the bathroom in the middle of the night!"
1,"My two dogs looove this thing. The only wierd thing was that I was expecting a T-rex and got a Stegasaurus. This isn't really a complaint, but just a heads up. If you want the T-rex, you might need to specify. It doesn't look like the same material as other Nylabone products I've bought. It seems a little harder than other bones we've bought. Doesn't make a difference to the dogs. They never get tired of it."
1,"I am one of those people that spoil their dogs. I have 5. lol. I hated that my chihuahuas had all these favorite toys and that my pit bull would tear them without trying. I started the search for a toy that he'd enjoy and not be able to totally destroy. He is almost 3 years old now and this is the ONLY toy that I can give him that doesn't get destroyed or choked on. He loves it. I leave it in his kennel (where he sleeps and stays while I'm at work) and you can only see one or two teeth marks on the thing. It's been in his kennel for over two months and he chews it all the time. He falls asleep chewing and is soooo cute. But yeah. Pit owners, no lie, BEST toy ever. And CHEAP compared to the other things that I've gotten him over the years. I've spent way more on dollar tree plushies that he's gone through in a matter of hours. (AND he is a big headed, big mouthed boy, but the way the dino is shaped he cannot swallow it like he has done with whole bones. I would never leave it with him if there were ANY danger so, no worries.)"
1,"My border collie is an aggressive chewer (although not aggressive with anything else!). These dinos are the only toys that will keep him occupied that he can't destroy in hours. The dinos last for a couple months for him, but he grinds them down so they become a bit of a hazard if you step on them. His teeth are healthy and clean with seldom brushing. He hasn't had any issues with them- we give him 2 at a time so if he's bored with one he can play with another. They shouldn't replace dental care, but they really do help with plaque."
1,"These chews are great. My dachshund-mix 3-month-old puppies were not too interested in the classic nylabone so I got these, and they just LOOOVE them. It's their #1 chew-toy. They can sit in their beds and chew on it forever. I also recommend the Nylabone fish. For some reason the funky shapes and textures are just much more enticing than the regular bone shape. One more note: to get them really hooked on Nylabones I've found that I have to hold the toy for them to chew on at first (so they build really positive associations with it: bone='mom'), at the beginning of a chewing session, and then they're hooked. Don't necessarily expect your dog to just chew it without any of your involvement. The more you're involved, the more he'll enjoy it!"
1,"We could never give my dog anything cloth like or soft because she would chew on it or take out the stuffing of her bed or blanket. With toys it was the same. We bought her a Kong(r) but she didn't take to it even with several treats stuffed on the inside. Then I bought this hoping it would be a good toy for her. She didn't take to it right away but eventually it became her favorite. Anytime she's bored or just need to chew we'll give her this and she'll be busy for about ten minutes. The toy itself is very tough not flexible at all which is what we needed. Its easy to clean too, we just run it under some hot water for a couple of seconds or so. Great for bored dogs or some really aggressive chewers. The only thing is I didn't get to pick the dinosaur...darn!... but that's not going to affect it's rating it's still a great chew toy overall."
1,This is the only chew toy that consistently holds my dogs' attention.  And it's good for their gums and teeth.  I stock up on them every year.
1,"I have two golden retrievers and 5 Nylabone dinosaurs in the house - at least temporarily, for the dinosaurs that is.  These are, paws down, the absolute favorite chew toy in our house.  They are easy for the dogs to handle, carry around, fling around and chew.  I might as well order a gross for the upcoming year."
0,He will not even touch it and he will eat everything. I am very disappointed. I bought several nylabone products for my dog and he does not like any of them.
0,"This has to be one of the most disappointing dog bone purchases i have made.  This is a bone that is recommended for strong chewers, something that is required for my dog.  Unfortunately, he had the head off of the t-rex within 10 minutes, and he swallowed it before i could get it away from him.  From now on, it's all about durability, and nothing about looks.  If your dog is a heavy chewer, be wary of this product!"
1,Would definately purchase again.  Has held up well to two 75+ pound lab mixes that are very powerful chewers.  Great price too!
0,"I have a 3 year old english/american bulldog mix that loves chewing on nylabones/dingos. I bought this product selfishly, because I like dinosaurs. Unfortunately, the littel nubs tore into her gums like nobody's business and left sharp shards sticking out. She only had it for a short time under (sort of laxed) supervison, but when i looked down the thing's entire tail was covered in blood. Into the trash it went. Moving forward, I will stick to the non-nubby nylabones."
1,Durable and a lot of fun for our god. Would recommend to everyone. It also is good for dogs teeth. Much cheaper than buying at store.
1,My high-energy puppy loves this dinosaur chew toy.  I feel it's soothing on his sharp puppy teeth.  He always seems to grab this toy in his basket of toys.  Highly recommend!
0,Bought this because it said durable and my dog uses other nylabones and I've had luck with them lasting me a short while. This wasn't the case she had the head and tail chewed off before I knew it. In less than an hour it was missing both ends. I'll have to go back to the wishbone because she takes longer to wear those down. Keep in mine my dog is a very strong chewer she can destroy things quickly so if your dog isn't a hard core chewer it might be ok for you but otherwise try something without small ends.<br /><br />EDIT- Just got worse had to call the vet due to bloody stool and this is the only thing I can think of that caused it
1,My 30+ pound mixed breed puppy is a voracious chewer and she LOVES this toy.  I'm ordering more of them today - don't ever want her to be without!!!
1,This is a great size. My 60lb Lab/Shepherd mix carries it around and chews on it.<br />Very happy with my purchase.
1,"Our 4 dogs just love these, they love them so much that they only last about a month or so before I have to toss them and buy new ones because they have turned them all into shanks and our dogs use them as weapons unknowingly against my husband and I!"
1,"Both of my dogs (black lab / husky mix) enjoy the Nylabone Dinosaurs.  When one settles down to chew on a dinosaur, I have to find the other one for the other dog or she will look at her sister with envy and try to take the dinosaur away from her.  I can give them a dinosaur as a substitute for chewing on the furniture.  I will certainly buy this product again."
1,"My dog Cotton is an aggressive chewer she could chew her way through anything within seconds & then she's looking for something else to chew. She's a 3yr old Coton de Tulear a rare breed which are in the bichon family My dog is very hyper & has nervous energy she doesn't know what to do with, I thought getting her a chew toy would keep her busy for a while, but they didn't even last for a day. I went on line and read reviews from other's reviews on different chew toys, when I read the reviews for this dinosaur chew and read their had the same issues my dog had and their dogs were a lot bigger & weighed more then my dog is small& weighs 15 lbs. I thought this chew would be a perfect chew toy & it would last for a longer period it has lasted & she is still chewing on it after 4 months. This is going to be a second dinosaur chew I am buying for her as a backup. She loves this toy and I would recommend this for those pet owners who have dogs who are heavy aggressive chewers this will last a long  time. I love it and I save money& no longer need to buy any other chew toy but this dinosaur chew.<br />Suzan Mesquite NV"
1,This dino bone has been a great chew toy. I'm not so sure about the dental aspect. I haven't noticed any difference in the plaque buildup. It has saved some of the kid's toys by keeping the dog busy so it was a good purchase.
1,"I am a long-time dog trainer and rescuer. I've owned all the versions of this indispensible toy! The Stegosaurus version held up - for years! - through Australian Cattle Dog, Border Collie, English Staffordshire Terrier, and Irish Wolfhound puppies. They even chewed on them as they got older.  I wouldn't recommend Tyrannosaurus (too many gaps to crunch on) and Brontosaurus (the tail eventually breaks off) if you have dogs like mine who have huge jaws and teeth the size of my thumb. If a toy lasts at my house it truly is almost undestructible.<br /><br />As with any toy, don't leave your pup alone with it until you've watched to see they can safely chew it. Do examine it regularly to make sure there are no cracks. Unlike most Nylabone bone-shaped toys, my dogs prefered the shape and texture of these. I usually start them off by rubbing a bit of peanut butter into the nubs the first time. After that the dogs carry them around while teething.  Best of all, they wash up great in the dishwasher!"
0,"I received this product in the mail yesterday. It was a different dino than pictured, but the description notes that it pay be. My dog (a 35 lb beagle/lab) chewed most of it up by last night. Other Nylabone products are fine for him, but this one doesn't look like it will last long. Also, it is a lot smaller than I anticipated."
1,"This is my dogs favorite toy. They have a lot, but this one just drives them crazy. I love the texture, it helps keeping their teeth clean."
1,This dog toy has been a huge hit at my house. I just added a bulldog puppy to my family and if he is awake his teeth are constantly seeking something to sink into. This toy is hard enough to hold up but not so hard he loses interest. The irregular shapes are great for giving him multiple chew spots on this toy. This dinosaur has even brought out the puppy in my 8yr old mix that was never big on chew toys.<br />Can't go wrong with this one!
1,This is great for a heavy chewer.  Long lasting and the dogs just love it. This is the second one we have purchased and it seems it will be the only one for while to come.
0,"I had ordered this expecting a slightly bigger toy considering it was a ""x-large"" toy. This toy is great for small dogs like poodles or something like that, but this was too small for my dog (average size mixed/mutt dog) and the head lasted one day before that was gone. Very disappointed considering I have alot of good to say about nylabone products. Hope to see a better/bigger dinosaur toy soon."
1,"With two pit-mix dogs, finding durable chew toys has been a challenge.  They can demolish most toys marked as durable in a matter of minutes.  They LOVE these dino toys.  I think it may be the odd shape that makes these some of their favorites, but they seem to like gnawing down the various angles to these.  These last several months before they become too small and are discarded.  Any time we find one of these from under the couch that was long forgotten, they eye each other and run to steal the toy the second the other leaves it alone.  These have become a regular purchase for us to keep our dogs happy, entertained, and chewing on the right things!"
1,"Okay, I had to speak up. Hello, common sense and directions on toys. ONE) choose a toy that is large enough to encourage dogs to chew using their side/back teeth. You DO NOT want a toy that is small enough for dogs to use their front teeth or likely they will crack their front teeth, ect. So even if the toy says is is meant for large dogs, pay attention to how your dog chews on it. If they're chewing with their front teeth, take it away and try the next size up. TWO) Yes, toys sometimes do say for powerful chewers. If your dog is tearing off large chunks of the toy, TAKE IT AWAY. DO NOT LET YOUR DOG KEEP IT THEN ACT SURPRISED THAT YOUR DOG IS HAVING DIGESTION PROBLEMS. Nylabone toys are meant for dogs to take off tiny slivers at a time, no bigger than a grain of rice. I don't care what ""strength the chew toy is"", if it's not strong enough for you dog, take it away and try a larger/tougher toy.<br /><br />All of this is common sense, but in case that escaped you, it's also on the directions."
1,This is a great toy for dogs that chew up everything else.  I have a little Cheagle (Chihuahua and Beagle mix) and she literally eats all her other toys.  This is one of the only toys that she's yet to destroy and she loves it!  She carries it around everywhere with her.  I got the T-Rex and it's the cutest thing :)
1,My dog loves this little dinosaur!! I'm going to buy more in different shapes too :) I def recommend this! He's a tough chewer and this lasted a long time.
1,My dog LOVES this chey toy.  She's ALWAYS willing to sit down and relax with this chew toy when I pull it out for her.
1,I bought the Nylabone dinosaur chew toy for my 80lb. Greyhound and instead my 20lb Bichon has taken charge of it.  He chews on it several times a day.  The Greyhound doesn't stand a chance getting to it!
1,"My dog is a pretty intense chewer - and is about 19 lbs.  He has the T. Rex and loves it.  (It's pretty funny to see him stand it up just to bite it on the head.) This toy is only for chewing though - it's pretty dense, so it can't be involved in any ""play.""  We haven't had any health issues and he's chewed for 6 months now (our T. Rex no longer has a head or tail) so I think he's probably in the clear."
1,"I purchased this bone for my dog last Christmas and it is still one of her favorites! I believe we got the 'brontosaurus' model. She is an Australian Shepherd (about 35 lbs) and is extremely rough on her toys. We are lucky if a toy lasts more than 1 day, but this one is still going strong. I think its tail is just about gone by now, but other than that, it is still in tact. We call it her ""dino"" and she knows it by name. If we tell her to go get her dino, she brings it to us every time without fail. I think I only paid about $4 for it at the time, but I would still buy it at $7.50. It's still much cheaper than nylabones at the store! It is the perfect size for my dog, but I wouldn't recommend it for a dog much larger than her."
1,"My teething puppy loves this toy.  The nubs that protrude all over the toy are wonderful on his gums.  It it smaller than I thought and my large breed puppy has outgrown it before his teething phase is over.  I still let him chew on it, but only when he is supervised."
1,"I have a dog with very strong jaws. She's only thirty-five pounds but she goes through most toys like they're bubblegum. Even as a small puppy, she would destroy anything and everything. By the age of five or six months we had to give up on soft and rope toys altogether, and at a year old, she is limited to only hard chews like Kong, Nylabone, etc. Even then, she destroys most of these with relative ease. She's gone through chews others have recommended as long-lasting in literally ten minutes. The only toy she has that has lasted more than a month or so is her original red Kong, which she mostly licks instead of chews.<br /><br />I initially bought the dinosaur for my other, less toy-murderous dog, but the power chewer quickly stole it from him. She was in love. She carried it everywhere and chewed on it constantly. I'm not sure if it's the shape or the texture she likes, or some combination thereof, but whatever the case, it instantly became her favorite. Even the most durable hard toys normally only last a few weeks with her, but her dino is going on two or three months now. It's chewed beyond recognition, all the nubs worn down, and it's very rapidly nearing the end of its life because little bits of plastic are falling off, but it still lasted far longer than most toys do. A few weeks ago I bought her a second one, in a different shape, and she's equally as enamored with it. All in all, it's not going to be indestructible if you have a power chewer, but it certainly lasts a heck of a lot longer than most!"
1,"I have a 15 month old puppy who is a powerful and destructive chewer.  I discovered Nylabone toys a few years ago when my cocker spaniel, who was an anxious chewer, had to have intestinal surgery to remove parts of a rubber toy.  When I got this puppy I gave her a stuffed animal and 5 minutes later I had to throw its remains away.  She has been a Nylabone girl ever since. She loves her dinosaur; she carries it everywhere with her and even sleeps with it.  It no longer has a recognizable head but she did not manage to chew off any large chunks, just little bits.  The downfall is that I find a lot of little rice sized bits of dinosaur in the furniture and her blankets; the up side is I know there are no big chunks of toy ending up in her intestines.<br /><br />I highly recommend this and other Nylabone ""for powerful chewers"" type toys to anyone whose dog is a little chew crazy. I also recommend buying from Amazon because the price is about half of what it is in the pet store and the selection is much better than discount stores have. At the price for these dinosaurs I am getting ready to order a few more so that when the one we have is worn out I have another readily on hand.<br /><br />For reference my dog is an oversized Jack Russell Terrier (around 30lbs) and this toy is the perfect size for her."
1,Oh dino...what would we do without you!! Our lab puppy absolutely loves this toy and it has been one of her favorites. I was so excited to find this toy on Amazon because our poor dino has taken a beating. This is one of the first toys we purchased for our beloved pup when we adopted her in March and haven't been able to find it in the local stores. This doy has survived her teething phase and we thought it was time to get a 2nd in case dino decides to hide under the couch again.
1,"I have two dogs, one is a heavy chewer.  Both dogs love this toy and will take turns stealing it from each other.  It has held up well, even when my heavy chewer gets ahold of it.  I wasn't sure it would hold up well because it is a bit thin and has pieces that stick out, like the foot and head, but it has held up surprisingly well."
1,"We received the Brontosaurus for our 20 lb. 4 month old chow/retriver/coonhound/corgi mix pup.  It is by and large her favorite toy. She spends a good amount of time chewing on it and is a moderate chewer. She hasn't gotten any pieces off of it and there hasn't been any damage to her teeth. The only thing is that it's so hard, I don't think it gives her a lot of relief for her teething."
1,"I like many others who've written in, have tried many different ""indestructible"" chew toys only to find that our little beast will gnaw through them in minutes.  I must say, this Dinosaur Chew Toy has outlasted any previous toy by miles.  He's been at it every day for 3 weeks for an hour or two at a time and it's probably reduced in size by 20%.  It's not going to last forever, but it's certainly better than anything else out there that we've found.  Great item!"
1,"My husband and I foster Australian Cattle Dogs and own one ourselves. With our most recent litter of puppies they were unable to do any damage to this toy! (That's a huge improvement over some of the other toys we bought them). Once the puppies were gone, I gave it to my destroyer-of-all-toys. After about a month of carrying it around and chewing on it, he has only managed to sever the head of the T-rex, which makes this the champion of toys in our household!<br /><br />I give this toy four stars just because I wouldn't recommend it for every dog-- it's rock hard and can definitely do some damage. If, however, you have a power chewer and are desperate for a toy that won't easily fall apart, I would definitely suggest this product."
0,"My dog loved chewing on this dinosaur toy but after a couple of months he managed to finely shred it to the point that about 20% of it was missing/ingested. It didn't seem to cause any digestive problems but was disconcerting nonetheless. We've had better luck with another Nylabone product, the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGMGG"">Double Action Combo Bone Chew Toy</a>, which is still going strong after 4+ years."
1,"My sister bought this for her 2 weims who are both aggressive chewers. I've never seen toys destroyed so fast! They both LOVE this toy and it lasts quite awhile.  I decided to buy one for my husky. It's one of his favorites often played with. It is a hard thick plastic toy with some weight to it. My dog and my sister's dogs, they all have chewed the crap out of it to the point it doesn't look like a dinosaur anymore! Oh and they constantly carry it around with them and drop it on your toes. Ummm yeah OUCH!<br /><br />The one drawback (and warning) of this toy is that the teeth marks left in it can cause sharp or rough edges. Some fragments are chewed off and left on the floor.  However, I still give it 5 stars or should I say 5 paws!!! I already bought a 2nd one to keep on hand once I'm ready to throw the old one in the trash."
1,"I have Boston Terriers that destroy every toy they get their paws on, even ones made for ""tough chewers"".  These dental dinos are the best things EVER!!!  They don't last forever, but at least I feel I'm getting my moneys worth.  I highly recommend these"
1,Got this for my golden who chew everything and he has not been able to destroy this as yet!  Plus it is good for his teeth and massages his gums.
1,Ordered this Naylabone for a strong chewer!! It is holding up pretty well and is greatly enjoyed! This is a much better cost then I can find at any of the pet stores around our area.
1,"My dog is a 25 lb Schnoodle who just turned 1 year old last month.  I have struggled to find a toy that she won't destroy within 2 minutes.  This is a great product!  She loves her little Dino and takes it with her everywhere.  It's a great alternative to her pigs foot that had a horrible smell.  Also, she can chew on this 24/7 and I don't have to worry about her getting sick from over feeding her on rawhides.  My only regret: My husband bought it in the store for $11.00.  Our next one will be purchased on Amazon."
1,"My dogs absolutely love these dinosaurs! Initially I thought they liked them only because they were knew, but the excitement lasts! I have two 40 lb dogs, average chewers I would say, and two of these dinos will last them a 3-4 months. They are super durable, just beware of sharp edges as they begin to wear down, but that is with all dog chews. I have looked into buying these in the store instead of online, but they seemed to be priced more in the store, around $12 where I live, so Amazon's price is pretty good!"
1,"I got this for my Labrabull, who is an aggressive 3 month old. I got the stagisaurus in the mail (wish I got the TRex :/). My dog loves it, pulls it out of his toy bin and just lays and bites non-stop. However, this isn't super durable. The first day he had it, within maybe an hour it had visible signs of being chewed on, so be careful if your dog is an aggressive chewer."
1,We've bought all sorts of Nylabone chew toys from rings to bones to the tree stick to these dinosaurs. This T-Rex is by far my girl's favorite. It's easy to hold and chew. My girl is a chihuahua/terrier mix. She has chewed down to the t-rex arms on both of her bones. I buy back-ups because only 1 place in town sells them. If they sell out then I'll be buying them here on Amazon.
1,"My wife's dog love these bones.  We started buying these from amazon for the price as my mutt, who had to re-define what power-chewer means as she destroys black kongs and lacrosse balls, started destroying these as well.  They provide at least a month of entertainment for our pups and we buy 2-4 at a time."
1,"I have a puggle who chews all of the time, and she has been through a variety of Nylabone products, all of which she absolutely loved.  I am a huge fan of anything Nylabone, and when I saw this one, I immediately had to get it for her because not only did it look like something she would love, but the design promotes good dental health.  She has had it for a month now, and she is constantly chewing on it.  Not only has it helped to keep her teeth clean, but it is much more durable than other Nylabone toys.  She chews it every day, carries it around and drops it all over the place, and it has barely worn at all. I highly recommend this toy for dogs who love to chew!<br /><br />I do have to share one negative to this toy though.... if your dog likes you to ""tug"" with them for their toys, this one isn't for you.  It hurts to grab and pull on it.  Not much of a negative, but I want to give a fair review, so if you are looking for a strong tug toy, go with a smooth surfaced large Nylabone and save your hands some pain :)"
1,"my dog loves this toy. she would chew on it until she falls asleep!!! wherever she goes, her dino goes! she loves her dino!"
1,Out of all the nylabones I have purchaced the dogs seem to have some special attachment to the dinosaur.  I know I have recently seen a nub of him around here somewhere.  I have all pitties and nylabone seems to be the only brand that they cant destroy in a day.  The yellow ribbed ring Nylabone is the only one standing after months.  They have barely put dent marks in it.
1,My dog is thrilled with this.  He is a chewing machine being only 1 1/2 years old and this hasn't even had a dent put in it.
1,"The ""stick"" Nylabone was their favorite until we got the T. Rex.  I told my wife she was nuts for getting it but they love it.  Guess we'll have to try the other dino one also.  It's funny how they'll go after one spot.  On this one it's the tail.  With the regular shaped bones they'll make one end look like it went through a wood chipper and the other end looks like you just opened it."
1,This toy dinosaur become so loved he was named Frank. My two collies love gnawing on him and not household goods. The pups have almost chewed it smooth! We will be ordering a new one shortly.
1,We have three dobermans and a bulldog and this is great.  The raised bumps must feel so good bc I won't even attempt to take it away.  I highly recommend this product for chewers.  You could get a a little blood from the gums but the dogs love it.
1,I gave this to my Akita for his birthday and he absolutely loved it! I would definitely buy one of these again. They are great for teething puppies.
1,"I've always had good luck with Nylabone products.  My dogs absolutely LOVE this one, though.  I think breaking away from the bone shape that they are used to really stirred their interest.  Can't beat the price you get online, either.  I'm sure this would be twice as much at a pet store."
1,"4 Stars for wheat and corn free product. However, I agree with the other August comment.  Better to buy local, since product tends to get damaged easily.  ALSO, prices on Amazon are very high.  $6.50 in local stores versus product price and shipping on line.  Whole Food carries the cookies, and you can ask your local health food store to try and stock it.  Good luck!"
0,These cookies were stale. At least half the foil packets were slightly open and broken in a million small pieces. I love this brand of cookie but the orange essence flavor isn't available where I buy them so decided to order these online. My advice is stick to buying them from local source.
1,"We recently moved to an area and there are no good Thai restaurants.  Everywhere I have gone, I always ask for peanut sauce and have gotten everything from a spicy red oily sauce to a sweet oily (chunky) kind of sauce. This can is just like what we used to get in our favorite Thai places.  I highly recommend this product!"
1,"Just received these flavoring oils, had to immediately try them out! They smell and taste wonderful. They seem much stronger than most kinds you find at the store so a little goes a long way! The bottles are good quality and clearly labeled. None of flavors taste or smell artificial like some types normally do. I really recommend these. There are many unique and hard to find flavors listed, I haven't tried them all yet but I plan to!"
1,"I love these oils. They can take anything, even plain oatmeal, and transform it into a delicious ""gourmet"" delicacy. Plus the 10-pack of individually chosen flavors is the best of both worlds--the only bad part is having to choose between all the wonderful options! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product and the service from the company was spectacular; the oils got here so quickly and in perfect condition. Thank you!"
1,"WOW, I really like the value of these extracts.  I will definitely buy some more.  I had specific flavors when I ordered the first time since I like to add cinnamon oil to my bake goods and even some mixes that I make for drinks.  I will look into other flavors and order again...thanks!  It's really hard to find them around here when it's not Christmas time."
1,"This is a great deal for Vapers that want to try DIY for the first time. I have been mixing about 1 dram per 25ml of vegetable glycerin (no nicotine) just for fun to see what flavors I like and if it tastes as good as some basic e-liquid flavors I have tried. I must point out that this review is for people 18 years or older who have switched to vaping from smoking and want to try DIY liquid without committing a lot of money. This 10 pack plus a 5 dollar bottle of VG from wally mart is a great way to get your feet wet and if you make a mistake it's no big deal because of how inexpensive all the materials are. But be careful as not all the flavors are water soluble. Do some research and try to get flavors that are mostly made up of propylene glycol....Apple, Cherry and Blueberry are all good examples of this. Avoid Almond and Wintergreen. Vaping forums have complete lists for the flavors that are ok to vape."
1,"We started this protein powder diet called almased, and while the flavor wasn't horrible, it needed a boost.  I chose this listing because they let you choose your flavors.  The peanut butter is FANTASTIC.  I do approx 5-7 drops in my shake.  All the flavors are exactly what you'd expect from a candy oil.  The watermelon is just like the watermelon jolly rancher and so on.  Great sellers.  Thank you!  Will order again."
1,"I had hiatal hernia surgery August 27 and could not eat solid food so I ordered these flavorings to add to my unflavored protien powder. I didn't want to add calories or sugar to my drinks. The peanut butter is so good! It smells just like a peanut butter cookie! Banana Creame is really BANANA(Y)! I didn't need to add a banana to the shake! Blueberry is delicious! I added it to unflavored greek yogurt and milk with a sprinkle of sugar alternative and I had a blueberry shake! I would recommend these flavorings to any person who really doesn't know if they would like the flavor of some already prepared protien powders. I really didn't like the super sweet taste of NECTAR so I use unflavored protein and the LoAnn oils. I much happier now and I drink my protein shakes the way I want them to taste!Plus, I've lost weight on the high protein diet!"
1,"I discovered LorAnn candy oils years ago when I got into making hard candies. Recently I have started making xylitol hard candies and needed more flavorants and these oils are still wonderful and they arrived in just 2 days with free shipping and that's without the Amazon Super Savers!<br /><br />Unlike sucrose {table sugar} hard candies, xylitol candies {atleast the ones I make} need to crystallize with the proper crystal structure so as not to be crumbly or a syrupy goo. This means not all flavorings will work AND you cannot add very much so what you use needs to be very strong and LorAnn oils are AWESOME!!!<br /><br />Right now my only regret is I should have gone with the 24pack but there will definitely be a next time!"
1,Received them so fast. Some flavors are stronger than others but overall really like the variety they have going! Bigger bottles would be good for me since I have a business.
1,"I've always been a fan of playing with flavoring oils, and this variety pack makes having a little collection of your own super easy. I've used mine with making my own jello, flavoring icings, adding to drinks, and candy making. The flavors are wonderful and pretty true to what they're representing. A great buy for any kitchen scientist."
1,"My eleven month old daughter loves her Earth's Best puree foods; most importantly, I like the fact that we are able to introduce our little one's taste buds with a variety of fruits and vegetables and an appetite for healthy, organic meals."
1,I bought this Earth's Best Dinner and Vegetable Variety Pack for my friend's baby and he seems to like it a lot.  I tried the squash flavor and it tasted pretty good.  I'd get it again. For the baby of course.
1,My daughter loves the dinner combos we are still trying out the veggies but the dinner ones she loves.  This is a great deal but you can get a better deal at babies r us if you can catch a sale and if they have the shelves fully stocked which is not often as this brand goes fast in that store.
1,"My son loves earth's best baby food. He gobbles it down like it is candy. The consistency of the food is usually pretty good, with the ""dinner"" meals being more thick."
0,We eat a variety of foods and my daughter did not like the dinners at all.  The flavours come out diluted and therefore don't taste particularly like anything in the meal.
1,my son loves this brand!! has great variety!! noting compares to it!! def get it on save and subscribes you can get it way cheaper than in stores!!!
1,"Everything about this product was excellent!  I loved the net bag, the pirate doubloons looked perfect and the chocolate was delicious.  My daughter's bridal shower was not only original (a pirate bridal shower) but the favors left a lasting memory.  Thank you!"
1,"I am in love with this chocolate.  Does it taste like Caramel?  No--it's better.  More complex.  And better for you to boot.<br /><br />If you haven't tried this, you should.<br /><br />I tried it because I've switched to primal/paleo eating and I don't think I could go back to regular commercial chocolate after this!"
1,"Remarkable, in my view, taste. But most importantly, it's a raw organic product with great nutritional value. Get one bar in the morning, and chances are you won't need any coffee. It packs a lot of energy for me. Worth a try for you I think."
1,"A luscious layer of ""caramel"" sandwiched between two velvety smooth layers of fine raw cacao.  As soon as you bite into this bar you'll be captivated by the contrasting textures and flavors that compliment each other to perfection.  Comes complete with nutrients and a long lasting energetic mood lift.  The wondrous world of raw vegan food just got a little better."
1,"I admit it...I love most of the Rightously Raw bars. But this is my favorite! And yeah, yeah...it doesn't taste exactly like caramel. But come on! That's like expecting soy milk to taste exactly like cow's milk! Not gonna happen. I think the folks at Rightously Raw got this one...well...right. The filling has a richness & depth that are reminiscent of caramel, the chocolate is superb, and you can enjoy it with total peace of mind. I'll take that any day over a sugar-bomb of ""real"" caramel!"
1,"What an interesting treat! Yes, you may feel the flavor of raw cacao, but this aspect is mild, and you may not even notice it if you don't focus on it. What you are more likely to notice is how elegantly it's crafted in terms of mouthfeel (both the chocolate itself and the combination of the chocolate and the filling). I think this product is a masterpiece, taste-wise and texture-wise. The only obstacles for my family to buying from this brand often are the price and the presence of some added sugar (relatively little though, judging by the numbers on their labels; I just wanted to point out that agave nectar is especially high in fructose, the ""worst"" of ""simple sugars"", and this brand uses some agave nectar - hopefully very little). This brand's other bars, Acai and ""Caramel"", are similar, but ""Maca"" is NOT chocolaty and disappointing."
0,"At first we thought the bar was damaged by heat... or was too old (despite exp. date saying otherwise). A few months later we bought it again (from a different store) - same problem. And now (especially since another reviewer had the same problem) I think this MACA bar is designed to be like that. It's NOT chocolaty. It tastes and looks like something else. It may satisfy a sweet tooth, but it's not worth the price. Their other 3 flavors taste fabulous (Acai, Goji, ""Caramel""). Not the healthiest though, due to some added sugar."

It's delicious, just don't expect that dairy flavor.<br />This brand's other bars, Acai and Goji, are similar, but ""Maca"" is NOT chocolaty and disappointing."
1,I've had a LOT of raw chocolate bars. Nothing compares to this brand. I've tried all the different flavors and they're to LIVE for. I feel really healthy after eating some of this chocolate. I would recommend buying it at a local health food store because they're quite expensive to order here. I have the same thing to say about their other flavors.
0,"I read some glowing reviews on blogs of these bars and decided to try this one as it was considered the ""best tasting"" by many.<br /><br />The outer chocolatre itself is good, but the ""caramel truffle"" had a quite unpleasant taste that I did not like at all. After two bites it ended in the garbage. Oh well...<br /><br />For now I'll stick to Lindt 85% Cacao bars which are cheap and meet my needs of a very low sugar chocolate treat."
0,"I do not even know where to start, horrible texture, grainy, sweet, no flavor...<br />Is there really chocolate in it? If i did not live so far from the store I would have<br />taken it back, did I say overpriced? I would not even try the other flavors, yuck!"

0,"These were selling in my gym and I decided to try this and the Caraeml (which I reviewed separately and gave two stars).<br /><br />I managed to eat two bites of the caramel. I spat out the first bite of this one. It tastes disgusting. Furthermore, despite it not being passed its sell-by-date (two months from now) it looks bad. The caramel bar looks like dark chocolate; this looks like medium brown sand.<br /><br />Definitely the worst chocolate I've ever had (and in a world full of Hershey's that is saying something)."
0,"This was an impulse buy while standing in line at an organic foods market. First off, I have to say that I've had raw chocolate before, and I really like dark chocolate. So after a surprising cost of $5 I was hoping for the best tasting sweet to ever hit me in the mouth. Wow, I just have to say that this was so awful that I feel like I have to warn the world. I was a little disappointed in the small size of it at first, but now I understand that no one could stand to eat one of these if they were full sized. For one, the ""caramel"" is an unflavored paste-like substance  , and the only way I can describe the whole eating experience is by likening it to having a pill get stuck in the back of your throat and being stuck with that rancid flavor until you manage to eat something less horrible. As I sit here in my buyers remorse stupor, I can't stop thinking about the many more pleasing things I could have done with my $5. For instance, I could go bowling, tip a stripper, wash my car, or buy 2 or 3 less disgusting chocolate bars. I'm only righting this review in the hopes that I may keep some other poor unsuspecting shopper from being duped as I was."
1,I like that these come in individual packages. It's great for kid's snack in their lunch box. It's just the right size. The larger bumblebar packets are too big for kids. Amazon is the only place that I could find these in chocolate flavor.
1,I love the seasame seeds and soybeans combined with chocolate.  These are very handy to have in your purse for a quick snack when you are out!
1,"I ordered these for my grandkids, who like sweet snacks but have food allergies. Their Mom has been cooking gluten free but needed some quick snacks - they loved them."
1,"Over the years I have always enjoyed sesame candies. This tastes so delicious,both the chocolate and sesame flavors come through clearly. A well balanced blend of textures also."
0,Here is a healthy bar which was sticky in texture. I was afraid it would pull out dental work.  Hard to chew.  May have tasted smoother if were eaten in warm climate!  Will not re-order.
0,"The Thai yellow bean paste pictured is not the brand that was sent.  In fact, not sure what was sent was bean paste because the label is totally in a forign language.  We are very familiar with the brand that is pictured becasue we buy it locally in the Aisian MArkets.<br /><br />The brand sent was not the brand advertised in the photo"
1,"This is a very good product, has just enough spice to wake up your mouth. The company sent it timely and packed to prevent breakage."
1,Darling Sprinkle Mix. I made a chocolate cake this weekend and put the red sprinkles in the shape of a heart. People really liked the texture of the sprinkles. Sweetheart mix can be used year around.
1,"Cute and they taste good, but I found it disappointing that 3/6 of the cells were just coloured sugar... Still though, I'd recommend it. It's a cute buy and not even just limited to V-day; I just used them to make cute birthday cupcakes for a friend and she loved them! :)"
1,"My dogs love this food, they think it is a treat lol. Just wish I could afford the big bags for them."
1,this selection of chocolates are simply fabulous and i do hope they will be available again as soon as possible.  I want to give this selection as a gift to the many chocolate lovers I know.
1,"We prize individuality in wines and coffees, we seek the individual flavors of favored Chateaus, the hand picked beans of particular farms, so why not in chocolate too? It was a revelation to me, these individual chocolates. The variety and distinct tastes! It's another culinary world to explore. If only these would become available again, or another similar package."
1,Breakfast Blend is my favorite coffee ever.  I'm so glad it is on Amazon now.  It makes it easy to send to my family and friends before I come visit them.  That way I can get the best cup of coffee any where I go.
0,"The package was wrapped properly. The cookies were not fresh. They were broken into small pieces. Considering shipping charge, overall the price wasn't worth for these cookies. I wish I had purchased more at the Disneyland."
1,These cookies are awesome! Its a slightly salty cracker with tons of chocolate inside. If you heat them up for a few seconds its a flavor explosion!!!! I love Pucca fishies.
1,I received a package from a friend that lives in Japan and some of these were in the box. They are so good I couldn't stop eating them. I looked them up on the net and found them here. I was so excited when I found out I could order them and have them on hand all the time. Don't hesitate to buy them because you'll love them! I also like the ones that have banana flavor in them.
1,"I developed a Pucca addiction during my year in Japan.  They became quite a comfort food to help with the homesickness.  Though I have been able to find other Meiji treats here in the States, all have been quite inferior to the one and only Pucca. Puccas have proved to be quite elusive here.  Thank you Amazon!"
1,Purchased as a gift. The recipient had never tried them but loves them both at room temp and warmed up for a few seconds. I'm curious if they would taste good chilled too.
1,I brought back some from Japan.  Even better when you pack some for a hike on a hot summer day.  They are delicious when warm!
0,"The product that is pictured and described is exactly what I wanted:  milk chocolate/raspberry sticks.  So why did they send me chocolate from the Dark Side?  I could have gotten dark chocolate/raspberry sticks almost anywhere locally; but I wanted milk chocolate, which is why I ordered this product from Penguin through Amazon."
0,"If I had known this is tea with flavoring, then I wouldn't have ordered it. I get sick from green tea and black tea. That's why I gave it one star. I thought it was elderberry tea, which it isn't."
1,"Lower calories and carbs are main plus. Also, cook and serve tastes better than instant."
1,"This is the best product. I use it in a sugarfree lemon pie, which comes out delicious. It is almost impossible to find this product in the grocery store. Thank you Amazon for carrying it. I've even bought it for friends who have to watch their sugar intake."
1,Purchased from amazon because we couldn't find in local stores.It tastes the same as store bought and we know we have it when we want to make a pudding pie.
1,"This product has been difficult for me to find on my grocery store shelves, so I turned to Amazon.com for my satisfaction.  I love a creamy sweet snack in the evening, however I don't want to go over my usual 120 pound weight,  so this is a natural. I make it in my microwave and it takes less than seven minutes total time. AND, I get my requisite calcium from the milk. I use non-fat."
1,The product was not available on supermarket shelves no matter where we looked. Since I need sugar-free food it was great to find this on line. We use it for one particular recipe.
1,"I love this product and add canned pumpkin to it.  It has not been available in Tacoma, WA, for the last few years, and I am so glad to be able to order it via Amazon."
1,For more than a year this product has been no longer available in the stores where we shopped for groceries. I was delighted to find it on Amazon.com and at a lower price than the still available chocolate version is in the stores.
1,"great, I love this product very much and will order it again sometime in the futurn.  Next time i will get the choc pudding the cook kind.  thank you, Rita"
1,"It had become a quest for me to find Jell-o VANILLA Cook & Serve Pudding in the sugar-free, fat-free recipe, and NOT the Instant type.  I could find chocolate occasionally, but NEVER vanilla.  I like to use it not only for a lower calorie pudding dessert, but it makes delicious pies.  Use a little less fat-free milk, add a little cocoa powder, and it makes a yummy chocolate pie; or add some sliced bananas and a graham cracker crust, and you have a dessert you can serve to guests.  Or, what is really delicious is to add the cocoa powder AND the sliced bananas for a chocolate/banana cream pie.  Top it with some low calorie whipped topping and some chocolate shavings, and it looks like it came from your favorite bakery.  It's wonderful, quick and easy to prepare, and tastes great.  I had literally looked in every grocery store where I live and could NEVER find it, so I did an on-line search and there it was at Amazon!  And the price is very reasonable.  Thank you again, Amazon!!  In fact, the guests we had at dinner last night also thank you!"
1,I ordered 48 as I can no longer find it in my local stores.  It's great as is or<br />even better when you add sliced bananas or shredded coconut after cooking.  I call<br />this the diabetic's or dieter's answer to babana cream or coconut cream pie!
1,"I was so happy to find the Sugar-Free Jell-O cook & serve vanilla pudding here at Amazon.  My local grocery stores no longer carry it.  Being diabetic, it really comes in handy for a lot of my sugar free recipes.  I don't know what I'd do without it."
1,"Creamy, delicious while still hot.  Low on calories.  I prefer a little nutmeg sprinkled on hot vanilla.  Add fresh strawberries for a treat.  Beats the heck out of cold pudding.  Instant is a joke."
1,"What is there to say it is pudding!!! It is great I like it, that is why I bought it."
1,I like that this juice has vegetables and that I don't have to add water to it. My only comment would be that I wish it came in a bigger size. I always have to give him 2.
1,"Moderate size packaging, and not too sweet like other small juice packets. I feel good giving this to my kids."
1,"This cookie is fabulous!  Its crunchy, its lightly lemony, and low in calories!  What more can you ask for.  Little one love them too!"
1,We used to be able to buy these cookies locally but haven't found them in a long while.  Finally saw they were available through Amazon and bought a whole case of them.  We like to have two cookies with coffee each morning to get the day off to a good start.  Will order again and again.
1,"These light and airy cookies are fantastic. The anise flavor is just right, not overbearing. You will be very satisfied with this product without a doubt.Give them a try & you'll have a new favorite cookie like me. Amazon was fantastic with my order. They were fast and I had no problems with the order. I will use amazon again for my online purchases."
1,"As an Italian woman who couldn't find the time to make these ""cookies"" for Christmas, I ordered a case and gave them to colleagues. They were better than any I've ever made and equally as good as the ones my mother made with me for years. I am getting married in April and plan on ordering more for that event as well.  They are fabulous."
1,"Really enjoy these cookies, Light Low  Cal and great with a  Cup of Coffee, for breakfast..."
1,I have tried all 3 flavors of the pizzelles and the anise is my favorite.  A great treat for anyone especially those who are trying to watch their weight.
1,"Don't know if they are fattening or not, but they are so yummy.  Even though they have reduced the size of their package for the same amount of money (the old one less olive), they are still worth every dime."
1,"Only one problem, they arrived, packaging wasn't the best, and they were stale. Still love them, but wish I could get a reliable souce of this product on a regular basis and have them fresh."
0,"Upon recieving order, Boston Baked Beans were immediately thrown in the trash. It may be a personal preferrence but, they were hard as a rock and not soft at all where the coating is concerned.They were removed from my list. I ordered a good supply but, was really disapointed. Not so much in the seller but, in the product."
1,"Bcz everything is premeasured this is a product my kindergartener can understand and prepare.  If possible, I'd put this on repeated shipping basis."
1,"This chili is hot, spicy, and savory. This is big boy and girl stuff all the way,folks!  Not for the faint of heart or those with a mild palate:)<br /><br />Hormel, please keep this one coming! It has good fiber and protein content. Delicious. Add a salad or a veggie on the side and dinner is on and poppin!<br /><br />Now to HORMEL, PACKERS, DISTRIBUTORS, and SHIPPERS:<br /><br />PLEASE MAKE CERTAIN YOU PACKAGE GOOD, UNDENTED CANS WHEN YOU SHIP OUT CUSTOMER ORDERS. And make certain transit couriers are informed to do their part in the delivery process also. If you save me $0.50 on a can because I bought it from Amazon, how nice of you.  But if you send me a contorted can that neither I nor you would use yourself, then I haven't realized any savings, and neither have you. So lets all do our part to make happy seller-consumer relationships .<br /><br />And thank you Amazon for offering new cans or a refund for products received that were not in good shape. Yours is a very tough task yet your customer relations is second to none. Thank you, again and again."
1,"Hickory smoked crunchy almonds are served in KLM's economy class, but I couldn't find the same almonds so far although I checked all hickory smoked almonds by famous brands. Now I finally found. This is the taste I was looking for more than 2 years. The best Hickory smoked almonds I ever tried."
1,"These are absolutly delicious. I've ordered these several times and they are always fresh and tasty. I freeze mine cuz I like the crunchyness. Is that a word. LOL. These nuts drive me nuts to eat more. And, they are a great snack because they are healthy for you. So eat up!!!!"
0,"Batter does not get mixed thoroughly in the package no matter how much shaking and tapping you do.  Alot of the batter was left in the container handle.  Produced very thin, tasteless brownies."
1,"While I always liked peanuts, it wasn't until I chose them as a low carb, low sugar snack that I discovered that no other brand compared to the taste of Planter's.  Then they started to get scarce - everyone was discontinuing them, or charging exorbitant prices.  I bought them at WalMart until they discontinued them, and then special ordered from my local market until they couldn't get them for me.  Then I discovered them at Amazon -- and at a good price, delivered.  I am a happy customer!!"
1,"I was really excited when I received this in the mail. Naturally, I had to check that everything was in there, and everything really was there. As I wrapped my dad's present, I smiled, thinking he's just going to love this, and this will make him really happy. Planters Redskin Spanish peanuts are his favorite type of peanuts, but they are really hard to find. It's been many long years since I could find them in the grocery stores. So just like I found my favorite candy on amazon, I found my dad's favorite peanuts. When it came time to opening his present, he just couldn't believe what I had gotten for him! His whole face lit up, and he immediately opened one and started snacking. While continuously waiting for his approval, he said he's finally gotten that good old taste back into his mouth again! Christmas for us was perfect!"
1,"It is impossible to find Spanish Peanuts in the stores. This was the best gift I could give my father!! Will last a year, and stay fresh!!"
1,"Nope, let's not talk about honey roasted peanuts.  Or cocktail peanuts.  Or cashews. . .pistachios. . .or even mixed nuts (unless we're talking about my family reunion).  When I crave a high protein snack, I reach for the Redskins--PLANTERS SPANISH PEANUTS (REDSKIN).<br /><br />These little red goobers are delicious; and even better, I can scarf down a few handfuls of them and not have my waistline explode.  The Redskins are a perfect addition to parties and get-togethers, and what better way to watch a sporting event than to munch on the Spanish.  And with the name Planters, you know you're going to be getting quality and freshness.  So if you're hunkering for a wholesome, salty snack, look for the peanut sporting a tophat, monocle, and cane--PLANTERS SPANISH PEANUTS (REDSKIN).  You'll go nutty.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq."

1,"These are very, very hard to find here in Kentucky.  By far the best Spanish nuts (or Redskin nuts) on the market.  I love them and they are a great Value!!"
0,The last order for Planters Redskin Spanish Peanuts that you sent us was the ones with sea salts.  I order<br />these Redskins for my wife.  She says they are not as good.  I will not order any more peanuts if the sea salts<br />are all that you carry now.  The only reason we order from you folks is because the old redskins are hard<br />to find in our local stores.  The ones I ordered had the red label. The ones with sea salt have a brown label.
1,"The grocery stores do not carry these anymore Amazon is the only place that you can buy them these are a great little nut. good snack, thanks Amazon."
1,Really enjoy those Redskins. Realy disappointment that Planters discontinued those big cans. Now I have to buy small ones frequently. Let's get them back.
1,"Could not find them at Sam's at Christmas time to make my peanut clusters, so was very happy to be able to get them off of Amazon!  Thanks!"
0,"I was not sent the correct product as advertised.  Therefore, I am not pleased with it.  However, I was reimbursed for my purchase, so I am not out any money.  As a matter of fact, the picture and description that accompanies this survey request is still incorrect.<br /><br />That said, all-in-all, I am very pleased with the most of my experiences with Amazon.com.<br /><br />Thanks for asking."
1,"My wife and I discovered Planters Spanish Redskin Peanuts a number of years ago and since that time there was always a place on our kitchen counter where everyone could share this wonderful treat.<br /><br />Recently the 56-Oz can we purchased contained only very light colored peanuts. These were not as well cooked,  appeared to have less oil used in the roasting process and therefore the salt normally found evenly distributed mostly migrated to the bottom of the can.  Worse, a few peanuts were so brittle I first thought they were foreign objects.<br /><br />In an effort to find the good formula we purchased three of the 12.5-Ounce size and two of the 56-Ounce size.  Unfortunately all were the disappointing new version that we dislike.<br /><br />I just concluded a phone call with Kraft foods (10-8-12), the parent company of Planters.  While they did not admit to the product being changed I was told Spanish Redskin Peanuts were discontinued and would soon be out of stock everywhere.<br /><br />Kraft offered coupons as a good will gesture for all the Planters Spanish Peanuts we're throwing away, but since the old perfect treat is no more, it's a disappointing resolution.<br /><br />Seldom does a commercially manufactured product like this win over both my wife and I.  I must say I'm really sad to see it go, especially since the newest, poorly roasted version is not worth stocking up on."
1,"Saw a bad review on these; can't imagine why someone would rate these things bad? Hey there ain't nothing like Spanish peanuts, they're much better than Virginia peanuts (sorry Virginia that's the way I feel)and from what I have tried, these Planters are the best especially for the price. They're fresh and good flavored. Peanuts are good food as are most other natural foods like eggs beef vegetables etc. Unlike what the food freaks we have today want you to believe. I know they will say peanuts are bad full of fat salt etc but it's not true! That kind of thing does not hurt you if you don't sit and eat two cans or something! Eat good food take supplements and stay away from fast food and prepared junk you may live! Drink whole milk (fresh raw milk may be even better but they will surely deny that)plenty of clean NON Fluoride water and make your own drinks like tea. Fix your own food so you know what's in it! Stay off of the soft drinks fluoride water and prepared food to keep your health. DO NOT listen to what big brother says is good for you, they want you in the hospital!! Vote Them Out!! Though many now disagree it's not a crime to want to control your own diet and health."
1,These nuts are so good and delicious and fresh that I buy them on a subscribe<br />and save basis.  I'm on about my fifth case.  I save about 30% off the individual<br />grocery store can price.  Highly reccomended!
1,"I rarely review products after purchasing things online - I guess I'm not a great contributor to the online community except in the case of being extremely impressed or extremely upset.  I was having dinner with my folks recently, and my dad was complaining that he could never find Spanish Peanuts at the local grocery store anymore.  He said he would find them at Wal-Mart on occasion (about one out of three times he went) - he also tried out a local supplier but was unhappy with the inconsistency of the quality of the nuts.  While he was explaining all this to me, I jumped on Amazon on my iPhone and searched for Spanish Peanuts, found a pack of 12 cans and bought them.  A few days later they showed up at our office and he was blown away!  He couldn't believe something that had been frustrating him for so long could be made so easy by the power of the internet (since then, I've got him connected on an iPad and am hoping I can get him to start surfing Amazon and other online retailers on his own!).  He was so grateful that he gave me two of the cans and I promptly went home and opened one up, made a bowl of vanilla ice cream with hot fudge and spanish peanuts on top - talk about a trip down memory lane!  Reminded me of having dinner over at my grandmother's house when I was a kid and both my father and I have been smiling about this purchase ever since it was made.  Thanks Amazon!!"
1,I have not been able to find these peanuts in stores for about 2 years.I finally Googled them and Amazon came thru! I love these nuts!
1,"Spanish peanuts were my Father's favorite; therefore they became mine. I was able to get them in my old age for awhile, but they disappeared from the shelves of Northern Virginia groceries. I went with the flow for awhile, but eventually got smart and looked to Amazon.com. I was rewarded for my intelligence for I now have my Spanish Peanuts whenever I desire. I am also super happy that Planters uses Sea Salt. Thank you, Suzi"
1,"My wife and I eat these things like peanuts! You can't eat just one, you know! Planters is the best and buying them from Amazon makes it simple. They're cheaper and delivered to my door on a specified schedule. We never run out like we used to and finding these in the stores is not always as easy as one would think! Yeah - GREAT!"
1,Very delicious and lightly salted. Packaged well for shipping and arrived in good shape. My shipment has a freshness date of about 20 months or more on the bottom of the container. Fresh.. delicious.. Very happy with this product.
1,"Spanish peanuts are caviar to peanut lovers. They are a little smaller than other peanut types and have a richer flavor due to a higher oil content. That adds a few calories, but to the peanut connoisseur, it's worth it.<br /><br />The red husk or ""skin"" adds additional flavor. If you've ever tried cooking your own, you know how easy it is to burn the skin. Getting them to come out ""just right"" is a real art.<br /><br />Planters has mastered that art. Their Redskin Spanish peanuts are consistently plump, fresh tasting, and perfectly roasted. The sea salt variety is terrific too.<br /><br />Buying in bulk like this seems like overdoing it, but if you have a peanut lover in your family, you may be surprised how quickly they'll disappear.<br /><br />And as other reviewers have pointed out, Spanish peanuts seem to be getting harder to find these days, so grab 'em while you can."
1,"My husband loves Spanish Peanuts more than any other kind, and especially Planters. We always had several cans of Planters on hand but over the past few years all of our local stores stopped carrying them.  I had family and friends on alert to let me know if they found them somewhere.  We had just about given up when I decided to check Planters themselves and sure enough, they were available thru Amazon. I bought a case and we're almost thru the 10th can, must order more after I finish the review. The peanuts were very fresh and just as good as we remembered."
1,The shipping is very fast and the product (Planters Spanish Peanuts) are always very good and this time was no exception. Thank you for the fast service.  Fred Kaiser.
1,WalMart and the local groceries have stopped carrying Spanish Peanuts.... not sure why. Nice to find a source that wasn't much higher in price.
1,This was a gift.  I was told it arrived on time and was a quality product.
1,"I needed pastel chocolate mints to go along with small pastel flowers for bridal shower favors.  I looked everywhere and found these online, and they were perfect!  They went very well with my paper flowers and everyone loved them."
0,"I wanted a sugar splurge but I chose these Shortbreads by mistake... Partially Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Glucono Delta-lactone, Artificial Vanillin and Artificial Butter Flavors... Yuck! If Amazon won't take them back, I'll have to throw them out."
1,"This is easy to grow, it lasts quite a while and my cats love munching on it instead of my house plant.  If you have it on a tile floor, you need to put something under it so it won't slide in the original plastic container that it was purchased in.  These are just insert refills."
1,"I often use Char Crust Sun-Dried Tomato and Garlic on chicken, but have tried it on turkey and beef also. It works well on all. The easy to follow directions are on the package. I have tried a few other Char Crust varieties, but this flavor is my family's favorite. I will buy this product again."
1,"Reminds me of Lucky Charm marshmallows, but much more creamy.  A little pricey, but delicious.  I'm not much for regular ice cream, but I like this."
1,I got this for my kids easter basket just to have something different and they loved it.  It tastes great and even travels well.  This is a great treat to take in the car or stick in a purse for that time when you are craving ice cream but can't have it.
1,"Im not a big fan of extra strong dark chocolate, but the health benefits are many so I figured I would try a few of them out. This is by far the best one. Actually has more of a sweet taste and any bitterness is hard to even notice. Packed with antioxidants. A few squares a day is a great addition to any healthy diet."
1,"This is a very nice chocolate. It has been cured to a nice crisp hardness. The flavor has dimension to it with a sweet overtone and minimal back end bitterness. I've very impressed. This will definitely be on my ""addiction"" list for reordering."
1,"I order a package of 12 Chocolove Premium Chocolate Bars, which by the way is an excellent chocolate, but when it arrived the bars were bent and melting due to he heat of the delivery truck. I contacted the seller and without questions or argument I was sent another order. I received the order well packed and cold in 2 days. Because I was stunned to see such customer service I contacted the seller once again to offer payment for the UPS cost, but the seller refused stating that their goal is total satisfaction and that I should not pay for the shipping. Just amazing service! I will recommend this seller to anyone and ask to support them. If there were more stars to give I would had given them the max.<br />I hope this review helps.<br />DF"
1,"this is my favourite chocolate ever.  creamy melt in your mouth texture..plus the little squares are domed and fit perfectly against the roof of your mouth (each one has a little heart on it too).  nice dark flavour without the bitterness that can happen in the REALLY dark ones.  i like the darker ones too, but this is my favourite percentage.  the flavoured ones are really yummy as well.  my boyfriend is also addicted to this brand.  maybe you don't think you need to buy twelve at a time, but i think it's a great idea!"
1,"I love chocolate.  Good chocolate.  I've tried fancy bars, local bars, hand-poured bars, organic bars, and almost everything else, and THIS is my favorite.  The chocolate is perfectly dark without being bitter, the orange has an incredibly satisfying crunch and a slight (very slight) chewiness that makes the texture of the bar divine, and the flavor of orange and chocolate together are heavenly.<br /><br />If only they sold it in more places!"
1,"I am not usually a lover of dark chocolate, but when a friend gave me this chocolove premium dark (55%) orange peel as a gift, I fell in love with it. So for Valentine's I decided to buy a box and give my special friends a bar for a happy. Now they are all addicted. The orange peel gives it a special little tang and crunch at the end and I would recommend it to any chocolate lover. It was funny that each person said they could not hold out to make it last a whole day like I had challenged them to. It is just too good."
0,"Not only have i had just about everry brand of belgian chocolate this side of the atlantic, i have had this one several times.  But this seller sent bad chocolate. It has a powdery appearance and is very brittle to touch and taste.  Can't eat it at all.  And i guess i can't return it either."
1,"I treat myself to Chocolove at my local health food store once a month.  I am very conservative on how much sugar I have, so I make one bar last me a whole month.  Yes, it has real sugar, but it is so delightful for the amount of sugar that it has.  A taste of heaven.  I buy the 70% cacao and I am hooked! Seductive bliss!  One more thing, if you are in to dark chocolate, the taste is quite smooth, not bitter as some darks go."
1,"This is the best chocolate bar I've ever tried.  The salty taste is in perfect balance with the chocolate.  I'm not the only one that thinks so, since our local grocery store sells out of this particular bar almost as soon as they arrive.  The other Chocolove bars are fine, but this one is tops."
1,My husband and I occasionally enjoy a few pieces of dark chocolate in the evening and this chocolate is a real treat. It is hard to find such good chocolate at less than $3 per bar. We order a couple cases each fall and keep them in the freezer till we need a new bar. This is not bitter chocolate and just 1/6 (3 small squares) of a bar is only 80 calories and satisfies our desires for dark chocolate.
1,"I first tried this at a small coffee shop and the memory of the taste haunted me until I found it on Amazon.  It is a wonderfully decadent treat in which to indulge, whether to forget your bad day or to reward yourself for a job well done. You can taste the real orange peel shavings in this chocolate and it is that perfect blend of dark chocolate and orange, which is the most divine combination."
1,"So, I do A/B tests.  You know, like buy bar A and then bar B and then eat 'em both.<br /><br />YEARS of doing this shamelessly has led me to become a regular purchaser of Chocolove's Pure Dark.  The 55% one.<br /><br />I don't care much for their other bars -- they're just so-so -- but DANG! the Pure Dark is crazy-good.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor.  Don't just buy this bar.  Buy this bar and then buy ten other chocolate bars.  It's in the name of science, it's okay.  Take all your bars, break them up, then try them all.<br /><br />Yeah, that chocolate that keeps evolving and coating your mouth with subtlety and wizardry?  That's this one."
1,Bought some of these in New Mexico at a co-op store and couldn't find them locally in Florida. Bought on line thru Amazon at a lower price and free shipping. The candy is wonderful and it's truly a sweet deal.
1,"I am a fanatic about fabulous chocolate and even more so when it's combined with orange. AND, boy oh boy, Chocolove has hit the nail on the head with this delicious chocolate bar! Well worth  the price. I would definitely recommend this chocolate...so fantastic!"
1,"My husband a self-proclaimed chocoholic says this is the best chocolate he's ever eaten.  And because it's so high in cocoa content, it's good for him too!  That's all he needed - another reason to eat chocolate ha! ha!  We bought it in 12-bar packs and gave it out over xmas and everyone agreed...great chocolate!"
1,"Someone gave me a bar as a gift.  I had no idea it would be this good.  Better than other orange/choc combos, it has a nice crunch to the peel bits. Yum."
1,Bought one of these at Whole Foods about a month ago.<br /><br />The secret: they freeze-dry the orange peel and this leads<br />to a really strong orange taste with each bite. You get a little<br />bit of peel this way.<br /><br />I've loved orange chocolate since i was a kid and my Dad<br />brought some home from trips. This is an excellent<br />version.
1,"I absolutely love dark chocolate (77% seems to be the magic number) and have tried many different varieties.  This is one of my favorites due to the complex flavor and great dense and smooth texture. Also, this pack of 12 is a economical way to purchase."
1,"Chocolove's Orange Peel in Dark Chocolate is one of the best dark chocolates I've ever eaten. If you're a dark chocolate fan, you owe it to yourself to try this. The orange flavor really shines through and the wrapping is colorful and stylish. The price was amazing too, much less than I pay at other stores."
1,"Best candybars. I was skeptical buying food online, but I can't get these anywhere near me except the Chocolate Show once a year in NYC. They're great - no worries!"
1,"this chocolate is a true treat to eat, perfect texture, almond toffee mix goes together perfectly. the packaging is really cute too. very highly recommended!"
1,I am a dark chocolate person and I love this bar.  It is low in sugar and high in cocoa flavor.
1,"I have tried several and this one has just the right amount of sea salt added to not distract from the chocolate, but adds to the flavor.  It is my favorite.  I have many strong favorites for dark chocolate bars, but this one seems to be the only one to get this combination right."
0,I was disappointed with the quality of the cakes.  They were stale and had an odd underlying taste.  They all had a strange fruit flavor which was gross.
1,"My nephew's little girls loved these pretty cakes. They arrived just after Christmas, which was an extra treat for the family."
1,It's so dank. It's made from the Neem pollen which is also pretty dank. This shit is straight outta India so you know it's dank. I love it cause of its dankness.
1,I can just look at a carb and I gain weight.  This product allows me to eat pasta and not get all the high impact carbs on my blood sugar.  18 grams of fiber is outstanding! Unlike the other reviewer I think it tastes really good.  The texture is a little more chewy and thick but again this is something I like.  I dont miss white pasta at all when I eat this.
1,My husband and I share 5 wonderful elderly aunts and one uncle. This was our choice of a Christmas present. We had them shipped direct and they all could not get over them. The only complaint I had was 2 did not have cards but since all the rest did and the 2 aunts that could not find one are in their late 80's they might have just missed them.  All 5 said they were absolutely beautiful.
1,I bought this basket for my mom as a birthday and christmas present. She loved it! Naturally because its alot of chocolate.
1,"These Puffs are really yummy and gluten free! The Sweet Potato gives them a nice sweet flavor. We munch on these often. We are not gluten free in our house, but it doesn't mater! These also are low in sugar and I like that it is a vegetable flavoring. My 5 year old likes this flavor just as much as the other Puffs flavors."
1,"I was recently shopping for my favorite orange marmalade <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00061KXV4"">Dundee Orange Marmalade 16 oz - 2 Jars</a> and my local supermarket was out of it. I noticed this Robertsons brand on the shelf and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />The Robertsons was a couple of dollars less than the Dundee brand, but it was only 12 oz as opposed to 16 oz for Dundee.<br /><br /> I found it to be an excellent bitter sweet marmalade, although slightly sweeter than I prefer. A more bitter than sweet flavor would be more to my liking, but that's a matter of personal preference. I like rind in my marmalade and it had a decent amount of rind in it but it seemed less than the Dundee brand.<br /><br />Scotland is the home of bitter sweet marmalade, this is where Dundee was made for many years until they shifted there plant to England recently. All of the rest of Europe and the U.S. produce a sweeter version of orange marmalade.<br /><br />I would defiantly buy this brand again, that is of course if I could not find the Dundee brand.<br /><br />NOTE;; I am assuming the SCOTCH on the label refers to Scotland, there is unfortunately no Scotch whisky in this marmalade."
1,This often ridiculed product is actually a cheap source of protein with a nice spiced flavor. It makes a great sandwich spread!
1,"I find this an excellent product to use as a seasoning in soups, beans, or scrambled eggs. It also makes a good spread on unsalted crackers. I find it too salty to use as a spread on things already salted, but subject to that caveat I find it a tasty and nutritious source of protein."
1,"I like this product very much. It is a healthy alternative to greasy pork sausages and bacon in the morning, especially good with grits and eggs, with a bit of butter and a drop of hot sauce. Try it, I believe you will like it."
1,"I ordered the complete set of Totonac sugar free syrups and tested them out with my morning Kellogg's Eggo waffles.<br /><br />Some of the syrups are pretty good; others are really not my thing and I threw them out. My verdict/opinion is: Almond, Maple Syrup and Vanilla are pretty good; the Raspberry is okay (if you crave some fruit taste); but I couldn't handle the taste of the Blueberry, Butter Pecan, Caramel, Hazelnut and Vanilla Cinnamon.<br /><br />The syrup is not thick like most syrups on the market; it's more runny and I find myself pouring some syrup out on to a plate and then dipping pieces of torn waffles."
1,"Compared to local stores where only 2-4 oz packaging is sold, this is a great bargain.  It's an advantage to have a large amount available--this inspires experimental use that livens up meals and contributes to good health. (Cayenne has significant, clinically proven health/medical benefits.)"
1,"1ST THE SLICED VARIETY. SHE LOVES IT. THEN THE GRILLED SEAFOOD VARIETY. KITTY BLISS. NOW HER 1ST DELIGHTS FLAVOR, TURKEY + CHEESE. LICKED THE PLATE CLEAN AS WITH THE OTHERS. MY BABY CANT GET ENOUGH OF THIS FANCY FEAST SO I'M OFF 2 CHOOSE ANOTHER FLAVOR 4 HER. I AM HER MORE THAN WILLING SLAVE 4 LIFE AFTERALL. 4 PAWS UP! ..P.S. ORDERED THESE WEDNESDAY NIGHT, RECEIVED FRIDAY MORNING. FASTEST DELIVERY TO BE HAD!"
1,"The wife and I like Mustard as opposed to ketchup. We experiment with many brands of mustard. We do like this among others we have selected at Amazon. Buying from Amazon is simply easier and generally ships free... I am so happy with the Amazon selections. Bottom-line, if you want something different buy this. Hope this helps."
1,"This is an awesome, convenient product.  My kids actually like this better than ""real"" (i.e. meat) taco filling.  It's much quicker to make than hamburger, lower fat, and obviously stores for much longer.  We aren't vegetarian but I try to limit our meat intake so I always use this in our tacos.  I'm glad Amazon carries this because it's not available at our local grocery stores.  Yummy!"
1,"Excellent product, very tasty. Highly recommended by people who are<br />on the Nutrisystem program.  Makes up very fast and you can freeze<br />servings for future use.  Five star rating. M"
1,This is a great product if you don't eat meat.It is easily made with water and tastes great ! The taco flavoring is yummy.
1,"I am always willing to try New Products; however, I didn't want to buy Twelve Boxes from Amazon, What if we didn't like it? So I got one Box of FANTASTIC Taco Filling from somewhere else, and decided to give it a try, Followed the Cooking Directions and made the Entire Package in a Sauce Pan with 1 3/4 cup of boiling water and two teaspoons of oil<br /><br />Since I found the Sodium a little high for our taste 520 MG, 22% (we don't use a lot of salt) I decided to compensate all that salt by adding about one Tablespoon of Onions and another of Green Bell Peppers to the mix, very finely chopped that I had sauteed in a non-stick skillet with two drops of oil (no salt) even though in the List of Ingredients there is Dehydrated Onions and Onion Powder but I also wanted something fresh, so I mix it all up reduce heat and simmer 5-6 minutes or until liquid is absorbed, stirred every now and then...and like Magic it turned into what it looked like Ground Beef,...Wow, Wee! It was Good, we were very Surprised<br /><br />I make my own Taco Shells, I like the White Corn Tortillas, Crispier, fry them in vegetable oil folded into a taco shape, I use tongs and a spoon for help, drained on paper towels, filled them with about two or three Tablespoons of the Fantastic Taco Filling, add Salsa, Chopped Romaine Lettuce and top them with Shredded Cheddar Cheese,...So Good, The Best Tacos We Had in a Long Time<br /><br />You can get about 10 Tacos out of one Box and Yes, we liked it Better than Meat, and we felt good knowing we were NOT Eating a Cow-Steer, Now we are ready to order the Twelve Boxes from Amazon.com,... in fact we just Did! ... Check Pictures Posted Step by Step of Making Tacos, located under the Item's Image, Thank You"
1,"I've been a fan of this product for about 12 years now.....it is easy, fast, healthy and delicious....but I have to gripe about the price.....less than ten years ago it was about $23 a case (shipped) now it's over $33<br /><br />Soon I'm going to stop buying it (like I have with so many other products) because they are (unjustifiably) raising the prices exponentially on a simple dried soy protein product. Realistically, it should be about $1 per box.<br /><br />America will pull out of this recession when we finally figure out that sticking it to ANOTHER American is not going to help pull us out of your financial problems, and when we decide NOT to stick it to the next guy to recover our losses<br /><br />Having said that, I still eat this product, but the price hike turned me off bigtime<br />If I see it go up one more time, I will add it to my list of gouger companies, and never buy it again.<br />At that point it will be cheaper to make my own."
1,"I usually add half a pack of taco seasoning for more flavor. It makes great chili too (that I also have used for enchiladas). Tastes awesome in an omelet and great on nachos.<br /><br />I have had many countless people try it and no one could tell it was meatless (and I'm from Texas). It's the best tasting meatless tacos I found yet, and each box is equivalent to a pound of ground beef and barely over $2."
1,"My wife and I recently became vegetarians, some days its a little harried to get home, kick off your shoes relax a minute before you start dinner..FANTASTIC FOODS to the rescue...some days when you need help to get a meal out in a few minutes..FF does the job well..we have tried several different flavors like the Taco filling, Tofu Scramble, Hummus, Sloopy Joe's, Vegetarian Chili, Falafel...none of which have dissapointed us and as you can see I am semi-retired chef. The best part is the  ease of preparation...amazing flavors with no meat!! and nothing really strange in the ingredients label. We have learned to buy it by the case as it can be somewhat expensive at most grocery stores as they price it like a specialty product...I'll put it to you this way..it taste go enough to fool most meat eating palates and if you want to turn the kids over quick..use the Sloppy Joe's as much as the Taco Filling.  The taste is a winner!! Bon Apettit!"
1,"I have been buying this for years. We are a vegetarian family. I have tried many taco products, but this is by far the best! It is shelf stable, so no refrigeration is needed. You can stock up on a whole case, however we love it so much that it doesn't last long. I use it in many recipes such as Taco soup, Taco casserole, nachos, taco salad and of course, tacos! This is quick to prepare and popular...even with meat-eaters!"
1,"Fantastic World Foods mixes are terrific! We're new to vegetarian eating and experimenting with the many products available now.  We've tried the falafel, chicken patty, hamburger, hummus, sloppy joe, and taco filling mixes.  Every one of them is delicious.  For me, it's about the texture and flavor.  This taco filling nails it - you will not be able to tell the difference between this vegetarian mix and hamburger.  As a matter of fact, I like the taste better than ground beef. Amazon makes it easy and inexpensive to stock up with the 12-box packs. You can also find Fantastic Foods brands at most whole/health food stores. I like to add diced onions to the mix. Toss in some jalapenos for a little kick. Yummy!"
1,I was skeptical at first because it didn't look like it would make very much. But it makes PLENTY! We had a lot of leftovers and we invited people over to have it. It tastes really good and has the perfect texture. It is easy and fast to make. Even the omnivores couldn't get enough of it.
1,tried this for the first time today it was so good. kids loved it .the texture is just like taco filling and no grease. and one box make a lot of filling<br />http://www.amazon.com/Fantastic-Foods-Filling-4-4-Ounce-Boxes/dp/B000GZY9HY/ref=sr_1_1?s=grocery&ie=UTF8&qid=1302206977&sr=1-1
1,"I love making my own mock taco bell tacos, ever since I swore off that place. This 'meat', even my die hard meat eating family members like it. Yummay."
1,"I decided to try this based on the review here. It's absolutely wonderful! So quick to make and YUMMY. No icky grease to deal with like hamburger meat, too. My 16 month old granddaughter loved it. I didn't add any spices to it at all, and it was great just like that. All you have to do is boil some water and let it simmer for about 5 minutes. Easy!"
1,"Great vegan tacos in a few minutes. Add water and a little olive or any oil. Heat quickly to eat over greens  for a high protein, low calorie, fast lunch, or add extra onions while sauteing and build tacos with all the fixings.  Very tasty, made right here in Petaluma,Ca, with high quality ingredients.  Healthy for kids!"
1,"This product is great.  It cooks up in minutes and tastes just like seasoned beef.  We use it for not only tacos, but casseroles, mexican lasagna, etc.  I'm sure we'll be buying another case shortly, even though there are only two in our household.  Thanks Fantastic Foods!"
1,"I love this stuff because it tastes great, does not require refridgeration and takes only minutes to make."
1,"This stuff is great -- tastes kind of like taco bell meat. Seriously!<br />Good for vegetarians, and the just plain lazy. =)"
1,"The product is great and a healthier alternative to ground beef, inexpensive, easy to prepare in tacos, taco salad, burritos, and nachos, easy to store for long periods and a crowd pleaser.  No worry about cholesterol or BSE either.<br /><br />My only problem was with the distribution center that has on four occasions sent only one box instead of the 12 boxes (case lot) that I ordered."
1,"I originally found this taco filling at the local health food store.  They no longer sell it, and I was estatic on finding it on Amazon!  I absolutely love it!  It tastes great!  I even have made it for my meat eating family, and they all liked it!!  The expiration dates on the boxes are early summer of next year, so I will have plenty of time to eat them before they expire!  Looks like I will be having tacos tonight!  YUM!!"
1,"Anyone who has gone vegan or vegetarian knows how much you miss tacos. I tried this and I just can't believe how good it is! I made hard shell tacos with this today and soy cheese and I just can't believe how fabulous it tastes. The falafel this company makes is pretty good too!<br /><br />Please don't ever stop making this stuff! None of my carnivore family can even tell this is soy....If you are on the fence about this, don't hesitate-try it! The people who are saying it's too salty are entitled to their opinion, but this has no more salt in it than any other taco I've had in my life."
1,"As I was cooking this for the first time, I took a taste to check for seasoning and thought it was a little on the salty side.  Once I added the usual toppings to my taco it was excellent.  Very close to ground beef tacos in taste and texture."
1,"I find it kind of funny how some people found this too salty.  I had to add more salt because to be it wasn't salty enough!  I made some nachos with this and they turned out great.  Most likely someone who didn't know this wasn't real meat wouldn't be able to tell the difference.  I made some enhancements for my tastes, by adding some extra salt, garlic powder, onion bits, and substituting some of the oil it calls for with sharp cheddar, which melts right into at and gives it a little tang and richness.  I bought 3 of these on special at the local grocery store, hoping I wasn't making a mistake, and I'm happy I made the purchase."
1,These are easy to make and are always in rotation in my pantry.<br />They taste better than real meat with that taco flavoring added.<br />Unfortunately they seem to be getting harder to get at my local store.<br />I would also highly recommend the sloppy joe mix from them too.<br /><br />Jaime Pico
1,These tacos are great. Highly recommend for all vegetarians. Better tnan the meat tacos you make or get out.
1,"I've been a vegetarian for almost 15 years, and I LOVE this taco filling. I've used it to make straight up traditional tacos, enchiladas as well as ""taco pie. I love that the texture somewhat resembles meat, so you can easily substitute it in recipes that call for ground beef.  However, my omnivorous family members are quite skeptical about this product and prefer that I leave it out of dishes. Ultimately, I look at this as a vegetarian's meat substitute, and not a universal meal substitute."
0,I received a case of this hoping to add it to our vegan menu. Made the first batch and could not eat it is was so salty. Gave the other 11 boxes to the owner of our local organic market.
1,To everyone crying about the salt content:<br /><br />If you look at the nutrition facts and do the math you'll find the salt content of pappy's seasoning is only about 24% (290 mg of salt per 1.2 g serving size). one of the most common dry rub methods called the 8-3-1-1 formula uses 3 parts salt. that is equivalent to about 23% salt in the rub mix. Based on those numbers it is apparent that pappy's is right in line with traditional dry seasoning recipes.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite seasonings for chicken and beef and I suggest that the lower scoring reviews be disregarded when considering purchasing this product.
1,This rub is not only my secret seasoning on my bbq in my wood burning pit but is awesome on rottissiere<br />(sp?) chicken. I give it out to my friends w/o the lable on it to keep the secret in TN. SHHH! Pass it on.<br />M
1,"A friend from California introduced us to this seasoning and since then, it is a must have for my kitchen.  It adds a nice zing to a variety of dishes; to season steak & B-que, in spagetti sauce, chili, etc.  Pretty much anything I cook that is beef or pork has some Pappy's seasoning in the dish. You won't be disappointed."
1,"I bought this rub on a whim, which is unusual for me. I'm glad that I did. It's an exceptionally good, well balanced  and versitile dry seasoning mix. I have used it on beef, chicken, salad and soup and it worked on all. Last night, the SO wanted a rub for some shrimp dish and I let her pick from several, all but one of which were my own formulas. She was delighted with the Pappy's Choice. I suspect that I'll be glad to have the full two pounds because it's going to get a lot of use. About the only thing that I cannot see using it for is on desserts."
1,Rub or seasoning for meat or fish. If you like to grill you should have this seasoning.
1,I love this stuff! It is an easy seasoning to use and makes meat delicious.
1,"Great rub, great service, arrived in record time. Have ordered this several times it is a favorite of ours!"
1,"This used to be sold at Costco and was discontinued for some reason, so we searched high and low and finally found it on amazon.  We LOVE this seasoning - it's an all-in-one bottle of delicious.  It makes the flavor pop from shrimp to rib-eye.  You just have to try it, but if you need a recommendation... I give it a thumbs up!"
1,I was introduced to this product by a butcher shop in California. THey would perferate a steak and then place some Pappys on it and put it in a ziplock bag to marinate. It really brings out a good flavor when BBQ'ing the meat after it has soaked up the spices. The part I really like is that it does not contain MSG!
1,"Pappy's is a perfect addition to anything. Especially any meat cooked on the grille. Just enough pop to spice things up, but not too hot or spicy. We shake it on meat before we grill like a light meat rub. Pappy's stays on the meat and gives it a nice flavor."
1,By far the best seasoning for steak or pork. Ordered extras for family members because they always ask what I used on the steaks. No need for steak sauce with this seasoning.
1,Love this stuff for steaks and even fish on the grill.  So nice to see it online.  Thought I was going to have to have brother send me up some from Ca. I'm hooked on this seasoning.
1,"I discovered this at Costco also but am now buying it from Amazon. Got some on the way now.<br /><br />I use this everywhere. Steak, Tri-Tip, Hamburger, Pork Chops, Fish and in Soup's and Stew's. I've overdosed a few times and made things a little too salty. So go easy till you figure out the right amount for your application. But they also make a 50% less salt and a salt free version.<br /><br />Thanks Pappy!"
1,"I just replenished my supply of Pappy's, having used it for years. I discovered it one day at Costco, but since they no longer carry it I'm glad Amazon does. I'm buying some for my son, who's always asking how to prepare different foods.<br /><br />I tell him when you're grilling, start with Pappy's!"
1,Being a fan of Central California Santa Maria style BBQ I can't live without this stuff. It goes on everything. Especially good as a dry rub for Tri Tip
1,"We use Pappy's seasoning on every kind of meat, fish and fowl. It even peps up the taste of grilled  veggies. We've been using it for years and will continue."
1,"I am absolutely in love with Pappy's spice blends!  They are great on a variety of meats and my family gobbles up anything I BBQ with it. You can't go wrong using this product, trust me!<br /><br />Thank you Pappy's for creating the perfect spice blend!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Audra Van Fossen"
1,"My neighbor got us turned on to this. We are using it a lot now. We make soup base out of half chicken broth and half pappy's seasoning, then add chicken or beef and cut veggies.  Everyone raves about it, even neighborhood kids. It's different every time depending on what veggies we use.  Famly size soup can be made from scratch for just a few dollars.  Even kids like it. I also use it to flavor steaks and roasts.  This seasoning is a well kept secret."
1,"My nephew in Fresno CA turned me on to this.  Packed some to take home, used it up and glad I can order on line.  We love this on everything.  Other reviews about salt, they do make a low salt version to try.  Great on burgers, steaks...chicken."
0,Number one on the list is salt<br /><br />Oh Yeah! Lottsa salt. So much so that it overpowers everything else.<br /><br />WAY too much salt. Eating it straight from the shaker comes to mind.<br /><br />I tried to cut it with about two cups of other spices. No dice.<br />Can't kill the salt.<br /><br />Save your money and make your own.
1,"This product becomes available every Easter and I always purchase them for the kids. The description says it all:<br />""solid milk chocolate bunny made with Cadbury dairy milk""<br /><br />The two keys words being 'solid' and 'Cadbury'<br /><br />Cadbury chocolate is amazing, more milky than most other chocolate."
1,"The normal Oregon Chai is good, but if you're more fond of the chai that you get at a certain chain of coffee shops that originate in Seattle, you want this chai.  It has the same tingling, almost burning, sensation that theirs does, and it's much cheaper and more convenient.  Just make sure you pick up a pump as well."
1,"My favorite has been the Tazo Organic, which is a little spicier I believe than the Tazo Original Chai.  My understanding is that Starbuck's uses the Tazo Organic.<br /><br />I tried the Extra Spicy Oregon Chai because the price of Tazo Organic concentrate went very high, from $24 to $40 for a 6 pack, well above retail.  I cannot get it locally.<br /><br />This stuff is super concentrated.  I use 2 ounces to make 14 ounces.  The package recommends 3 ounces for 16, and that is fine, though perhaps a little spicy.  I am pleased that I get a great cup of Chai for a relatively low price.  It is costing $0.76 for the concentrate per cup plus the cost of the milk.  I took the every 6 month automatic shipping option to save 15% ($15).<br /><br />To me, at this concentration, it is very similar to the Tazo Organic Chai.  In fact, I recently had a Starbuck's Chai, and I actually preferred my home made stuff to theirs."
1,"This exact product is used at all of the high end coffee houses around here. The taste is very authentic and filled with flavor. The extra spicy has more of a ginger and cardamon taste than the regular chai in this brand. Personally, I grew up on home brewed chai so, for me, this is as close to that as I have tasted and I have tried all of the concentrates available to the public. A 64 ounce jug of concentrate will make 32, ten ounce chais. Of course you can add more or less concentrate to taste. But the recommended ratio is 5:1. As you can see, you can save lots of $$$$. At the prices that you pay around here for chais, I have paid for the jug after 5 chais!"
0,"When I traveled to Boston late last summer, the ex and I planned to serve margaritas as a prelude to several dinners for family and friends.  We bought the tequila and the triple sec, and I brought along a large bag of coarse sea salt.  For the limes, I suggested that she buy two 16-ounce bottles of Realime, rather than us doing all that washing, cutting, and juicing of dozens of the real things.<br /><br />That was a major mistake.  On the first night, the cocktails were bitter and insipid.  We raced out the next day to buy some real limes for the other dinners.<br /><br />This product is probably fine if a recipe calls for a quarter teaspoon of lime juice, or if you want a splash of lime on your broiled or pan-fried fish.  But don't use it when lime juice is a principal ingredient.  Bite the bullet and juice the real thing."
1,"This seasoning is without a doubt the best I've ever come across - and the most versatile.  It can be used on veges, potatoes, salads, beef, pork, chicken, fish and probably lots of things I've forgotten to mention.  The flavor is robust yet does not overwhelm the food it's used on.  What more can be said?  Love it!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00473XRIS"">Weber Grill Seasoning, Roasted Garlic Herb, 2.75-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>"
1,"This is one of the most delicious fruit strips I've ever had. Fruit strips are one of my favorite healthy sweet-tooth snacks & I buy a variety of brands. These have much more flavor than the Stretch Island, but are incredibly more expensive, so more of a occasional treat. They do also have quite a lot more Vitamin C than the Stretch Island at the same calorie count, so they are more healthy - but there are only ten per box."
1,"If you love this candy, then go ahead and buy this package. If you have no idea what this tastes like, don't bother. I bought a case because the price of the case versus each pack of candy worked out to much less than what I would pay at the store. The product was fresh and tasted even better than the ones that sit in vending machines for weeks.<br /><br />My only complaint/concern is that I ordered for this product in the middle of a heat wave, and consequently the little jelly candies had melted or burst a little in the bag, so they stuck together. Other than that, it just gave me a reason to eat them sooner.<br /><br />This is a good idea to buy if you want some Halloween candy or something to pack with your lunch as a little dessert."
1,"This is a very sweet candy.  It doesn't taste much like Starburst except for the flavor choices, strawberry, cherry, lemon and orange."
0,"I ordered several boxes of Starburst candies from this business because their website site said ""free shipping"" for orders over $80. Soon thereafter, I received an email from them saying my order has been cancelled(no explanation why). I go back to their website afterwards and noticed that the price for these candies had risen by $4 per box. Guess they thought they weren't making enough money off of me. I won't be ordering from them again because I don't trust them. Who knows if you will get your order or not. Sorry fellows, but you won't stay in business doing stuff like this."
1,"Keep up the good work. This is the best pepper sauce ever,not to hot but has a definate kick with great flavor. The best ever. We've used this for years(a gift from a child who traveled). So glad to find a place to purchase it."
1,"I too have been a devoted fan of The Pepper Plant Hot Pepper Sauce for years.  True, it has a spicy hot flavor - but the hotness never overpowers the wonderful flavor this sauce emparts.  Terrifically versatile, I've used it on beef and chicken - even in soups! So if you're looking for a hearty, rich-flavored sauce with a hotness that won't melt your molars, give this one a taste. You won't be sorry.<br /><br />Truly exceptional."
1,"My husband and I love this stuff!  We tried it for the first time about 10 years ago at a small steakhouse in central California.  We have kept it in our fridge ever since.  We used to be able to buy it in the grocery stores in California, but since moving to Arizona we now purchase it online.  We love it with grilled New York steaks."
1,"I first tried this sauce at Nepenthe in Big Sur and absolutely loved it.  I bought a small bottle there, and that was quickly gone once I got home.  I was thrilled to find that I could order it online!  I bought 6 large bottles and went through them in a few months.  Luckily, I was back in CA again a few weeks ago and brought home more large bottles.  But, I know I'll be done with those soon and will order online again!  Also, I'm not the only one that thinks so highly of this sauce.  Everyone that tries it in my house loves it!  Note that I like the other sauces, but don't love them as I do this original one."
1,I have been using this stuff for over 14 years. Yes that's right over 14 years. I try others but nothing and I mean nothing even comes close to Pepper Plant. I moved from Ca to FL and was really bummed when I could not find this here. I had my mom send me 6 bottles every 3 months till I found it online. Now I buy it by the case. It's got some kick but wont burn your tongue out of your head and has tons of taste( will make your tongue lick your lips looking for more). I have yet to find anything that this does not taste good on. If you want a pepper sauce then look at nothing else cause this is what you have been looking for. Every person I have let try this has swapped over and this is the sauce they all use now. I don't even want to think about them ever stopping making this stuff. Life would just not taste the same.
1,"The best hot sauce you will ever find. I live in Ft Worth Texas, and I always have my father ship me this hot sauce whenever I need it(he lives in San Jose) Now that I can buy it online, I never run out!!! Its a bit expensive here on amazon, but if you look around, you can buy it directly from the manufacturer. You will have to buy it by the case though (12- 10oz bottles) but its well worth it if you use it as much as I do."
1,I discovered this hot sauce in a small cafe in Big Sur on my way back from Mendocino on my motorcycle.  I usually use the green Tabasco but gave this a try.  I now use 1 bottle minimum per week.  I love mexican food so it goes great with burritos and such.  I now buy 1 dozen at a time.
1,"You really need to try this Pepper Plant Sauce. You can have it with any type of meat or you can add it to almost anything and mix. I really don't like hash browns but I add a little Peper Plant and I eat then all. It's really great stuff, wish more restaurants would have Papper Plant on hand over any other steak sauce"
1,"I first had this wonderful concoction on a breakfast table in Carmel California.  It is a wonderful addition to any egg dish and particularly on omelete's.  Mildly spicy hot with underlying taste of roasted peppers.  I've been buying it in Gilroy California for years until the store closed. This is the perfect online source, and the price is exactly the same.  You won't be dissapointed.  Their Chipotle is milder but also a beautiful sauce for steaks with a slight garlic flavor along with mild peppers."
1,"There is a reason this pepper sauce has garnered nothing but 5-star ratings. It can't be beat. We first encountered this product at the Wagon Wheel in Carmel Valley. It is terrific on eggs and fried potatoes. Fortunately, they were also selling it, so we purchased a bottle to try at home and we have never stopped buying it.<br /><br />Living in Southern Cal, we have not found a source in this area, but it is plentiful in the Central Coast and Northern Cal areas. We buy it by the case directly from the producer at a great price.<br /><br />We recommend sticking with the Original California Style. Have tried the other variations, but the Original is the best. It has plenty of zip, but does not overwhelm your taste buds with heat. The focus is on flavor."
1,"i first tried this hot sauce at a wonderful restaurant on a trip to San Luis Obispo and was immediately hooked!  I desperately asked the waitress where i can find it, contemplated stealing the bottle but thought better of it, and she told me they sell it at Vons!!!  So i picked up a couple bottles of different flavors, and they were spent in just over a months time!  It has that nice peppery flavor that often gets masked with too much spice, when compared to other hot sauces.  The flavor comes out, not just the heat, making this my favorite hot sauce!!!  I like to have it on hard boiled eggs mixed with mustard, i use with any marinade as well to add some heat."
1,"I love this stuff. I first encountered this sauce at ""The Lucky Cafe"" in Sacramento, CA and couldn't find any where I now live in Oregon. This stuff is available through an amazon affiliate Taylors Market (great people). Go get some and you will swoon."
1,I order this for my husband and he absolutely loves it.  Anyone who eats with us and tries this sauce loves it as well.  I have ordered before from Taylor's Market and will do so again.  They always arrive quickly and the bottles are well packed.
1,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007SN7B4"">The Pepper Plant Original California Style Hot Pepper Sauce</a><br /><br />It's spicy but doesn't burn. My family is hooked, and we put it on everything. Try it on grilled fish for something a little different."
1,"I first discovered Pepper Plant when I was living in Northern California and since then I have relocated to Southern California and now Marietta, Gerogia and each place I have had cases of Pepper Plant shipped to me. This the best hot sauce because of it's flavor and consistancy. It has a thick consistancy, so it doesn't run all over everything, stays were you put it on your food. Eggs, Stews, Bloody Mary's and on meats is all good."
1,"We discovered this sauce, the Original California Hot Sauce, while staying at a hotel on Monterey Bay in Sand City, CA in September 2008. We loved it as soon as we tried it. Brought a bottle home and now it's history. Glad to see we can buy more and enjoy our little taste of California again and again.<br /><br />This sauce isn't like other hot sauces where you get an intense burn, it has a nice heat tingle and great taste. We have never tasted a sauce similar to this so we have nothing to compare it too. Try this sauce and we are sure that it will be one of your favorites too."
1,"We have been using this stuff for years even though we have to buy it online. We buy it by the 12 pack and like the other reviewers, it is a staple here - almost it's own food group. For the best nachos - lay out a bunch of Mission Tortilla strips in a toaster (about an inch high), with a ""healthy"" amount of shreaded cheese on top - toast one cycle, then sprinkle the sauce over the top. The best."
1,This hot sauce has a complex flavor that goes with just about everything. I particularly like it with broccoli in cheese sauce! I've also had it on pork chops and buffalo chicken. It's zesty without being a wallop of peppery heat. Highly recommended!
1,"This hot pepper sauce maybe among the best in the market !!<br />Excellent with meats , seafood."
1,"I tasted this at the Olive Pit in Corning, CA on an olive burger this summer and I couldn't get over it.  I eat a lot of hot sauce and I believe this is the best I've ever tasted.  It is now a staple in my fridge."
1,Oh man!  There is not much to be said about this sauce apart from Wow!  The Pepper Plant Hot Sauce - 'Practically Perfect Hot Pepper Sauce' - does anyone have a straw?
1,"I've been using Pepper Plant ever since I attended Cal Poly on the Central CA coast in the late 90's.  I usually order it now in bulk and pass it along to friends.  Every single one of them has become a convert and we are all addicted!  I'm not sure I could live without this sauce.  It is amazing on nachos, breakfast burritos, in chilis, you name it!<br /><br />For those of you that may be a little timid to try a ""hot sauce""; this is definitely the sauce to try!  It is spicy, but the flavor is so full and bold that you'll forget about the ""hot.""<br /><br />I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to try a hot sauce.  It really is the best sauce on the market."
1,"This is the most flavorful sauce with great consistency.  Not watery or vinegary.  Could almost be used as a thin salsa, but it is great on eggs, burgers, and anything else you might put hot sauce on.  I buy it by the case now."
1,"I tried this sauce at a restaurant and was immediately hooked. The sauce is no ordinary hot sauce. It does pack a little bit of spice, but what really does it for me is the hints of garlic. A good purchase to add to anyone's hot sauce collection."
1,"This hot sauce is most unlike any other sauce I have ever had. It is chunky and thick and really a cross between a hot sauce and a salsa. The flavor is phenomenal. It is to ""too hot"" but has enough kick and flavor to make just about anything taste better. There is just enough garlic in the sauce that you can taste it, without garlic dominating the taste. I use it more like most people would use ketchup. It's great on eggs, omlets, pizza, or even pasta.  I just wish they had a slightly larger bottle. I go through about a bottle every 1-2 weeks!"
1,"I was recently gifted my first bottle of the Pepper Plant Original CA style hot sauce. Good garlicy/chili nose when opening the bottle. The chili flavor is very present (2-star heat), followed by the garlic. Balanced ""heat"" & flavors. Not too vinegary or salty. It reminds me of a ""Southwest Sriracha"". Makes a good everyday table sauce."
1,"This has to be my favorite type of hot pepper sauce. The problem with it is that I go through it too fast! Some people might find it to be too salty compared to other hot pepper sauces, but I enjoy it and wouldn't change a thing about it. It has the perfect blend of spice and heat, and goes great on everything. Do yourself a favor and give it a whirl!"
1,"Hands down my favorite sauce, especially for Mexican food, eggs and stews. It has become a staple in our kitchen."
1,"Taylor's Market is the best.  This product is versatile and a medium heat.  Goes so well with odd things, like baked potatoes, fresh trout w/lemon and pepper, nachoes, chicken wings galore, barbecued hamburgers."
1,"I love hot, and I love this great tasting Pepper Sauce.  I can't buy it in the store in Reno, so I buy it online!  I went through my first bottle in 2 weeks because it's great on everything!  I am buying and giving to my friends and family as well.  We are hooked, and wish I could buy it in the grocery store because I can only buy it when I'm buying something else from Amazon, because I refuse to pay more for shipping than I do the product!  It would be 5 stars if the shipping were free!"
1,"I use this prod on chicken,burritos,eggs it has a great taste cant get enough of it you should try it for your self."
1,"The product is awesome, I moved out of California and could not purchase it where I currently live.  My husband loves it so I was so thrilled to find I could order it on Amazon.  I gave him a case for his birthday."
1,Since my daughter moved to the east coast - she can't find her favorite hot sauce!  So - Amazon supplied the means of getting it to her - and she says it is great as always!
1,"I love me my hot sauces, but I am often disappointed by sauces that go for pure spicy kick at the expense of flavor. This sauce, however, has the most amazing balance of spice and flavor of any sauce I have ever tried. A little tart, but not too vinegary. A little smoky, but doesn't taste like it had artificial smoke flavor added. Good amount of spice warms the tongue but doesn't kill the taste of the rest of the sauce, or the food. Although I've lived in California my whole life, I only discovered this stuff recently, but I am committed to keeping it around my kitchen from here on out."
1,"Being from the central coast Pepper Plant sauce is EVERYwhere. On most restaurant tables, stores, etc. I love it. I make a wicked carnitas style pork using just pepper plant sauce and my crock pot. It's also really good on chicken. If you think the original sauce is good, try the Garlic version. It's supreme! and makes yummy buffalo style chicken wings!"
1,"I'm not generally a fan of hot sauces.  However, when I initially came across this in a diner I gave it a sniff, and it smelled promising.  It was quite good with my steak that morning.  Now that I have it at home, I will admit it's a touch salty, but the flavor is quite savory in comparison to your run-of-the-mill hot sauces."
1,"We first tried this sauce in July when we stopped for lunch at Big Sur, as we drove down the coast road. I was amazed at the unique taste. It is rich, a little bit spicy, and unlike any other pepper sauce I've tried (I love salsas). We bought a couple bottles for home, but they didn't last long. This stuff goes great with eggs, chicken, vegetables, etc. I've never seen it in a local store in southern California, and wasn't planning another central Cal drive, so I was very happy to find it available online. I ordered it with a couple other items from Taylor's market. On my first order, they made a mistake on one of the items, but told me to just keep the mistake and then quickly sent the correct item."
1,"The California Style Hot Pepper Sauce is perfect for my palate. It is not industrial strength hot but a perfect blend of taste and spice easy to enjoy. Unless you insist on ""napalm in a bottle"" you will like the middle of the road flavor."
1,This is not for the faint at heart. Use sparingly till you find how much you can tolerate. Trust me its extremely hot. One note.... the after taste is a bit different. I wouldnt call it bitter. Maybe call it a dull taste. I have found that the dull taste disappears if used with other strong flavors ( not nessesarily hot ones) Those additional flavors mask that kind of dull taste of the Ghost Chile flakes. Curry or Cumon are great spices to use with the flakes. Good luck.... check your will before your try this!!!!
1,Just licking the dust off of the freshness seal set my mouth on fire! These aren't the sissy hot pepper flakes you find at a pizza shop.
1,This is a great Hot pepper  the Ghost pepper has a unique flavor other than just being hot  and the heat creeps up on you after a little while
1,"I have an extremely picky yorkshire terrier, and he goes nuts over these treats. I have his full attention during training if I use these.<br /><br />One comment: the treats are too big for my dog (he is four pounds). I broke them up with a hammer to make them small enough. On the positive side, that means that one bag lasts forever."
1,I have two Bichons and they absolutely loved these.  I gave four stars because I wish the price was lower.  With two dogs one package doesn't last long at one a day.
1,We found that cutting up the sticks and add them to our dog's wet dog food for dinner she will eat them.
0,"We have purchased this product before from the same seller (AWORLDOFPUPS) and received a wonderful dog treat that was soft enough to break into multiple treat size pieces. My puppies absolutely loved them. We ordered another batch when we quickly ran out and this time we received very hard, dry sticks that would snap in half with a great deal of pressure but did not appear to be safe enough for my 20lb puppies to eat. We did give them one half of a treat each and were amazed at how LONG it took them to chew threw this small piece of treat. These are dogs that usually can chew through anything quite quickly. I held off writing a negative review until I heard back from the company. However their policy is that I must pay for the shipping on the return and I can not return anything opened. After numerous emails back and forth they appear to be unconcerned (at least they have not commented on) the fact that this particular bag appears to be defective and unsafe for consumption. The lamination on the bag itself arrived peeling. Upon closer inspection the product is made in China so the lack of quality control is not surprising, however the lack of concern and willingness to take responsibility by the seller is. We will be looking for new treats elsewhere. We are very disappointed; the first batch we received was great. I'm giving two stars instead of one because the first bag was fantastic as were the other treats in the same collection."
1,"This took an extremly long time to get after I ordered it, but my puppy absolutely loves them, and they are very healthy for her bone and joint development! Less likly to choke on the sticks they are softer than the jerky, but she loves all the Loving Pet products, even the jerky, but reccomend keeping a close eye on them with the jerky. Great all natural product line!"
0,"Package claims these treats are soft, marketing towards very young and senior dogs.<br />I used the treat as a back up hammer!!!!!  Three different packages, all with the same results.<br />I expected ""Gourmet Treats"" were just that, based on the cost.....Buyer beware!!!!"
1,"This is a deep, rich coffee that holds up with the largest cup sizing. Not bitter. And I like to brew this on the smallest size to make espresso as its strong enough to be be an easy, passable espresso."
0,"When I first opened the bottle it smelled medicinal. I added it to some iced tea and it tasted just like it smelled, very medicinal and only a trace of fruit flaver. I ordered 2 other flavors and they're the same. I gave it an extra star because service is good, but I can't recommend the extract."
0,"If I could give this no stars - that is how I would rate it.  Called extract, but is, in fact, artificial.  Misleading information - no indication in the detail that this is an artificial flavoring - be warned.  Only realised when I actually received the item.  Learn by my mistake."
0,"I ordered primarily peach(16oz) bottle to make ice tea. It had very little peach flavor, and smelled like propylene glycol(the agent they use to carry the flavor.) I added an ounce of flavoring to 1 gal and still didnt get a peach flavor to the tea.The other 3 flavors were also very poor quality. They definitely are not""extracts"", so I returned them all."
1,This product arrived quickly and in good condition.  The flavor is definitely peach and I use it to flavor my tea.
1,This product worked out so good for me!  I was making Peach Butter and need a little more peach flavor ... fantastic!
1,"These are great candy bars. We can't usually get them on the West Coast, here in CA, so that is why I ordered some online. They are my husband's favorite. I got him the box for Christmas. The price was good and the candy is fresh and delicious. I definitely will buy from this seller again and recommend them."
1,"I would like to thank you for having my favorite childhood candy, Zagnut.  It has been more years than I care to say that I have had Zagnut.  I got my 26 year old nephew and 15 year old niece to like the Zagnut.  I had seen the candies from the time of my parents and unfortunately neither are here to have me order the candy for them.  I plan on ordering more Zagnut and other products from Amazon."
1,"This is the best coconut juice I have ever had, great taste, natural.  No sugar added.  I drink this coconut juice after yoga practice and during my long driving time."
1,"I like the clean sweet flavor of this coconut juice. No off flavor aftertaste. I've probably tried 90% of all coconut waters commercially available in the United States. I usually rate them by garbage, bad, okay, and superior. This coconut water would fall under the superior category."
1,I purchased these for our overweight dog based on vet's recommendation.  Cut back on food and give her green bean's as a filler.  (Who knew dogs love green beans)?  I paid about $.60 a can!  Don't think you can beat that price and UPS puts them right at your front door!
0,Every can in the case looked as if it had been drop kicked and thrown. Had I known this would be the condition I never would have purchased it.
0,"Upon reading the reviews for this product, I was excited to try them. I was sadly disappointed. The honey sesame roast tasted burned. I was not impressed with any of the varieties."
1,I think sassafras is very underrated.  This candy is very good.  If you like sassafras and / or rootbeer I highly recommend that you try this.
1,"These are great, the perfect size and gluten free. I keep one with me always for those times when you feel like you're going to kill someone if you don't get some food soon. Preventing murders everywhere. Deliciously."
1,"My daughter is 1 year old and LOVES these! She can't get enough. Perfect size for her and great as a snack to take on the road. My only complaint is that they are very sticky and when I break off pieces for her, if she drops any of it, it STICKS. So I have little bits of theses bars stuck all over the place, but she loves them so we keep buying them!"
1,Junior size Bumble bars are just right to stave off  an energy drop.  Fewer calories and great flavors.<br />I carry these with me all the time.
1,My three year old daughter loves these.  I eat the larger ones and I got these smaller ones for her.  They are a perfect size for her tummy.  She thinks they are cookies!
1,I have been a fan of Bumble Bars for several years.  The smaller junior size is very convenient and quite nice as an afternoon snack.
1,"Wow, these got stuck between every tooth in my mouth but were very tasty and amazingly filling for how small they are.  Brush well and they are good."
1,"My little yorkie loves this food. He has allergies, and when he eats this food they seem to improve. I do have to crush them into smaller pieces for him though."
1,This was a gift to my brother-in-law.  A true New Yorker where pepperoni wins hands down.  Have not heard from him yet but I am sure the product is good.  Arrived in a fast manner and well packed.
1,"Really good , has a different taste then most, could see how many people wouldn't like it. Yes i really like it."
1,"It started in middle school, everytime we went on a class trip I got a bag of circus peanuts for the ride. Twenty years later, it is a C-stop necessity! They are just as I remember, chewy and chock full of sugar. Sathers is the only!"
0,Not as good as Bigelow Fruit & Almond. It tasted more like apple than anything else. Also this is a loose tea but in one part of the description it mentioned bags. I have the stainless loose tea thing so I had no issue w/ it being loose. Just not as Almond tasting as Bigelow which you have to buy in bulk from Bigelow directly now.
1,"We ordered this arrangement and it was beautiful. Great colors, fresh flowers and delivered early in the day so the recipient could enjoy all day long. Excellent service.  Will definitely keep using this seller in the future."
1,"I was so happy with the flowers that arrived today for my aunt.  The flowers were so beautiful!  I received updates consistently so I didn't even have to follow up.  The flowers got there at exactly the right time.  I couldn't be happier with my order. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037BOK3C"">Flowers - Fields of Europe Arrangement - Large</a>"
0,"1-800-flowers.com RUINED A 90TH BIRTHDAY gift!! I ordered flowers on Tuesday for a Friday delivery for Mom's 90th birthday party.  Due to health issues my husband and I were unable to travel so we ordered a flower arrangement that was made to look like a birthday cake with candles.  The ad listed the flowers as available for next day delivery so I assumed that meant something like this was kept on hand.  I ordered the arrangement 3 days in advance just to make sure (or so I thought) they would be there!  I looked at several flower sites and we liked the colors and flowers of this arrangement the best.  My brothers and sisters were giving Mom a party at the apartment complex where she lives so since we couldn't be there I thought this would at least let them know we were there in spirit.  I got a call Friday afternoon from customer service telling me the flowers could not be delivered.  They said they could delivery some flowers Saturday, but not the flowers I had originally ordered.  I ordered 3 days ahead of time!!  You would think if they weren't available they would call prior to the day they were supposed to be delivered?  That way I could have made other arrangements.  I would have even considered picking out something different if that meant getting them there ontime.  The site says ""100% satisfaction guaranteed"".  I am not at all satisfied because what good is it to have flowered delivered the day after you need them???  They are supposedly crediting my credit card but they didn't know how long that would take.  I will definitely be writing more if that doesn't happen.  I have bought many many flowers online and never had a problem until now.  I am very dissatisfied with 1-800-flowers.com and will make sure everyone I come in contact with will know they are not reliable to get flowers there ontime!"
1,"""My experience with the seller was outstanding. The arrangment arrived the day I had chosen, and my mother was both surprised and thrilled to receive such a beautifully creative arrangement. The flowers were very fresh and plentiful for the price. I will definitely order from this seller again!"""
1,"I've ordered this arrangement many times for a number of people including; mother, step-mother, Grandma, aunts, father, people recovering from operations.  They all say the same thing: it's beautiful."
0,"3 orders not one of them good!  First roses sent to me (day after my 2 orders), mailed to me even though there are florist who work with them in town.  110 degree heat the boxed flowers have no moisture inside - no water caps or even moist towelettes just cut flowers open on the ends with a plastic open wrap around the top.  Well they were wilted, brown and gross!  Smelled of MOLD!  Called they fed ex'd another batch, mold free but tired looking never really looked any better after water.  Local grocery store better flowers at 1/3 cost!  2nd order I made for relative.  Days later got a call that they can't fill the order as requested, made changes to order supposed to get gift certificate for the problem.  Just found out the order never arrived - from the intended recipient!  Called them, all of the sudden emails arrive (while i'm on the phone) saying they have a problem and I need to contact them (after the delivery date)  the emails have a date stamp when they were sent but the typed in date was days before - really?!  How moronic, I can tell when you sent the email - it has a date stamp!  Anyway they claim they tried to call and left messages - I have caller ID and voice mail - THEY DID NOT CALL!  So no flowers for my relative oh but they will mail something (of their choosing) out today for them - gee thanks late and lame Hope it's not a funeral wreath.  They missed the b-day so now it just doesn't matter anymore.  Plus that gift coupon for $20 they were 'emailing' oh well now when I ask where that is - oh well I guess we mailed it and you will get it in about 6 weeks.  Seriously???  How are you sending it? Pony express?? Is someone walking it to me??  They failed, lied and tried to make it look like they did what they said.  Unbelievable!  Oh but we are not done...  Order number 3 (made at same time as order 2) I though i better ask if that one delivered ok...they say 'What order?'  They claim they have no order.  It's on the same receipt as the previous one - paid the same time.  They totally missed that one but they won't even refund my money until I send them a copy of my receipt. MY RECEIPT?  Are you serious, they don't have a record of it ?  I paid with paypal, they have that and with the order number they should have the original full order that includes all this mess we have been dealing with for the other one.  Never in my life has a national company so screwed up - repeatedly.  The only orders these morons can get right are the ones that actually make it to a good local florist then anything that goes right is the florist not 1-800-flowers.<br />Do yourself a HUGE favor - find the nearest florist or floral department in a store (many will deliver), call them and place your order - any online map service or phone service will help you.  Do not ever use 1-800-flowers!!!"
0,"I ordered the large version of Fields of Europe, the orange rose version. While the flowers are ""close"" I really didn't want pink roses. If I wanted pink roses I would have ordered that bouquet instead. I was hoping for something that really popped of summer, not a springy love bouquet. For the price, they should send you what you order and not just make it up and hope for the best. I've ordered lots of flowers through 1800flowers and I think from now on I will find someone else! Just disappointed that something that cost $75 would come looking closer to what I was wanting."
0,"FALSE advertisement alert!  Amazon deal for $15 voucher for $30 credit at 1800Flowers, does not list the $20 service fee!!!!!! This company does not offer full disclosure of billing.  Use with caution!!!"
0,"I ordered the 50 blossom rose bouquet for my husband's birthday.  The flowers arrived on time, but in poor condition.  They were tiny, dried out, and several of the buds had fallen off the stems.  I'd have done better at the local supermarket."
1,I have been feeding this to my sled dogs for about 6 years now. They all have done great on this. Packed full of nutrition so they don't need to eat a lot and they maintain a good body weight. I would recommend this product for any sporting dog.
1,"We purchase the small cans to give our fussy dog just the right size serving for breakfast. I worry that this company might change their formula one day. Tip for fussy dogs? Start with this product or a treat and then see if REX will switch to a top dry food. Our dog eats this and then wants something else because he is still hungry (OK, yes, I did switch to dinner). Keep mixing the variety for REX, the spoiled. and even offer a few different dry selections to MR. FUSSY. Do not try to just feed Mr. Fussy duck. Mix it up."
1,"I love this brand of chews for my Shih Tzu. They do not come apart easily so she really just chews on one for hours. Other brands that I have purchased in the past break apart and she chokes on them. Some other brands she actually tries to swallow whole, but not with these. She just chews on them and bites off little pieces at a time. I will not give her any other raw hide chews. These are the best."
1,"I live with about 1000mg a day of sodium in my diet.  It is crucial that I stay within my limits or else I suffer the consequences the next day and it's not pretty.  Mrs. Dash seasoning, especially the Fiesta Lime, I've found is one of the best seasonings I've come across so far.  Light, spicy and flavorful.  Try it you'll like it."
1,I got hooked on these babies when I was stationed in Japan 40 years ago.  They are addictive....  Try them once and you will be hooked.  The delivery was quick and the product was as advertised.  I would buy from this vendor again.
1,"baked, tastes like shrimp, and so much better then a regular potatoe chip, they're extremely addicting so be warned. But they taste amazing and go really well as a side with some ramen."
1,These are great when you are looking for something other than your average potato chip. They aren't too greasy and they are full of flavor. Add a  Ramune drink (Japanese soft drink...I like the lychee fruit flavor) and you've got a delicious snack!
1,"Two good things are apparent about these snacks right away, they arent round like the typical chip, but are more shaped like 'fries' making them easier to eat; and you can clearly taste the shrimp flavor but it's more delicate than some snacks, so the taste is not over whelming or too salty- even though there is some MSG included on the ingredient list.  The consistancy is also quite nice, there is a crunch to them, but the chips arent so hard as if you're chewing glass or some foreign matter; eating these won't make sensitive teeth hurt. They also come in a four ounce bag; enough to satisfy but not make you feel bloated and easy to count calories if you care about such things.  If you like your snacks with a seafood taste there really isn't a downside to this brand.  Enjoy.  Hope this helps."
1,It's hard for me to limit myself to one bag per day. Extremely good tasting and a bag feels as if you are eating more than four oz. Hard to describe the taste but much better than potato chips.
1,"I was debating on whether to share my first bar with a friend because I wasn't so hungry at the time.  We were in a walmart waiting in line to purchase the delicious Kinder Bueno.  Upon hearing our dilemma, the lady waiting in line in front of us told us that it was imperative that we get our own bars because there wasn't enough in one bar to share.  Based on her persistence, we both got our own bars and have never looked back since.  Thank you Kinder Bueno!"
1,"We got a 6oz sample in the mail.  We use them as treats for our 10 pound, 13 year old miniature fox terrier. She still eats them like they are kibble crack.  The best thing was there were NO digestive issues adding them to her diet, no getting sick in any way.  And I really like the idea that they are lower in calorie as well as nutritious.

1,"Now this is the way homestyle pasta should be.  This is a delicious, classic pasta salad to make and the kids will like the different colors and twists.  It will only take 17 minutes to make until you put it on the table.  Just follow the easy directions on the back.<br />  Health Hint: May I suggest, instead of adding vegetable oil, use 1 or 2 tablespoons of Extra Virgin Olive Oil instead."
1,"Around three years ago me, my college room mate Kenny, and my girlfriend went on a cross-country roadtrip to hang out in Kenny's uncle's condo at a ski resort during the summer.  Now, Kenny's uncle Rodney is a weird dude to be sure, and in retrospect we should have known something was up when he invited three college students to stay with him in the wilderness for a week, but at the time we were just excited for an adventure and a free place to stay.  It took us almost a whole day to find the play when we got nearby; it was in the middle of podunk nowhere and there was nobody to ask directions of because the ski resort was deserted during the summer.  By the time we got there it was already dark, but Rodney welcomed us and provided us with booze.  We were content until we realized that we were starving, that Rodney's condo was out of food, and we were all too smashed to go get any.  I was distraught until he assured me that ""there would be plenty of food tomorrow,"" while discreetly watching Angela (my girlfriend) out of the corner of his eye.  Soon, we were all passed out in Rodney's guest rooms.  I distinctly remember Angela getting up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom (I assumed), and thought no more of it until I awoke at 4:00AM alone, and the bathroom was empty.  I went and found Kenny, and hungover and starving we went in search of the two missing members of our party.  It was dawn when we smelled it: an unearthly aroma wafting through the house and tempting our taste buds.  The smell got stronger as we approached the boiler room door in the basement.  We began to open the door when Suddenly Pasta Salad! The entire room was filled with it!<br /><br />We never saw Rodney or Angela again, but we visit that condo for the pasta salad in that delicious room every summer."
1,Love this It is so easy ...Sometimes I throw some cubed chicken in this and make a meal out of it great for a side dish.
1,Awesome base product!  You can cook it up and serve it just as directed or add anything that you can imagine.  I like to add some chopped tomato/garlic/onion blend and some drained chuck chicken - yum!!!!
1,"I tried this stuff after seeing it in a bodega in my new town. I had just moved. I had never seen it before so I figured new town, new foods. Why not? At first I was pretty worried because the guy at the counter stared at the box for a long time like he couldn't figure out something and then he made this really scared face at it and didn't say anything. Still, it was surprisingly good for the price!<br /><br />I went back for more the next day and the place was totally gone! There was just an empty lot and when I asked someone walking by if they knew where the place was, they said that there used to be a bodega there but it burned down 20 years ago. So, no luck there! I hope I can find that place again because they had some other cool stuff and even some antiques."
1,"I love this pasta salad!!!  I've never made my own pasta salad, but I sometimes buy the already made stuff at the grocery.  But this is even better because I just store them in my pantry for a rainy day.  I always have a can of black sliced olives on hand to add. I also buy grape tomatoes and Sorento Mozzarella cheese. I usually make this just for myself and eat it for the following 3 days. Tastes better once it's been cooled.  Haven't tried the other flavors yet because I'm still stuck on this one."
1,"This salad is so good, we eat it at least once a week. And -- I am in no way working for anyone associated with this product. I am a real mom with 4 growing sons. After heading to the local Wal-mart to get food supplies, I came home with my receipt in hand and compared the prices to Amazon's. These boxes came out to be 2 cents less then at Wal-mart, and they are delivered to my house free of charge. Can't beat that!"
1,My son is addicted to this pasta.  I use olive oil and put a can of sliced olives in.  Amazon delivers fresh dated product at a great price.
1,"My daughter and son-in-law, who are very busy, love Classic Suddenly Salad.  They like tasty pasta dishes, and they keep an assortment of Suddenly Salads on hand.  When they have time they make wonderful pasta salad from scratch, but they need some dishes that are tasty and quick.<br /><br />They use olive oil.  They like to add some carrots for crunch, some ham, and some cubes of cheese. The stir-ins suggested on the box sound great:  pepperoni slices, mozarella cheese cubes, sliced and drained ripe olives, halved zucchini slices, chopped roma tomatoes, and sunflower seeds.<br /><br />A neat recipe on the box suggests adding frozen and cooked broccoli, carrots,and cauliflower along with some sliced ripe olives.<br /><br />The possiblities are numerous."
1,The product is of high quality.  I am truly satisfied with the product itself and the service I received from the company I purchased it from.
1,"This is by far the best no carb condiment! Tastes great with lo carb veggies like celery, and on hard boiled eggs. It can be addictive though! I can go through one jar in two days if I don't watch it. And its perfect for teas, parties etc....because everyone LOVES it too! Try it! Best find for me in 2011!"
1,"Love fig newtons!  These are really fresh individually sealed, unlike their 1lb counterpart packages that have a tendency to get stale rather quickly.  These are worth the extra cost for that reason alone.  But, they're grab and go snacks too that are somewhat healthy for you than a regular cookie.  They also make great treats for after ballgames and other sports.  We love these in our house, highly recommend!"
1,Most people have had these at sometime in their life so no need to tell you how good they are. Only problem is - when getting this quantity it is hard not to eat them continuously!  Too bad the calories can't be quartered :)
1,I love these individual size snacks. These packets are portable and (at least in my case) keep me from eating too many fig newtons.<br /><br />The only thing I would appreciate is if Amazon would give you an idea of when these items will expire. I really hate wasting food but I can't possibly eat a couple of boxes of fig newtons in a month.
1,"I like Fig Newtons and have been missing them since I cut out white flour and enriched flour from my diet. These are made with whole grain and taste very good. The reason I can't give them five stars is because even though the advertisement does not list ""high fructose corn syrup"" as an ingredient, the actual nutrition label does. This is an ingredient that I try not to have in my food, but it is getting very difficult to find products that don't contain it."
1,"I demand you to eat more of this product ... Soon, this item will be mandated by your government to be consumed by all ...  cause it's sooooo damn good!!!"
1,"Arrived fresh.  Handy packaging.  I take them with me on longer bike rides.  Give me as much fuel as a Powerbar or whatever, cost a lot less."
0,I should've listened to other reviewers when they said these things are dry. They are very dry and taste nothing like the fig newtons I'm used to. Too bad they couldn't successfully merge the fig newton with whole grains. It just doesn't work
0,"I love Fig Newtons and so does my 7 year old, so I thought I'd try the minis in a convenient size. Unfortunately they don't taste very good. There is hardly any fig inside and they're a bit dry. I'll opt for the regular size Newtons the next time I buy them."
1,If you are like me you love fig newtons but they are so sweet you get tired of them fast. This way the opened bigger boxes aren't left to get stale.
1,"While not readily available in many markets, the fat free fig newtons are an excellent dessert alternative for those trying to lower chlosterol without drugs. Very tasty and satisfying. The price and free shipping save us about 30% at Amazon compared to the Safeway market. Almost time for another case!"
0,"Whole Grain Wheat Flour, Figs Preserved With Sulfur Dioxide, Sugar, **Corn Syrup, **High Fructose Corn Syrup, Soybean Oil, **Partially Hydrogenated Cottonseed Oil, Salt, Cultured Dextrose And Potassium Sorbate Added To Preserve Freshness, Baking Soda, Soy Lecithin (Emulsifier), Natural And Artificial Flavor.

1,"WHILE WATCHING TV, I LOVE A GOOD SNACK TO HELP PASS THE TIME. A GOOD LOW FAT FIG NEWTON WILL HIT THE SPOT. I'VE ALWAYS LOVED FIG NEWTONS IN THE PAST AND STILL DO NOW. WITH A LW FAT VANILLA MILK, AM IN BUSINESS WITH A REMOTE CONTROL IN MY HANDS."
0,the jam inside feels cheap and don't like the taste. thought the rate on amazon was pretty good but feel disappointed.
1,Fig Newtons are so good that I always keep them on hand. Just right for a quick and delicious snack or for a small dessert after a nice meal.
1,It's a ton of fig newtons so how can you go wrong. If you've never had a Fig Newton then you owe it to yourself to try them. It is its own unique flavor and texture.
1,"I have to stay for long hours at school, and I've been looking for snacks I can bring that aren't too unhealthy. When I found out about these fig newton minis, I was pretty excited since I absolutely love the full size fig newtons. Since they're smaller, there is of course much less of the fruit filling.. but still, a delicious snack. The size of each individual bag is quite small (a little over 1oz) so it's not too great at staving off those hunger pangs, but it helps."
1,This was our regular purchase item from grocery store. Subscribe and Save saved me time and $ . Loved it
1,just enough when you want a little something. i think we've all ate this as kids and it's easy to carry around
1,These are very good bars and being individually wrapped stay fresh a long time. My husband carries them in his car for a quick and easy snack.
1,"These are Fig Newtons, what can you say?  Everyone likes them (or not).  They are a nice-sized snack in a nearly indestructible foil wrapper.  You get two double-length cookies, approximately equivalent to 4 regular Fig Newtons.  Good for tossing in lunches, purses, the car, etc.  Arrived very fresh and in good shape.  Handy as a somewhat more nutritious snack.  We like them enough to order more, when on sale!"
1,love me some Newtons and I can eat these in bunches and never stop. they are so good. i have dug them from way back in the day and they are a must for me everytime.
1,"When you have a family that loves fig newtons as much as mine, it is best to buy them by the case than depend<br />on grocery store sales which don't happen often on these cookies.  They are still the best quality with the most<br />filling and crunch of any fig cookies on the market so they are worth the extra expense over cheap no-name<br />brands."
1,"This was a great deal online. My son loves fig newtons. I bought two boxes a while ago and they're perfect for breakfast, on the run, and for running errands. I throw the pack in my purse, keep some in the car, and in my sons bag."
1,"If this is the first time you've considered tasting a Fig Newton then, Welcome to; America, planet Earth, or back from the dead. Nabisco has been baking these little gems for over 100 years and they are a part of American culture. If you actually haven't tried a ""Newton"" they are small cookies that consist of a soft cake outer sleeve with sweet fig jam in the middle. These packages are half the size of a regular package of newtons and come in a rigid plastic tray, inside a plastic bag, inside a small cardboard box. These were fresh and well within the ""best by"" date."
0,"I bought these wipes a month ago and used them every day for a week before tossing them in the trash.  We live in a wooded environment and there are areas where water stands for awhile after it rains.  Mosquito's are everywhere and our only break from them is during the Winter season.  We've tried everything and the only two things that work for us are full coverage clothing and the dark green spray bottle of OFF Deep Woods Repellent.<br /><br />For these particular wipes, we used one wipe per person before going outdoors.  Mosquito's began attacking us immediately.  We returned indoors to use more wipes in case one wipe per person wasn't enough.  The mosquitos still attacked.  So we returned indoors to shower up and apply our anti-itch bug cream.  I continued to go out every day for the rest of the week using these wipes and the same thing kept happening no matter how many wipes I used.<br /><br />My youngest is allergic to Mosquito bites so it's a big deal that we have a good repellent.  She's been to the hospital for mosquito bites (how we found out she was allergic) and has to be put on antibiotics to prevent her skin from becoming necrotic.  Our Pediatrician said that while there is a lot of debate on whether to put Deet containing products on young children, she suggests doing so carefully and properly which we have done.  Once I tossed these wipes, I purchased OFF Deep Woods Repellent Spray.  It's in a dark green bottle with an orange pump top.  That product has worked excellent for us and my youngest hasn't been bitten.<br /><br />I think the idea of wipes is nice for a few reasons but we're going to stick with the bottle of spray.  These wipes may work for others but they didn't work for us."
1,"i bought these last summer, and absolutely loved them because i never got a bite when i used it (i usually use 2 if i'm scantily clad). i live in texas, and mosquitoes LOVE to bite me. i'm slightly allergic, and the bites stay around for weeks, so it was such a relief to find this product. i like it much more than the spray bottle because i feel i can cover all of my skin.<br />i prefer it to the off! brand of wipes because i like the smell better. this has less DEET than the 'off! deep woods' one, but i really dislike the super-strong smell of that one, and for normal use, 7% DEET is plenty.<br />if you are in the woods, though, i would recommend products with more DEET. i use this for outdoor festivals and parties at night."
1,My two year old son is severely allergic to mosquito bites. Within minutes the bites open like a soar and begin to oozz. They last for days and usually leave scars so we need something to keep the msquitos away and these cutter wipes have been great. We live in a hot humid climate so we have mosqitos almost year around. Every time we apply the wipes he has stayed bite free. We love the wipes because we don't have to spray anything that could possibly get in his eyes. I can't say enough about these wipes!!!
1,"I use these in a primarily urban environment and around parks that have mosquitos. They work well as a repellant for our family. The wipes are much more convenient to pack on trips and to give to children to apply to themselves. I always keep some of these around, and will buy more as long as they keep selling them. I bought on Amazon because my local stores were no longer selling the wipes."
1,"My son hates being sprayed (bug or sunscreen spray). He spends most of his day outside at daycare and mosquitoes find him very sweet.  Now that West Nile has become such an issue here, I am meticulous on making sure he is covered.  These wipes (along with buggy bands) have worked perfectly.  I just wipe him down as he is having breakfast every morning and he is set for the day."
1,"I purchased this to take with me on a trip to Thailand.  I didn't want a lot of liquids or sprays in my luggage.  I kept it in a Ziploc bag, just to be on the safe side, and had no problems with leaks.  It worked as expected.  When we used it, we didn't get bit by mosquitos.  When we didn't use it, we did.  What more could you ask for?"
0,"That's right. Only ONE pack in the box and cost me $8. I used to buy 8-pack of this noddle for $7 on Amazon and this is the first time I write a bad review about the product on Amazon. Never mind, lesson learned. I really should look at the details about this product before your purchase!!!"
0,"I should have read the description more carefully... I am so used to buying a case of 8 for the same price that I just bought this item. Much to my surprise, the very small package of 1 arrived a few days later. I was not pleased. Then again, there was no mention of an entire case being sold.<br />BEWARE!"
1,This is a great product. Makes wonderful Bloody Marys Just the right amount of kick with the right flavour.I have recommend this to several friends.
0,"I am a long time fan of Clamato juice as just a juice drink or as a base for my Bloody Marys' and was intrigued by the possible ""spiciness"" of this new product.<br /><br />I was sorely disappointed by the lack of ""spiciness"".  I still had to add my usual suspects to bring it up to the level I'm used to when using regular Clamato.<br /><br />It's not that I will stop buying Clamato, but I think I will just stick to the old variety.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Maria Roemer"
1,Picante Clamato juice is just right for a breakfast juice drink. Just enough bite for a good flavor and wake up your taster.
0,"I love PG Tips, but Online Stores Inc sent me 4 boxes that were one month away from their expiration date and when I sent them back and asked for a refund, they did not give me a full refund.  They charged me for the box that I opened to try the tea (it was stale and tasted like hay) and then charged me for the postage.  They did reimburse me for 3 packs and the return postage.  They did not respond when I wrote them after not receiving a full refund.<br /><br />All around, not a great merchant experience and I would not buy from them again."
1,"I found these cheese straws by accident and decided to try them, oh boy are they what I call ""moorish"" I cannot stop eating them. I can eat a lot of them and still lose weight on my low carb program. I have to wait approximately a week for them to arrive, but I do order 4 tins at a time, they are sooooooooo delicious. I just love them. I have so far not experienced issues with shipping, I send the order through ""one click"" and a week later the order is on my doorstep. I am an addict!"
1,"These cheese bites are absolutely delicious.  I would eat them even if I hadn't given up carbs for lent.<br /><br />Unlike the other reviewer, I had zero shipping issues.  Arrived less than a week from date of order.<br /><br />If I had to give one negative it would be that there's no nutritional information on the package, so I don't know if Lizzie's definition of low card is the same as mine."
1,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CULITU"">Hershey's Syrup, Special Dark Chocolate, 22-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />Love this stuff, great for making Mocha's, clod or hot. Was buying at The ""Big W"", but of course, they've stopped carrying it. And it is seemly more difficult, if not impossible, to find from other sources. Is a message being sent? But, for the moment, it is here at Amazon.<br /><br />It may not be as dark as some would like, but it is not as sweet as their regular chocolate syrup and tastes similar to the Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate candies.<br /><br />When I ordered from Amazon the Subscribe and Save pricing was an excellent buy, making this chocolate lovers syrup even more SPECIAL.<br /><br />May the chocolate, dark that is, be with you..."
1,I moved to the Northwest and there is no store here that carries the dark Hershey syrup.  Now I have six of them. Happy's the word!
1,Closest thing to Starbucks chocolate syrup you can find. I have been looking for a chocolate that mimics Starbucks forever.  Finally found it!
1,"These grits are excellent.  Amazon, in their product description says that ""hominy grits are coarsely ground hominy or corn"".  That statement is incorrect.  Hominy IS corn...that has the germ removed and is soaked in a weak lye solution.<br />Grits made from hominy are superior to grits made from regular cracked corn.  If you like grits, you will love this product from Angelina's Gourmet.  One item missing from Amazon and Angelina is cooking instructions.  Bring 1 1/4 cups of water to a low boil.  Add 1/3 cups of grits. Turn heat to its lowest setting.  You want the grits to barely simmer, not boil!  Stir well and frequently for the first couple of minutes.  Cover pan , removing to stir every couple of minutes.  About 15 minutes will do it.  The longer you can cook without going dry, the creamier the grits will be. Serving size?  It's one serving for me, maybe two for you.  You can figure this out......not rocket science."
1,"Well it's a bag of Grits.  So from the standpoint of was the item as described, yes it was.<br /><br />I bought the item to try to answer the question 'What are Grits'?  Some cookbook authors, and on-line chefs, say grits and cornmeal are the same.  But, other sources say the two are different.  I was searching for natural, slow-cooking grits and couldn't find them locally.  In grocery stores I could only find Instant or Quick-cooking grits and one of the recipes I wanted to try warned me away from those products.<br /><br />I'm glad I bought these even though the 10lb bag is going to last me a long time.  I have enjoyed the cooking process, the versatility and, eating them."
1,10 pounds is quite a bit more than you think it is!  Keep in a dry cool place!<br />Delicious!
1,"these are good because you have to cook them, not like the ones at the store."
1,"I've been a Total junkie for years.  After several successive years of excellent results on my annual physicals, I figure this must be one of the things this old Nam Vet is doing right. However, health food is wasted unless it is combined with regular and strenuous exercise.  Try this for a Total breakfast.  Add two tablespoons of Oregon Blueberries from Amazon.Com and two tablespoons of crushed almonds over your Total.  Sweeten with Splenda. Pour on either skim milk or light soy milk. Add coffee, orange juice and a banana on the side - and then go work out for a half day."
1,"This coffee is closer to what I drank at the kafeneios in Greece than any other Greek or Turkish coffee I've tried. It's absolutely wonderful and very much worth trying if you like Greek or Turkish coffee. My favorite variety so far, I have a cup of it every morning with breakfast. My only complaint is that I can't find larger bags of it!"
0,"After playing sports for many years I thought the ""Lace Cover"" would save me a lot of electrical tape that I normally use to secure boot laces. So when I saw these I thought what a great idea. Well yesterday they were used for the first time and......FAIL. The Lace Cover comes in 1 size only ( too large for most people ). I have a reasonably large foot ( size 13 US )and although the Lace Cover is elasticized , was reasonably loose fitting. Hence , they never really did cover the laces properly. Then after some scrummaging ( Rugby Union ) , one of the lace covers vanished completely. Although the item is not expensive , save your money. It's back to the electrical tape for me !"
1,"I dont take it to lose weight, this is a laxative tea, as all the ones labeled ""weight loss tea"" .I'm very constipated and taking this tea everyday has helped me very much, with no cramps or other negative effects. It's strong and dont recommend it for ocassional constipation or for losing weight. Warning: when it works you ""have"" to go."
0,"Oh my gosh.  I bought this tea and drank my first cup in the late afternoon.  By evening I was having the worst stomach cramps and diarrhea.  I belatedly looked at the ingredients and the first one is senna leaves.  During internet research I discovered that some individuals may experience discomfort or cramping after using senna products.  Also the following admonition - don't take senna for more than a week or so or your body could end up relying on it to contract your bowels.<br /><br />Side effects can include:<br />*diarrhea<br />*intestinal cramps or gripping pains<br />*rash<br />*severe weight loss<br /><br />Senna should not be used by persons with Crone's disease, Diverticular disease and other similar diseases.<br /><br />Senna is not a daily or causal supplement and excessive use can cause liver damage.<br /><br />I wanted to die my insides hurt so bad.  Any weight loss you may accomplish with this tea may not be worth the pain.  Be aware before you use.  I threw my remaining 29 tea bags away!"
1,"This tea really works!  It cleanses you and keeps you regular.  The taste can be overwhelming if you let it brew too long but the benefits are well worth it.  I drink a lot of tea, especially Yogi & all of them deliver on what they are supposed to do."
1,"I often need fast protein & I find this tuna to be the answer; it is delicious, not fishy like Trader Joe's tuna.<br /><br />I looked up the best sustainable canned tuna choices, since I love tuna, and hope to not eat unsustainable food ... a website I like & trust is the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch site; I consult it before buying seafood, and they give Tongol tuna, wild caught off the coast of Malaysia to be a ""good alternative"" - this Natural Sea canned Tongol Tuna is wild caught off the coast of Thailand - so enjoy a safe pleasure!<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Tongol Tuna<br /><br />Most tongol tuna is ranked as ""Avoid"" due to high levels of bycatch and poor enforcement of fisheries regulations.<br /><br />Consumer Note<br />Tongol is typically marketed as either tongol tuna or canned light tuna, and is gaining popularity as a slightly moister alternative to albacore (white) tuna.<br /><br />Summary<br />Unlike most other commercially caught tuna species that travel the world's oceans, tongol tuna is ""neritic,"" meaning it favors nearshore waters. It's found in the Indian and Western Pacific Oceans.<br /><br />Over 90 percent of tongol tuna in the market comes from four nations: Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia and Thailand. All have numerous management measures in place to help protect tongol tuna populations; however, Malaysia is the only one that also has adequate enforcement. For this reason, tongol tuna from Malaysia is ranked as a ""Good Alternative.""<br /><br />Tongol tuna is caught in a variety of ways. Gear such as trolls, handlines, or pole gear is more selective, and tongol tuna caught these ways are ""Good Alternatives.""<br /><br />Tongol tuna caught using all other gear (including gillnets and purse seines) has high bycatch of sharks and juvenile fishes and is ranked as ""Avoid"" - unless caught in Malaysia, in which case it's a ""Good Alternative."""
1,I accidentally stumbled upon these Crunchy Dills in my local market and now cannot find them anywhere local.  These are the best German Dills I have ever eaten.  These are the only pickles I can eat out of the jar--no sandwich needed. I highly recommend them to anyone who adores authentic German pickles.
1,Excellent product.  I ordered the Key Lime.  Though it is extremely concentrated a little goes a long way.  Made a great Key Lime Pie.  Only complaint is the shipping.  The shipping is more than the product itself.  Probably won't order again.
1,"This puree was absolutely delicious!  I used it to make white chocolate raspberry cheesecakes, raspberry vinaigrette, raspberry mousse filling for cake and an accompaniment to flourless chocolate cake and lemon pound cake.  The shipping costs more than the puree.  As much as I love this product I may start making my own rather than spend $50+ for raspberries and sugar."
1,Whether you like the basic fruit smoothie or a gourmet fruit based sauce -- this is a gourmet item in its simplest and finest form.  I have also tried some of the vegetable items as well.  Good too.
1,"I really like this stuff! It's much lighter than the oil soaked variety, if you're watching your calories, the oil baked kind can really ruin your day. These chips are light, crispy, and very low calorie. The flavor is nice, the cayenne and jalapeno makes it nasty hot, just like the packaging says."
1,This is one of my favorite teas. I enjoy the smooth taste and especially being able to taste the  cinnamon.
1,"I've been a chewing gum addict since high school, but have decided to avoid aspartame.  Imagine my dismay when I found that every gum at the grocery store and warehouse store contained it!  Happily, I discovered this gum at a local health food store.  The gum is flavored with natural ingredients (Fruit also contains artificial flavors), has no food coloring, and is sweetened with Xylitol (a natural sweetener with oral health benefits).  The flavors are delicious (I like to chew one Green Tea with one Cinnamon), and Amazon's price is awesome compared to $2 for 10 pieces I paid at the store.<br />The flavors do not last as long as gum that contains aspartame, and I miss having a gum wrapper in which to dispose of my old gum, but I love being able to enjoy gum without worrying about my health!"
1,"Been chewing this gum for years, very good taste on all 5 different ones and as other person said flavor doesn't last long as aspartame gums but it doesn't totally disappear in minutes like some other gums.  i buy at whole foods but soooo expensive so this price on line is much better.  i have 4 kids and we will go through 4 bottles a month easy but it' sbetter than chewing the aspartame crap that everything else has.  the green tea flavor is pretty awesome and so is the fruit."
1,"I purchased Spry at the recommendation of my dentist to assist with dry mouth(not to be confused with cotton mouth :P, but I am sure it could help with that too).  I am not a big gum chewer, but decided I would like this better than the mouth wash, which I have tried.<br /><br />I like all the flavors of this package.  I try to chew on a piece after eating/drinking anything, but usually at least twice a day after a meal. After using Spry, I have noticed a significant improvement from before trying Spry. My teeth and mouth feel cleaner longer than with just regular brushing.  Additionally, dryness isn't nearly as bad as before.<br /><br />At first I thought the price was a bit high, but I don't feel that way anymore. Is cheaper per piece than many popular gums. You don't want to buy this with the impression that it can replace your typical chewing gum.  It wasn't designed to be a long lasting gum.  However, I haven't had any problems chewing on a piece of Spry for up to 20 minutes(direction say to chew for 5 minutes) and it didn't start to break down or taste bad.<br /><br />I recommend this product."
1,"I am a big time snacker. So, instead of consuming all those calories when I snack, I often opt for chewing gum just to keep my mouth moving. I have purchased this product at the local health food store but was turned off buying it because of the high price. But I love it, it tastes good and is a guilt-free chewing gum without all the garbage in regular gum. I especially like that it helps prevent tooth decay in between meals. Sure, the taste doesn't last as long as regular gum, hence the need for buying it in bulk.<br /><br />I am so glad I could purchase it online for a good price. So worth it."
1,I like this gum. Since I have been using it I have had no cavaties.
1,"I first tried this gum from my local health food market.  I have been ordering it now from amazon in bulk.  Just received 5 large jars of various flavors and I enjoy them all.  It is supposed to be a healthier way to chew gum compared to aspertame, etc.  Will continue to order this gum from amazon."
1,"It was recommended by a dentist on a ""Doctors"" show. I could not find it in a drug stores. Thank you Amazon!!!!"
1,"I felt that I might have a problem with things containing Aspartame, so I decided to look for a gum that didn't have it. This gum is aspartame free, and so far hasn't caused any adverse effects. Gum with aspartame would give me a headache (and no, not from the chewing). I also switched diet sodas, and now only drink Diet Rite or Diet Coke with splenda. I never realized that my little headaches were cause by anything. I guess I thought the chewing of the gum and the caffeine from the sodas caused them, plus they weren't terrible headaches. But now I am headache free! Such an easy little change improved my quality of life. I would recommend this gum to anyone! It tastes really good, and all my friends that have tried it, like it. The only downside is it can get tough, but I don't mind. I only chew it to freshen my breath. I don't think it's a good gum for exercise."
1,"True the flavor doesn't last for a long time, but it tastes great and lasts long enough!"
1,The flavors are pretty good. I thought I would hate the Green Tea one but it is actually nice. Sort of minty. I would definitely buy it again.<br /> A great product that is well worth the money. Especially considering that it cuts down on cavities (by giving you something sweet to chew on without the sugar or fake sweetener).<br /> Some say that the flavor doesn't last long but I haven't experienced that problem. It does fade but maybe my taste buds are extra sensitive to pick up the flavor longer.
0,"We share gum at work between 5 of us, so I decided to get creative and purchase the Spry five flavor pack. Big mistake...it had great flavor for about one minute, it looses it's flavor and is hard to chew. We are addicted to chewing gum and will continue our search for the best gum with xylitol. We will not purchase this gum again and do not recommend it to you!"
1,My Daughter has an enamel defect on her teeth and the dentist recommended this xylitol gum for her.  The flavor does not last long.  But it is suppose to help with decay etc. so having her chew some when we can't brush or instead of sugary gum is a good option.  Price was great on Amazon vs. my local health food store.
1,"I have purchased this twice, love the gum and it's far better than any on the market taste and health wise."
1,"Healthy chewing with loads of benefits including preventitive tooth decay that is not found in others. I suggest giving the Spry ' 5 Flavors ' Gum Pack a whirl. The taste is delicious, not at all weird with texture, and you and/or children will never know it is a healthier version of chewing gum. The scents are terrific and flavor lasts about as long as traditional (unhealthy) gums. There are PLENTY of pieces packed into each large container so you can chew to your hearts content."
1,These mini-bags are great if you're watching your weight - each bag contains 3 cups of low-fat popcorn - counts as 1 Weight Watcher point.  Great for an afternoon or evening snack.  Watch it closely while popping because it will burn easily.
1,"Price for this beats the grocery store easily.  Haven't figured out how to get the best popping out of this stuff though-- I always end up with a surprising number of unpopped kernels, even on different microwaves."
1,"If you're on a diet or just trying in search for the best guilt-free snack you can find, I heartily recommend Act II Popcorn, 100 Calorie Butter Mini-Bags. The portion control is perfect. You actually can munch on three cups of popcorn in one single serving bag, and it's only 100 calories with a luscious buttery taste.<br /><br />All you need is a diet soda or an iced tea and you can really fill up, taking the edge off your appetite until meal time. This is an excellent product, very convenient to prepare."
1,if you have children. Everyone gets there own bag and there is no hassel. Kettle corn is the best flavor.
1,"Act II Popcprn is the best tasting popcorn around in my opinion.  I've been eating this brand for over 20 years.  Now that the kids and husband are gone, I love the convenience of these small 100 calorie bags.  My local grocery stores have discontinued this product.  Thanks Amazon for making this superb snack available."
0,I got these as a snack item and we happened to have them when one of my family members was craving popcorn one night. We all decided that this tasted like buttered styrofoam but maybe we were expecting too much.
0,"The amount of popcorn per bag surprised me, as it is quite a lot! That was the one positive thing about this item. The flavouring is not so good. This is very dry popcorn, which I might have expected had I bought a light butter or a natural version. Tastes like cardboard. I will not be buying this again. How am I going to get though all my boxes? Pour a little melted butter on it. And a touch of salt. Not what you'd want to have to do with a microwave butter version, but there it is."
1,"I bought this item, because it was the pefrect individual servings for everyone. Just right. I recommend this itemnot only because of size, but the fact that it is just 100 calories, and tastes great."
1,"Ordered this for my daughter to take to college. It's microwave popcorn, what more can you say? She's happy with it so I'm happy with it."
0,Jolly Time is a much better brand and also has the 100 calorie bags but there's much too much waste (un popped kernels) with Act II.
0,"I bought this because it was mini bags of ACT II popcorn ,which in the past the larger bags where very tasty and tasted fresh.<br />These small bags however have a funny taste and taste old ( and the date on them is good for a long time) These are not a good fresh crunchy popcorn taste.All the kernels don't pop and if you do get them to then the bag burns.I won't buy this kind again.I stick with pop secret."
1,"Mate is actually not tea but a tea-like beverage originating from Argentina and Uruguay, and primarily consumed in those countries as well as in Paraguay and southern Brazil; brewed from the dried leaves and stemlets of the perennial Yerba Mate tree. Its name derives from the quichua word ""mati"" designating the gourd in which it is traditionally served. On average, 300,000 tons of Mate are produced each year.<br /><br />In its consistency similar to green tea, mate has a distinctive, full, bittersweet flavor with a note of alfalfa, resembling that of tea but milder. Of the 196 volatile chemical compounds contained in Yerba Mate, 144 are also contained in tea. Knowing its manifold health benefits - among the plant's ingredients are the alkaloids xanthine, theophylline and theobromine as well as vitamins C, E, several B vitamins and numerous minerals - the South American Guarani Indians have traditionally used the plant for medicinal purposes, inter alia as a stimulant to the central nervous system, to promote mental, physical and cardiovascular activity, enhance resistance to fatigue, reduce fever, mitigate thirst and hunger, decrease blood pressure, and as a diuretic, laxative, purgative, sudorific, and antirheumatic.<br /><br />Legend has it that knowledge of the infusion's powers was first imparted to a young Guarani woman and her father by a mysterious shaman, rewarding the woman's faithfulness in staying with her exhausted father while her tribe continued their search for arable land. In recent years, mate has become a cultural phenomenon throughout large parts of South America, and it is now gaining increased popularity in Northern America and Europe as well. In South America, sharing mate from the same container and the same straw (bombilla) is a symbol of closeness and friendship, both in a family and in other social contexts."
1,"I'm spoiled with biscotti. We have a great local company that makes lots of flavors and it's my favorite biscotti. That said, this is hands down the best nationally distributed biscotti I've had.<br />The chocolate is a nice thick coat and the biscotti itself is not too sweet. Just sweet enough to make a nice treat. The individually wrapped packages keep it crisp without letting it get too hard.<br /><br />Biscotti is twice baked, the second baking gives it the right amount of hardness and people like different amounts of hard. I want a cookie that I can bite into without soaking it for several minutes in coffee by that will also hold up to being dunked. If you are used to very hard biscotti, this may be too soft for your tastes.<br /><br />Nice size, doesn't fall apart in coffee, good amount of chocolate and individually wrapped. These are a good option for people who want a treat on the go with a cup of coffee."
1,"I ordered this product hoping it would arrive in a decent time because I am deployed to Kuwait. I had no issues with shipping and the product arived quickly. Nonni's is one of my favorite cookies, so I really am happy that I can enjoy them here."
1,I really enjoyed the flavor and texture.  The only compliant is the packaging or method of shipping.  Many were broken.  Highly recommend
1,"They come well packaged for shipping, and because they are individually wrapped they don't break and stay fresh for a long time.  The Cioccolati are my favorite for their delicate almondy taste and the rich dark chocolate coating.<br /><br />I've tried a LOT of biscotti from different places like Whole Foods, coffee houses, bakeries, and more.  This is by far the best, especially for dunking in coffee.  Unlike all other biscotti, I never have a problem with these rather large biscotti falling apart.  I can dunk and wait for the last drops to fall before taking a bite and I don't get the end of it falling off and plunking into my coffee to become a sodden mess.  And the coating becomes a delicious liquid chocolate.<br /><br />Compare these to the vanilla and almond biscotti at Starbucks, which always taste like they're weeks old despite being individually wrapped.  Nonni's does it right!"
1,"What a morning treat!  The best way to eat these is to dunk them in coffee.  Nonni is the Italian word for Grandmother.  These biscoti's are made just like in Italy.  They are twice baked to make them extra crunchy.  We like the plain, the cioccolati, and the carmel pecan ones."
1,"Eating a Nonni's Cioccolati Biscotti makes me feel as if I'm in a TV commercial. They are crunchy, tasty and best of all dark chocolaty; and, you don't feel like your teeth are going to break because they are tender at the same time having that delightful crunch.  Did I mention they are about twice the size of a regular biscotti?  Now my only problem is whether or not I can eat them all before they become stale!  Oh, yeh, that's why I buy that expensive Tassimo coffee!"
0,They sent this to me and I never ordered it cause I don't like dark chocolate at all.Trying to send it back to who sent it.
0,These are very colorful but not the best tasting. I used them for my sons first bday as we were having a very large party and didn't want to buy 20 mini cans but taste wise the quality was not there....the look was great. I'm sure no one knew any better after all frosting fixes all.
1,The Jimmies had purple in the mix.  That was exactly what I was looking for.  Since we are not planning on eating these (but throwing them instead of rice). I won't know taste.  But color is excellent!
1,"I used these rainbow jimmies for a rainbow cupcake topper and added them to rice krispie treats for my daughter's 6th birthday.  Obviously, it was a rainbow party.  The package didn't look like the picture, but I was not disappointed in the product.  I would buy from this company again."
1,"We chose a Thing 1/Thing 2 theme for our twins' first birthday party, and these sprinkles were the perfect color. They lean more towards turquoise than a true blue, but with our red baking cups, and white frosting, they were the perfect finishing touch!"
1,These sprinkles make a great presentation and are tasty too!  Used them for my french chocolate balls.  Would recommend them highly.
1,"Exactly what I thought it would be. ALOT (more then I will ever need) of pink sprinkles, that taste like... sprinkles!"
1,"Great size bag for the price! I am making a funfetti cake with just purple. These sprnkles/jimmies are exactly what I wanted. Although, the color could be darker."
1,Jimmies sprinkles are the best i love them because they are soft and unlike the other hard sprinkles don't get stuck in your teeth. lol But it was a great buy. You have a better deal here that anywhere else.
1,"Good quality sprinkles.  Pricing seems pretty decent.  Love the way they make my cupcakes look - takes me back to my elementary school days, long ago!  Only gripes: the ""partially-hydrogenated"" ingredient and non-resealable bag.  By the way, the advertised bag looks completely different than the one you get - it's not black.  Tastes like classic Jimmies too and isn't so sweet that it'll over-sweeten your frosting."
1,"This was perfect for my purposes! I made a personalized ""funfetti"" cake for a bridal shower for a girl whose colors were hot pink and black, and this was awesome to get it done! Fast shipping too!"
1,I bought these sprinkles for my cupcakes and not only are they gorgeous but you get a lot for the money. The silver is very true to color and they make a lovely accent to your cupcakes.
1,"I bought these jimmies because I couldn't find the needed orange color in any of my local stores.  A pound of jimmies is a lot, but I went through more than I expected, probably half the bag to thoroughly coat a recipe of chocolate truffles.  The taste is, well, jimmy-taste.  My only disappointment/surprise was how short these jimmies are -- about two-thirds of the length of Wilton and CakeMate brands I have in the cupboard.<br /><br />If you need a special color that only CK makes, don't hesitate to get them.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee  Wesselmann"
1,"Seriously, sprinkles are not just for eye pleasing aesthetics but for mouth pleasing texture.  This bag is great value compared to buying the smaller size shakers with different colors. I can use two of containers of  those colors on one batch of 24 cupcakes.  I just have to find a proper container to put the bag ones in so they are easy to shake out onto cupcakes, as that is what I use them for mostly. I'll check on amazon to see if I can find an appropriate shaker.  I may just buy a smaller one (about 10 oz) shaker and use and re-use that one.  My son and I like them also on ice cream, topped with ready whip canned cream. Gives pleasing texture to  ice cream. Yum!"
0,How can I possibly order this to review it if I have no information?  Four jars of mixed spices?  What kinds of mix?  Leftovers?  Four pigs in a poke?  What in the world are you offering?
1,"I'm very pleased with the tea. It smells and tastes organic and pure.<br /><br />The only problem I have is with the packaging. When I received the product the box was banged up and appeared to be old. But what bothered me was that the tea bags themselves looked old and flimsy. The tea bags are individually wrapped but when you unwrap them they almost fall apart. The bag material is really thin and frail and it barely holds its content inside. The bag only broke in two or three instances out of fifty but I had to be careful with them. Other than that, I loved drinking this tea."
1,"20 tea bags dropped in one gallon of 100% Pure Aloe Vera Natural Juice with every meal, snacks also ( do not cheat! tastes bitter but works) helps with those hard to lose extra pounds, I saw results after two weeks."
1,"I was recently in Peru and switched from coffee to coca tea for it's alleged attributes in dealing with altitude sickness etc.  The product I purchased is what I expected.  However, the time of expected delivery  was about a week & a half longer then the time stated."
1,"All I can say is that I love this stuff. I use two bags along with one bag of Green Tea in the morning with breakfast and it provides me with loads of energy.<br /><br />Warning, If I drink it after 1:00 PM it keeps me awake most of the night so use care if you want to get any sleep and use it at breakfast.<br /><br />Thought I should mention that when I placed my order it was only for a box of coca tea. The description has changed since I placed my order."
1,"Great shipping -- 3 days earlier than expected! Careful packaging too!<br /><br />The product -- it tasted great and fresh. The aroma was fragrant, and when I drank the tea, I did feel invigorated with a loss of appetite. Works like a charm for those horrible 3am problem sets!"
1,I don't know how I functioned before I found this magical stuff....it's like being up 4 to nothing in the second inning......everyday.....sometimes I still loose the game....but up 4 nothing in the second inning...i like my odds :)
0,The shipping was fast and the customer service was excellent. I was just very disappointed in the product itself. The product claims to give energy and reduce appetite yet after drinking the tea I never experienced a decrease in appetite or any energy. Wouldn't buy it again.
1,"Excellent Product at an excellent price.. Will be ordering more in the future. Chocolate & Peanuts, it doesn't get any better than this..."
0,"Look elsewhere for a better DEAL on Amazon by buying bulk than this ripoff OVERPRICED item.<br />Besides, these contain stems/partial stems, which not only cheapens the price but wounds up with uneven done-ness. If you want best quality, your best bet would be to look for stem-free (caps only) variety even though they tend to cost more. From one gourmet chef to another, hope it helps."
1,"This is the BEST spice for grilling and even salads!  Love it!  HATE that once it's used up, we probably won't be able to get it again.  Gotta wonder WHY??"
1,"It always seems that when you find something you really like it soon will disappear off the market.  I bought this at Costco first and used it on grilled meats.  After the grilling season it was not carried anymore.  Then the next year it did not come back Weber had other spices but not the Six Pepper Fusion variety.  I searched the web but all sites where it was listed were sold out. I continued to search periodically until recently the item appeared on Amazon.  There were only three (3), left in packs of three (3).  So I ordered two (2), leaving one.  I am enjoying grilling with it again.  I guess I will have to reverse engineer the product and make it myself before I run out again."
1,"We bought a bottle of this at a local store out of curiosity, and loved it.  We use it on everything. I can not stand plain old black pepper anymore--the blend of peppers in this is wonderful.  You grind it fresh--the bottle IS the grinder.  Excellent on burgers and steaks before you grill them, too.  Sadly, we have not been able to locate this in any stores and our bottle is almost empty."
1,"While traveling in Nepal, I was introduced to full-cream powdered milk. Not only was it great tasting, but was a safer alternative to local supply. Since returning to the United States, it has been IMPOSSIBLE to find! Yes, plenty of the poor tasting low-fat varieties are in every supermarket - but no full cream anywhere!<br /><br />Some months ago, PEAK Dry Whole Milk became available through internet suppliers. Four cans were ordered and enjoyed. The milk has the fine full taste of European dairy products.<br /><br />BEST USE: put powder directly in tea or coffee. Makes your morning brew rich and creamy!<br /><br />Hope Amazon will also offer the smaller cans which are more convenient for travel."
1,"Powder mixes easily when shaken; I found adding more than the recommended 3 tablespoons per 8 ounce of water gave milk a ""milkier"" taste and helped disguise the dry powder milk flavor you often find in dry milk products.  Best powdered milk I've ever drunk.  When more powder is added to water than recommended on the label (maybe twice as much), and milk is allowed to chill, reconstituted milk tastes very similar to fresh milk, with minimal dry powder milk after-taste.  Highly recommend.  Though wish it were less expensive, would buy again. In disaster preparation and long term food storage, it's nice to have foods/beverages you actually enjoy eating/drinking, rather than just any old thing."
1,"This is, by far, the best whole milk powder on the market. Even immediately after reconstitution it has a fresh, creamy taste and when chilled, is better than many ""fresh"" milks on the market. It is a bit pricy as milk goes, but no more so than any dried non-fat milk in the market. excellent for when fresh milk is unavailable or for lack of refrigeration. Highly reccommended!"
1,"For years, I have missed out on a high quality, digestable, nourishing product.  Drinking whole milk has caused me indigestion, among other things, gas, and weight. My first glass of this milk acted like a probiotic. Milk I had as a child which I had gotten away from.  My food settled down where it supposed to go after my first glass of this milk.  I was so happy with this powdered milk that I would recommend it to anyone. Throw out the lactose milk and get good quality milk. True, it is expensive, but it is worth the cost.  The feeling of not being bloated, not drinking milk with additives and preservatives, knowing that it is nutritious, that the milk comes from the best dairy country, thrills me greatly. I have wasted too many years in getting the best product from Amazon.  This product has my highest recommendations."
1,"I bought Peak whole dried milk a few months ago, and it is yummy and wonderful! While I am lactose intolerant, I take a digestive capsule with lactase and other digestive aids (getting older!) and it seems to work. I use it for my gluten-free oatmeal that only takes a minute of boiling water, add a spoon or two of this, and I am in heaven for a while! Fresh blueberries and again, a heaping spoon of this, a bit of lactose-free milk for liquid, a little sugar- and back into heaven again. I can't tell you how WONDERFUL it tastes after years of  2% milk on everything!"
1,"Frankly, I don't care if food is organic, or non-organic, or natural, or whatever. I like food that tastes good. And while I recognize that cookies aren't really ""food"", in the sense that they're a desert -- and certainly not something you turn to if you're looking for your basic nutrition, I find these particular cookies to be totally AWESOME. I like my oatmeal raisin cookies soft, and that's what these are. Soft, sweet, chewy, superb. I wouldn't mind if they were a smidgeon cheaper, but I would imagine making them organic adds to the cost -- so I blame you danged hippies with your granola-crunchy desire for kumbaya soul harmony when it comes to the sticker shock. Still, they're good enough they're worth it. They'll probably negatively impact my waistline, but as I'm not a believer in reincarnation, I figure I got one shot at existence. May as well take the time to stop and gorge on the cookies.<br /><br />The delicious, delicious cookies."
1,"If you want a cookie that has that homemade, old-fashioned taste, Country Choice organic oatmeal raisin cookies will fit the bill.  They are rather pricey, but you do get what you pay for.  These cookies are individually wrapped and that makes it handy to put them in a lunchbox, backpack, or any portable bag.  They are quite soft so you can't expect them to be in one piece if you pack them with solid items like an apple.<br /><br />These cookies are small at just under 3"" in diameter, so don't expect you are getting a box of giant sized cookies.  They are great for people who are trying to watch what they eat or are perfect for small hands.  I'll list the ingredients below for people who have special dietary needs or allergies.  All the nutritional facts for this product are on the company website.<br /><br />NOTE:  These cookies do contain egg, soy and coconut ingredients and are ""Manufactured on shared equipment with milk, wheat, peanut and other tree nut containing products.""<br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />Organic Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Organic Sugar, Organic Raisins, Organic Cane Syrup, Water, Organic Whole Grain Oat Flour, Organic High Oleic Sunflower and/or Safflower Oil, Organic Brown Rice Flour, Organic Honey, Organic Coconut, Organic Whole Eggs, Leavening (Baking Soda, Monocalcium Phosphate), Corn Starch, Sea Salt, Organic Vanilla Extract, Soy Lecithin, Guar Gum, Organic Cinnamon"
1,"A cookie a day (or 2, depending on serving size) is one of my few indulgences. I discovered the Country Choice line at my local Wegman's originally. Their prices are good, but I think Amazon has them beat for the Oatmeal Raisin cookies.<br /><br />These cookies are individually wrapped. One cookie is a serving, at about 100 cals.<br /><br />I like that the cookie is soft, and the raisins are soft and still moist.<br /><br />I really like that the ingredients are organic.<br /><br />They're good tasting to me, not too sweet, not too anything. Just right.<br /><br />Along with their Vanilla Wafers, and Trader Joes' Almond Windmill cookies (and lately, their Southern Style Pecan cookies), these are definitely in my Top 5 Cookie list.<br /><br />Give them a try by buying a single box locally ... then come back and get the mega pack from Amazon."
1,"These cookies are fantastic! They're not too sweet, and not loaded with chocolate like other products. Tons of chocolate in a cookie doesn't necessarily mean that it'll taste better. I like soft cookies, and these have a nice texture and don't fall apart when I bite into them."
1,"These cookies are delicious.  Not too sweet, and the perfect size for a quick, guilt-free snack.  Convenient to pack in lunches or as a snack at work.  Plus, no ingredients that I can't pronounce.  This is a great, tasty choice when looking for an organic treat.  And the price is a great deal on Amazon!"
1,"These are the best organic oatmeal cookies I've been able to find.  I've been getting Mrs. Denson's for years, but they have raisins, without which I can do, and they're very good when they're not too crisp.  But I just saw these at Amazon, and decided to take a chance and give them a try.  I'm delighted with them.  They really are soft, not crunchy, they don't have any raisins, and they're packaged in individual sealed packets.  I've got a new standard cookie!"
1,"These are soft, individually-wrapped and have only 100 calories!  Great taste, soft, and no transfat!  Great meal replacement.  You've got to try it!"
0,"I actually feel awful giving a bad review to a product manufactured by a company that might be a small, independent operation, but... dang, these are bad.  I checked the label before purchasing them b/c while I am all for the idea of organic, I did not want some crazy gluten-free, vegan, tasteless, saw dust biscuit.  These were neither gluten-free nor vegan, passing the test with real ingredients like whole eggs, flour and real chocolate.  I figured I was in for a treat.  WRONG.  Unfortunately, they are dry (even though they're ""soft baked""), and flavorless.  They have that very specific, cardboard, non-flavor that you get with weirdo hippie-food.  (Nothing against weirdo hippies - they're great - it's just that sometimes their packaged food sucks.)<br /><br />Bottom line... if I'm going to indulge, I'd rather eat crappy cookies filed with unpronounceable sludge from some evil multinational.  Truth is, sometimes hydrogenated & high-fructose tastes better.<br /><br />P.S.  Despite the large photo on the large box, the cookies are quite small.  About 30% smaller than pictured.  Not cool."
1,"I really like this cookie. First of all, there is nothing in the cookie that I don't feel comfortable eating. The majority of the ingredients are organic. The taste is sweet, but not overly done. I have the oatmeal chocolate chip and it really fits the bill as a good snack. At 100 calories - its just right.<br />Now, this isn't a meal replacement - it is kind of small so it won't fill you up. But the taste is really good and you can feel good eating it.  Not as sweet as many oatmeal cookies that you find, but you can definitely taste oatmeal and chocolate! I have these on SS. I think they are a good deal for the quality of the ingredients.<br /><br />Ingredient list:<br />Organic whole rolled oats, organic sugar, organic dark chocolate chips, water, organic high oleic sunflower oil, organic honey, organic brown rice flour, organic whole eggs, leavening, organic corn starch, sea salt, organic vanilla extract, guar gum, soy lecithin, organic cinnamon.<br /><br />100 calories<br />4 g fat<br />15 g carbohydrate<br />1 g fiber<br />8 g sugar<br />1 g protein"
0,The cookies taste like the cake snack called Devil Dogs.  They're very dry.  It's probably what chocolate dirt sprinkled with chocolate chips would taste like.  If you like Devil Dogs then you'll probably like these cookies.
1,"In my opinion, these chocolate chip cookies are, by far, the best-tasting cookies I've ever eaten!  They're the only cookies I buy. I really like the soft texture of the cookies, the oatmeal flavor, and the melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness of the plentiful chocolate chips.  In addition, they're made with organic products and they are relatively low in calories (100 for a 23 gram cookie) and saturated fats (only 1 gram per cookie).  My suggestion is to try just one and see if you can resist having another  { : > )"
1,"This cookie is somewhat smaller than other individually wrapped cookies.  It is a soft cookie, somewhat more crumbly and a little less chewy than some others.  Like other individually wrapped cookies, it is convenient for a lunch bag, shoulder bag, backpack, or just to keep in your desk drawer.  It comes in various varieties, and I have only tried the oatmeal/chocolate chip."
1,"These cookies have just the right amount of sweetness and a lovely chewy texture. The cinnamon balances out the added sugar and the sweetness from the chocolate chips. It's great that these contain chocolate chips and not the usual raisins because it's unexpected, and it's a bonus for chocoholics looking for something more."
1,"Country Choice Organic Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies were recently named one of the Best 125 Packaged Foods for women by Women's Health magazine.  The editors were won over by the chewy homemade taste, organic ingredients and portion control wrapper.  The cookies are also made with no wheat ingredients.  Available wherever organic food is sold."
0,"This salt is NOT smoked. Read that again. It is a 2 pound bag of white salt that has a fake hickory smell. It is small crystals, about the size of table salt crystals. My guess is that they tried to infuse flavor into the salt rather than smoking it. The hickory flavor is very faint, and very fake tasting. You are much better off buying real smoked salt, such as Gourmet Hickory Smoked Sea Salt by The Spice Lab Inc. I am not in any way affiliated with The Spice Lab - I bought their salt simultaneously with Faerie's Finest in order to compare the two. Not only is it inferior to The Spice Lab, but Faerie's Finest is the worst smoked salt I have tasted."
1,"This has no unnatural additives and is organic. The other reviewer may have been looking for something more traditional in chocolate.  If you're looking for something like hershey's, this won't taste like that. This is much more natural in form, flavor, etc.<br /><br />And part of the proceeds go to help protect animals!"
0,First let me say I am a huge fan of endangered species chocolate.  This is my first time however trying this particular mixture.  I love orange and chocolate as a combination but this one definitely falls short.  Unfortunately from what I can gather and the type of bitterness it is I am guessing they add too much of the pith while creating the orange oil.  It has a smooth delightful start but the more you eat the more pronounced the bitter taste becomes.  I am disappointed by the purchase and will not order this type again.
1,"My local health food store has these for $6.89 a bottle... $6.89 x 6 is $41.34, cheaper than the $45.84 directly from the manufacturer, and that isn't even counting the insane $25 shipping cost.<br /><br />Now of course, my local health food store probably isn't anywhere near you, but my point is, ordering this product online seems quite pointless, especially factoring in the shipping, unless you live in the middle nowhere. Considering this is direct from the manufacturer themselves, you'd think the price would be something reasonable.<br /><br />As for the juice, it's quite delicious, and I try to have several glasses a week."
1,"I like the Crystal Geyser 18 ounce water. This is a refreshing water to drink by itself, or mixed with fruit juice. The 18 ounce bottles are perfect to take with you on the go. Crystal Geyser Sparkling water is great to drink if you are trying to cut out soda. It has the fizz you are used to, but no calories. That makes it perfect to mix with juice."
1,"Born in Italy - my parents drank this often after dinner. I do not like black licorice, but like this drink. It's smooth and does burn a bit going down but gives your belly a nice warm feeling after the first, second, etc. Haha. A great (and Italian) way to drink it is to get coffee beans and put 1-2 in with the shot, light it on fire, blow it out (essential part here! LOL) then drink the shot and chew the coffee beans. It tames the liquor flavor and puts a bit of coffee flavor into the drink and your mouth. Have had Romana Sambucca as well but this is our family's favorite!"
1,"I really appreciate Thai Pavilion's quality. especially when it comes to their sauces. their sauces are just not a watery paste they have real vegetables in them. open up any other thai product and just look at the sauces, I think you'll see literally that Thai Pavilion is much higher quality. taste them smell them. I think you agree with me Thai Pavilion is head and shoulders above the competition. I found this to be true with all their flavors."
0,"The noodles have to be cooked for 10 minutes, and the sauce must have sauteed meat added (according to the package) and would be improved with the addition of some vegetation (according to me).  Therefore this item is neither quick nor complete.  If the sauce was REALLY great, that might make it worthwhile- but it isn't, its just OK."
0,These are just like any other noodles... the only difference is that it takes twice as much to cook.  The sauce that comes with it is EXTREMELY HORRIBLE.  It tastes so bad that I had to use my own spaghetti sauce.<br /><br />1.  Would I eat the rest I have left?  Only if I'm really hungry.<br /><br />2.  Would I buy it again? No<br /><br />3.  Would I recommend it? No
1,"This is my favorite flavor of all (peach, desert pear and raspberry) the syrups I use for my unsweetened teas.  Great stuff and really tastes yummy!"
1,"Being diabetic, I am always on the watch for sugar free snacks. The ""GoLightly Hard Candy"" is a great addition to my snaking list.<br /><br />At only 45 calories and 0 Net Carbs for 4 pieces, these do not impact my blood sugar levels or ruin my diet. These are sweetened with Splenda, so they are slightly less sweet than regular candies, but do not cause the ""laxative"" effect other dietetic candies can have.<br /><br />There are serveral types of available and they are all good!<br /><br />Highly recommended!"
1,"After reading the 1st review, I was scared, but finally thought, will return if it is outdated (cause this is my 2nd order for same product except it was by general mills). Amazon does not disappointed me. Exp.date is May 2012 ! Happy & suggest to purchase if you have more than one member in your family to finish it (I have two kids & they loved the new Wild berry flavour)."
0,"In December, I bought the 14 box case of Trix for a Christmas present.  The receiver was appauled that all 14 boxes had expired 3 months prior!  Buyer beware of shopping for food items at this site!"
0,Can get it  same or lower price elsewhere...Don't see the point of ordering. Like this then. The other comments solidify this idea.
1,"Less expensive than anywhere in town, plus at my local store, you have to special order these smaller cans. Always fresh and well within expiration dates."
1,"I wish my feral queen with CRF would eat this stuff.  She's so not a fan of her special renal diet foods that I try to give her commercial brands (the ones she can keep down) from time to time just to liven things up for her.  Senior foods are best, because they tend to have lower phosphorus and less protein, with the protein included being of higher quality.  This is great quality food, but it seems to be not very palatable.  Mary-Kate's very finicky these days.  I guess if I had to risk tasting everything twice I would be, too.  But her son, Fluffypants, is usually willing to clean up even the least tasty treats we give his mom.  Not this stuff, though. e stuck his nose in the air and walked away."
0,"After playing sports for many years I thought the ""Lace Cover"" would save me a lot of electrical tape that I normally use to secure boot laces. So when I saw these I thought what a great idea. Well yesterday they were used for the first time and......FAIL. The Lace Cover comes in 1 size only ( too large for most people ). I have a reasonably large foot ( size 13 US )and although the Lace Cover is elasticized , was reasonably loose fitting. Hence , they never really did cover the laces properly. Then after some scrummaging ( Rugby Union ) , one of the lace covers vanished completely. Although the item is not expensive , save your money. It's back to the electrical tape for me !"
1,"Lakewood's ORGANIC 100% PURE Pomegranate Juice is expensive compared to Wild Oats's brand, but it's organic (Wild Oats' is not), and pure pomegranate. The flavor is outstanding, and it come in glass bottles, a definite plus over plastic. Shipping was reasonably fast and the packing was also outstanding. My only complaint: I wish shipping would fall under Amazon Prime, but alas it does not. To me, Lakewood's Organic Pure Pomegranate Juice is the best choice in the pomegranate juice market."
1,"I was interest in this particular brand of juice because it is not from concentrate and I know won't being getting filtered tap water with frozen bits of fruit. Also because it's organic, I know I won't be drinking unneeded chemicals to prolong shelf life. I'm fairly certain all drinks (at least juices) need to be pasteurized if bottled. This is the next best thing to pressing the pomegranate juice in your own home. The taste was delicious and I still drank in the antioxidants and nutrients found in pomegranate. Because I do not have the time or instruments to press the pomegranate myself, this is convenient for me to just pour and go. Although it is a little pricey, I figure my well being is worth it."
1,Lakewood pure 100% Pomegranate Juice is $9.99 at Whole Foods. Excellent Product  . Amazon should be more competitive on  the Price
0,"I buy this stuff every week at Publix.  I have seen a ton of health benefits and the high potassium helps keep the water weight down.  Also, it is delicious to drink, especially the type with blueberries mixed in.<br /><br />Having said that, I pay $5.15 for a 32 ounce bottle.  $5.15.  Yes, and with sales tax, I'm sure it's closer to $5.75.  Come on, Amazon.  This is a friggin' rip off."
0,One can buy the same 32 oz Bottle from grocery store for $9.99 thus making a 6 bottle purchase to $59.64 even after paying sales tax it will be much less than $75.36 +shipping. I dont know why would someone buy it from Amazon.
0,I was getting the Langers fresh pressed pomegranate juice at Rayley's(they recently stop carrying it) for a little over 5 bucks this is 16.67 per bottle...please
0,This product description does not say whether this product is pasteurized. Alton Brown on Good Eats says that if pomegranate juice is pasteurized you lose a lot of the antioxidant benefits. I would likely change to more stars if it is not pasteurized.
1,"If you are reading this you probably know about <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5ZHO"">Huy Fong, Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a>, which is a great condiment and a must-have at my table. Huy Fong also makes Chili Garlic sauce (i.e. the one on this product page) which is a better sauce to cook with. The blend of Chili & Garlic is a wonderful flavor combination for stir-fries etc. You can also use it as a condiment, although it is not as fine and blended as a condiment sauce. While Sriracha is a great condiment I find that it's not that great for cooking use - the flavor seems to change due to heat. The Chili Garlic sauce is much better for cooking use.<br />I hope you find this helpful!"
1,This is by far the best thing ever!! It taste fantastic and goes well with everything. I found myself making excuses to eat it on everything I possibly could. Personally I find it to be the most addictive thing I ever tasted. The smell alone is reason enough to buy it.
1,"Received this about a week ago and I have already used it in tacos, black beans and rice, salsa and Chinese stir fried chicken and vegetables. The primary ingredients are chili, salt, garlic and distilled vinegar. It does contain preservatives, namely potassium sulfate and sodium bisulfite so if you are allergic to sulfites you might want to avoid this sauce. Be forewarned that it is very potent so a little goes a long way. As with any spice, just add a little at a time until you reach the amount of heat that is right for you. I can't wait to mix a bit in with my pizza sauce. It is a five star sauce but I deducted a star because I think it is rather pricey."
1,"This is a similiar product to one we used to purchase years ago at a speciality shop here in Florida.  We were both thrilled to find it.  It is a great spice for almost anything.  Spicy, but used sparingly, not hot."
1,"This will not ""burn out"" your mouth. It is spicy with a great flavor. They need to make this in a larger jar!"
1,"I purchased this at my local grocery store.  I have had the Sriracha hot sauce(Rooster sauce) and like so I thought I would see how this was.  It tastes similar to Sriracha sauce BUT HAS MUCH MORE FLAVOR AND MUCH MORE VERSATILITY.  Don't hesitate to order this, except you should get the larger size.  The 8 oz size only lasted two weeks.  It's now my newest favorite sauce."
1,"The first time I tried this sauce was at a Chinese restaurant. It has the right amount of spice to wake up the tastebuds and kick the flavor,of a dish, up a notch. If you enjoy spicy food, give this a try. I love it!"
1,"If you like Asian food, and you like it HOT, this is just the ticket for you.<br />Also good in curries and cajun dishes.<br /><br />Use it to stir fry shrimp, chicken, or beef, or just use it like you would any<br />condiment like salsa or Tabasco sauce. Amazing flavor, and trust me, this stuff<br />is hot. About a 7 on a scale of 10. Tremendous garlic and hot chili flavor, will<br />make you discover cooking all over again! This will perk up any Chinese takeout,<br />and its even good in Hot n' Sour Soup! Its very thick, almost like a paste so a<br />little bit goes a long way. Sells locally here for around $3. 5 Pods"
1,"In the infamous words of Sir Glenn Quagmire; ""Yes, yes, yes...""  This is really the best hot sauce I've ever tasted.  And although I've only ordered it from Very Asian, they were johnny on the spot with my order."
1,This is a Must Buy! its very great tasting and its very hot! I recommend this!
1,I love this stuff!  It is extremely hot and a little bit goes a long way.  My favorite uses are in stir-fries and on burgers.  I suppose it would be good on pizza too.  The uses are endless!
1,"If you want to add a kick to you food try this product.  It's delicious.<br />Be carful though, a little goes a long way!"
1,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006SKCVI"">Huey Fong Chili Garlic Sauce 8 Oz</a> This sauce made of crushed red peppers and garlic is Out of This World! You will find a growing list of uses for it. Add it to Mexican, Chinese, and Italian dishes (carefully its hot!) Or put it on the table so your dinner guests can heat up their dishes individually. If you like spicey hot dishes you will love this chili garlic sauce!"
1,This sauce is delicious. Adds quite a kick to salsas or chilli. It's also good with eggs. Good for people who like spicy food. It has a wonderful flavor.
1,"I just tried this out for the first time, and I am going to make it a permanent part of my flavoring arsenal. It is strong/potent, so use it sparingly. This is a great option for anyone who wants to avoid the sugar content of the more famous 'Rooster Sauce'."
1,"There are a lot of Chili Sauces that I like, and it really depends on what I want to use it for, but when it comes to cooking, this is the stuff. I add it to any meat to make stir-fry, chili con carne, Thai dishes, burritos, etc. It's wonderfully versatile and can be used anywhere that garlic and chilies are appropriate. One of the reasons it's so perfect for cooking is because it's not all heat. You can add a good tablespoon of this to a dish and really mix it in without killing it. With, say, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CBFTC6"">Dave's Insanity Ghost Pepper</a> sauce you get lots of heat in a few drops, which can lead to uneven flavor in the dish."
1,Great taste and spicey hot. Great on pizza and chicken dishes. I've even used it in soups. Very potent so use sparingly.
1,"Just tried this in a new soup recipe with the miracle noodles and it was soooo good! Use just 1 tsp on a serving, it is very hot!"
1,This is a very tasty product but way overpriced on line.  The sauce is readily available at most markets at a much lower price (much lower).
1,"I grew up with this chili garlic sauce. My parents would usually use another familiar Huy Fong product <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00348H580"">Sriracha</a> for our foods. This Chili Garlic sauce is a whole another level. It is like dog treats for humans. It adds a lot to any dish, whether it's rice, chicken, pork, noodles, etc. The ingredients are mostly natural, which is a plus.<br /><br />Pick a jar up if you haven't already. It is truly a spicy treat."
0,"I was imagining a taste of smoothness (kind of like buttered rum toffee), instead,  bitter tasting.  Aroma was pungent.  It was like drinking rum(and bad rum at that!) without the butter which would have given some smoothness.  I will be throwing out the unopened coffee."
1,These noodles are the best. I have used them since first trying them about twenty years ago. They have a nice light taste and are not at all starchy. I am just disappointed to have  recently been notified that they are going to be discontinued. I hope that I will still be able to find them somewhere.
1,"My Italian husband likes his noodles; of all that he has tried, ready-made, DeBoles is his preference. And I like the fact that they are made with Jerusalem artichoke flour- healthful AND tasty!"
1,"The description on the product page is really spot on. It has a kind of nuttier taste than normal semolina or egg noodles, and is definitely far less starchy. You can overcook it a bit without it getting mushy eaither, which is nice if you lose track of time a little bit. I cant speak to it actually being gluten free. There seems to be some debate as to the accuracy of that, but it isnt a factor for me, so i havent really researched it. One other note is that the artichoke flour in question is actually Jerusalem Artichoke, which is different than the one people are familiar with, and in fact makes a great substitute for potatoes in its natural form. Anyway, this pasta is definitely a worthwhile purchase. Please be advised though....10 pounds of pasta is a large amount. Have something you can seal to store it in if you dont eat pasta every day. It will definitely stay fresh for longer that way."
1,These noodles are fabulous!  Even my kids love them.  I'm gluten intolerant and love having noodles back in my life!  These have wonderful flavor and texture and are amazing!
1,"Both steaks in The Celebration are sufficiently large, and the filet is amazing. The strip is good but not great, but can feed two."
1,The Flavacol Salt has a good flavor! It was very easy to use. We also bought the caramel and chocolate flavoring - which we also like. Shipped on time.
1,I use this stuff all the time especially now that i am studying 24/7.. had got it at a store locally but was to lazy and shipping was free.  Good price and they dont expire for like 7 months so 48 will be gone long before then!!! thanks for the quick shipping
1,As good as or better than the tea-bag version. Temperature is always right on with Keurig brewer so no more too hot over-steeping.
1,"I discovered this rub while shopping in Napa;t he saleswoman in the Tyler Florence store<br />recommended it , along with some of his other flavored rubs.  I bought one bag, rubbed it<br />on chicken and grilled it... WOW !!  Now I use it on lamb, potatoes, vegetables, even fish.<br />It is outstanding... just the right amount of seasoning with dried herbs; it is perfect on<br />everything.  In November the Thanksgiving turkey will be covered in it.<br />  I ordered 6 bags, along with the brown sugar rub for pork which is also<br />fantastic."
1,"We have had problems with our cat and her food in the past. She was having a few health issues so with some advice from the vet we decided to go with a more natural food than Science Diet. Like humans natural foods are better because they contain more of the vitamins and nutrients that the body needs. Our cat loves this food. She doesn't get ear infections or have feline acne anymore. She also have more energy and overall happier. The only downfall with it is that it is quite a bit more expensive than Science Diet or the like. However, I would much rather spend a little more for food than pay hundreds at the vet for preventable issues."
1,but slightly overpriced my one kitty last 3 month more or less with only 2 to 3 pound bags I recently purchased this from petsmart for 8 dollars for a 2 pound bag
0,"Got the Peppermint Mocha for Christmas and it was pretty good.  The mocha was not overwhelmed by the peppermint and I enjoyed all 32 oz of it. When it was about gone I checked the company's website for info and saw this one.  Peppermint Mocha is seasonal, but still I am looking for Mocha flavor.  White Chocolate Mocha...At the store where I got it they only had the 32oz.  Pulled it out of the cooler and checked the expiration date.  As soon as I got home I put it in the coffee and as I lifted the cup I got a waft of coconut, like I was on a hot sunny beach. The taste also gave me the impression I just took a sip of suntan lotion.  Not enough mocha like the Peppermint Mocha.  The ingredients have palm oil and I checked the Peppermint Mocha and it does too, but I never noticed it.  Not sure if I can finish the other 31.5 oz of this White Chocolate Mocha. One bad post mentions the taste another becauses of shipping, this IMO is another bad for the taste promoted as White Chocolate Mocha on the label. Should have checked the reviews here first...update...tried a little more.  Shook the bottle well. It's better than the first cup.  Still what I taste is a sweetened coconut with a little white chocolate, not the mocha punch that's in Peppermint Mocha.  I'll bump it up a star for the slightly less coconut, slightly more mocha(?) from the first impression."
0,I have never met a coffee creamer I couldn't stand until I tried this stuff. It's just horrible...the taste reminds me of how burned and melting plastic smells. I took 2 sips and I was absolutely disgusted. I threw my coffee out and brewed a fresh cup (skipping this awful creamer). I will NEVER buy this stuff again.
0,"I purchased this at my local store in a quart bottle. This flavor is bad... real bad. I felt like someone mixed paint in my coffee. Something is really off in the flavor, can you call paint a flavor? Because that is what this taste like, and sorta smells like. It has a plastic, weird, chemical taste, not good. I emailed the company, do the same if you bought it and do not like it, they will send you a coupon for FREE creamer. Just trust the reviewers here, don't get this flavor, someone screwed up at I.D. Someone needs to get fired for this or made a janitor. Try Almond Joy, I have been using that for months, it taste the best."
0,I'm afraid I must agree with most other on this.  This creamer is just awful.  It's like they pureed cardboard and added sugar.  I don't think the people that made it have ever had a white mocha before.
0,Does not taste like white chocolate at ALL! I just purchased this from the dairy section at walmart. It's terrible. Sucks because i bought a huge size thinking it would be good. hopefully i can return it. thought maybe it was just me since i am new to flavored creamers but i think the votes are in...stay away from this product.
0,"My wife is a flavored-creamer junkie, so I have tried a LOT of different creamers, so when I say that this is probably the WORST coffee creamer I have ever tasted, I know what I'm talking about. The chemical aftertaste is so strong, it's impossible to determine what the underlying flavor is. I honestly thought I had gotten a bad batch, but after reading all the reviews here, I realized that is how it is supposed to taste. Several of the other International Delight flavors have a slight aftertaste, but nothing like this!<br /><br />I'm not sure who they had taste-test this flavor, but whoever it is should be tested for brain damage, or maybe they just lost their sense of taste completely."
0,"I just bought this White Chocolate Mocha creamer in the dairy section of my grocery store, and I have to say...it's terrible!! I am so disappointed. I usually enjoy International Delight creamers, but I honestly dont know how this made it to the shelves. Did any of the International Delight workers try it before deciding to package it up and ship it out? It tastes like plastic. And I am very upset that I spent $4 on a 32 oz of this stuff...I wont even use it now. What a waste!!! I would give it 0 stars if I had the option to."
0,"I love white mochas, but this is horrible. I can't even drink it. I came on to see if others felt the same or if there was actually something wrong with my creamer. I guess I'm not alone in thinking this is horrible. I'm calling international delight tomorrow :/ how does a company let something this bad into stores!?!?"
0,"This is by far the worst coffee creamer I have ever used. I was at the store and I decided to try a new creamer and I picked this one because I never had international delight before. But this gave my coffee a horrible taste, I had to use at least 1/3 of this to coffee before it tasted kind of ok."
0,"I can't even describe the flavor of this creamer...it's definitely not chocolate or mocha.  It's terrible.  Like others have said, I thought maybe it was expired or may it was just one in the box that was bad.  I tried tasting some of the creamer alone (without coffee) and it was just as bad.  Hopefully the other flavors are better...kind of an expensive way to have to find out by buying a whole box and then not liking it.  Who'd have thought I needed to read a review about a creamer before buying."
0,This stuff does not taste good at all.  I thought that maybe it had gone bad or something but it's not close to expiring.  Definitely the worst tasting creamer I've had yet.
1,"I hate drinking my coffee black.  These white chocolate mocha singles are easy to keep in my desk at work, they don't need refrigerated unless opened.  I use 1/2 of a tub to a cup of coffee, any more and it's too sweet for me. Until I got the combination right (1/2 tub, 1 packet of Splenda), I didn't care for these. After experimenting some, they are pretty good.  I hope these eventually are offered with dark chocolate instead of white. The more chocolately flavor, the better!"
0,"Awful, awful, awful. After the first sip I thought I somehow screwed up the coffee without knowing it. I kept sipping, and with each swallow, I realized that it wasn't getting any better. This is the most disgusting creamer I have ever tasted. What a disappointment! The taste reminded me of burnt popcorn covered in moldy chocolate. Gross!"
0,"When I received this order, the outside of the box was wet from the leaking contents inside. The creamers were just thrown in the box and were not even in a plastic bag. It was a mess. I had to wash the few remaining creamers that were still in tact because everything was sticky and dirty.  I will not be ordering this item again."
1,Since I've lived in India and Pakistan; I know chai first hand...this is by far the only best powder form available...my friends all agree.
1,"Great Product, love it!  Add cinnamon to it, and it will taste even better :)"
1,Talk about comfort food and drink!  This is pure yummy at its best!  Pricey...and well worth every penny.  The steamy smell is intoxicating and the taste even better.  After a long hard day...wind down with this marvelous blend of chai spices.  Wow!
1,"My husband and I share a cup of this on a cold day.  We bought it first at marshalls and couldn't find it again.  We were able to get on line and get our shipment every 3 months automatically, this beats driving around looking for it as we have been doing."
1,"I ordered this product for my daughter who LOVES it! We had bought this product at Sam's Club in the past in a larger can, but they have not had it since. So when I found out I could order it online I bought several cans. My daughter drinks at least 1 cup a day of Chai, usually at night after a long day at school or when it is chilly. It is especially nice on rainy days, that chill to the bone, it really warms you up!<br /><br />She always drinks it warm but I have heard it was good over ice as well."
0,"The reason I gave this only 2 stars is not because of the taste. It tastes great! I actually had this at a restaurant for the first time, which is what prompted me to find it online and buy it.<br /><br />But, almost every ingredient is artificial. Hardly anything about this product is something I would willingly put into my body on a regular basis. It's a powdery mix when you open it and pour one scoup into a cup of hot water. It makes you wonder where the tea actually is.<br /><br />I don't recommend this highly processed, chemically manufactured, mostly artificial ingredients, product to anyone. Unless you just don't care what you put into your bodies and just want it for the taste."
1,My first purchase of this product was made from curiosity. I have been using it for a few years.  I really enjoy it and even share it with my cousin.
1,"I love the Chai latte @ Starbucks.  Since I couldn't find that at a reasonable price in Amazon, I chose to try Mocafe Divinity Spice Chai mix.  To my surprise, it came out really very well.  The Starbucks chai and this one are totally different things.  Both taste good in their own fashion.  Starbucks chai seems watery but this one is the thickest you will ever get.  Mocafe is highly creamy all the way down but Starbucks is not.  This is a powdery product, Starbucks is liquid product.<br />Again, I seem to love Mocafe even though I am a big fan of Starbucks Chai.  I highly recommend this to all the Chai lovers out there.<br />Note: This had a price advantage over starbucks chai when I initially bought.  But I later found that Costco is selling Starbucks chai at a very cheaper price."
1,I love that I can still have my Chai tea at work and not have to worry about having milk there. Tastes great!
1,"I have a cup every morning!  Cant describe it but it just makes me happy :)  its not too sweet and just the perfect amount of creamy (I mix mine w water)I have been buying this at a local small coffee shop at 13$ per can. I can't tell you how happy I was to find this on amazon for such an amazing price. If you are looking to try a new chai, look no further!"
1,"This Chai tea has a delicious flavor.  The only bad thing about it is that it doesn't dissolve completely no matter how hot the water is or how much you stir it, which makes the last 5 sips or so a bit gritty."
1,We have tried Chai at a number of venues as well as buying various brands to try at home. This is the hands down winner - and company always agrees. Cannot recommend this product more.
1,"I can never find this chai in the last 2 states i have lived in. so i order it here. I have tried other chai mixes that i can find at stores to replace it, but this one is the best. so delicious!"
1,"Paid over $4.00 for a cup of this at a coffee shop in town.  After raving about how delicious it was (and thinking of how I was going to need to come back...soon...for another cup) the owner told me it was MOCAFE.  She mixes equal parts of the spice and the vanilla chi tea mix and wow--it is amazing.  I was so happy to see Amazon has both flavors!  I buy them both, dump them together in a container and mix well.  Then I spoon back into the tin (I also put into jars and gave as Christmas gifts...well received!) and enjoy!  The only thing I add is a puff of whipped cream on the top of the mug.  Now if only they made a sugar free version...."
1,"this chai is the best! fast shipping, can only recommend it to everyone else!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you will love it,  i can also recommend the vanilla chai as well! great taste! love it in the fall and winter time"
1,"I enjoy drinking all types of tea, in loose and bagged forms, but this tea is a delight to drink.  It is a chai tea mix with the spice, sugar and milk already added so all you have to do is add hot water.  It tastes great cold as well and though it already has the added milk, I sometimes add a touch of coconut milk to it to give the 'spice' of it a little more exotic taste. Yet no matter how you may want to serve it, this all-in-one drink is a taste-tea, tea-licious treat!"
1,"I buy this all the time and drink it just about every day as my special treat.<br />I use soy milk or almond milk with it and it is delicious. I mix it with 3/4 cup hot<br />water and then 3/4 cup of whatever milk you want and then micro-wave again. My sister told me about it. That is how I found it. Then I found I could order ""MOCAFE<br />Precious Divinity Spiced Chai Tea Mix"" from Amazon."
1,If you like iced Chai - this is it.  Disolve powder in a small amount of VERY hot water.  Add ice and milk.  YUM x 2!!!
1,This chai is less creamy than some I have tried.  It is heavily spiced and I use less than the amount called for when I mix it with half water and half vanilla soy milk.  Tasty.
1,"You will love this Chai it is perfect for a chilly fall evening.  I purchased it to share with family and friends.  The product is delicious and the shipping was super fast. Try it, you will not be disappointed."
1,I was tired of paying $4 - $5 for each chait tea drink at the coffee shop but it was an adventure to find an at home product that tasted as good as the coffee shop.  THIS IS IT!  It is really delicious you won't be disappointed.  :)
1,"I have been drinking MOCAFE Chai for 6 years, always finding it at a discount retailer.  They no longer carry it so decided I would go to MOCAFE and see if I could purchase directly.  Was pleased to see that Amazon.com is now carrying --- I appreciated the free shipping as it saved a considerable amount and allowed me to buy more of my favorite, yummy, morning drink.  A great beverage for coffee drinkers and non-coffee drinkers like myself."
1,"We keep this stuff around the house and drink it during the winter a lot, as well as around just about any holiday.  It truly is amazing stuff!  Everyone I've had try it absolutely LOVES it.  It tastes like... pumpkin pie-it's awesome with whipped cream on top."
1,I have tried various chai teas and this is the only one that I LOVE!  I would go to ROSS to see if they had any more but I got tired of looking so I decided to see if they sold it online and the price on here is great.
1,"I am not a big coffee drinker, but several years ago someone turned me on to the chai tea latte at Starbucks.  During the winter, I tend to treat myself to a tall chai a couple days a week, which can really add up!  My sister bought me a tin of the Precious Divinity Spiced Chai Mix for my Christmas stocking this year and I LOVE IT!  It has a nice, mild, sweet flavor.  I just ordered a four pack of the tins for myself, and I keep one at work so I can enjoy a hot, caffienated drink in the morning.  Each serving is fairly small, but even if you make a double, you're still paying a lot less than you would at Starbucks. Very good stuff!"
1,"This is buy far the most delicious chai mix I've ever had, way better than what I've bought in actual cafes. I am never going to Starbuck's again."
1,"I originally purchased this Chai tea at Sam's and fell in love with it however, Sam's quit selling it at their stores.  I got online and found that Amazon.com sold it.  I was in love all over again!  I serve it with milk instead of water and put a little hazelnut syrup in it as well.  To top it off, I put whipped cream on top with a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar.  By this point, the tea has now become a decadent dessert instead of a hot tea.  Thanks to Amazon.com I received my tea in record time and the product was in perfect condition!  The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish the containers held a little more product.  Other than that, I love, love, love it!"
1,I love this stuff!!!!!!!!!!  Share with all your friends !!!!!!<br />watch the calories !!!!
1,"This is a weekend morning ritual for me and my wife.  The product is sweet, delicious, and keeps me going when I'm deployed overseas."
1,"I love this chai! Better tasting than Trader Joe's, Oregon Chai and Tazo. I love the Vanilla version too! I discovered it a few years ago and stumbled upon it at a discount grocery store. So now I order it using Amazon's ""Subscribe & Save"" feature."
0,"That's the best thing I can say about this formula.  Clumpy, does not dissolve and tastes pretty well nasty.  I'm trying to find people I can give the cans away to without feeling mean."
1,"Use the following recipe for this dip:<br />1 pkg Fiesta Ranchero Dip<br />1 cup grated cheddar cheese<br />1 cup real mayo<br />1 can chicken breast, drained<br />1 cup sour cream<br /><br />Mix all ingredients and serve in a small crock pot or warm up portions in the microwave on a low setting.  If it gets too hot the cheese will become oily and yucky looking.  Serve with tortilla chips.  Your guests will absolutely love this dip."
1,"I absolutely LOVE this dip, simple as made with pretzels.  However, when I went on a diet it got stuck in the back of my pantry until I discovered that using 2 cups of fat free Greek Yogurt produces a delicious low calorie substitute for the mayo and sour cream that the box calls for. So now, my favorite pretzel and veggie dip is back on the forefront of my snacking!"
1,I bought 2 boxes of this dip at a flea market.  I used both of them by Christmas and was afraid that I wouldn't be able to find them again.  I was so excited when I found them.  I will reorder them again and again....
1,"Just because of the bad review based on packaging above let me say Deboles makes top of the line pasta and we are extremely lucky to get the deals we do from amazon. You can pay double or triple the price in any store that sells this pasta. The recipe for their Jerusalem Artichoke pasta is the same for all types afaik so I would direct you to reviews of the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F0JOSO"">De Boles Pasta Organic Artichoke Fettuccine, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>. To that I can only add that with regular semolina pasta it took about double the amount to fill me up as the Deboles Jerusalem Artichoke which stands to reason because it's got 2x the protein. Just be advised with this deal (2.40/lb is a great deal) you'll want a tub or some kind of jar (2 gallons will do) to hold 10lbs of pasta."
1,"There's no going back!  Absolutely tastes like the real thing... the only difference is it's less sticky, a smother surface, which is a great difference.  I'll never miss wheat pasta!"
1,"DeBoles elbows are better than any other elbows I've tried. Believe me, at my age, that is a lot! However, as one reviewer stated, the product does come in a plastic bag.<br /><br />Rest assured, it IS what you are ordering.  How do I know? Went to another web site and viewed a large image of the elbows in the box from DeBoles.<br /><br />The pasta's are exact.  There is what appear to be cracks in the pasta.  All is good however!<br /><br />This product is genuine and excellent for your health. Especially if you are diabetic.<br /><br />I reordered these elbows to make macaroni salad for a friend who is diabetic.  She will appreciate that when she checks her glucose levels.<br /><br />Love this product and wish everyone would try it at least once."
1,This is best pasta I ever ate plus nutritional. I will never go back. Its worth increase in price to me & buying in bulk makes it affordable.
1,"I LOVE Snack Factory's Everything Pretzel Crisps. They are full of flavor but not too salty. I would be content living off of these crisps, veggies, fruit, and water for the rest of my life, seriously. Kudos."
1,"The first time I tried these I bought them at a local health foods store in my hometown.  I loved the taste but was discouraged from the price.  After checking out Amazon, I bought two (yes, I love them that much) cases of these Pretzel Crisps.  I am a closet snacker and have tried to find healthier alternatives to traditional snacks.  I pair these crisps with hummus for a delicious treat!! And the price was much better with Amazon!"
1,These pretzel crisps are delicious.  The flavor is very similar to Bruegger's everything bagels.  Shipment was perfect.  They arrived on time and the box was packed well.  No flattened bags with broken pretzels here.
1,"I am just trying to help you out. Do yourself a favor. Don't just buy one bag of these. I mean, if you live alone, maybe you will be okay, you might be alright. But for the love of all things good and fine in the world, if you plan to open these around other people or ::gasps in horror::: share them!!! then stock up by buying a few bags, not just one.<br /><br />Don't say I didn't warn you. They are everything an everything bagel is, but super thin and crunchy. Everything should be crunchy.<br /><br />Sheri Gill"
1,"Best low calorie snack that goes with any other foods. Put cream cheese on it; dip it in cottage cheese, eat it with an apple, try peanut butter on it, snack it plain when hungry and dinner is not ready, gives you a lift when you are tired from working out, take it for lunch with a sandwich or a wedge of cheese, have it with soup, have it with cocoa, coffee, tea or just munch some while watching TV. I love them!!!"
1,"I picked these up while grocery shopping and love them!  They do give me a slight, weird aftertaste (that ""everything bagels"" don't, so I'm not sure why)...but even that isn't enough to stop me from snacking on them.  I'm excited to try other flavors!"
1,"I took an oath, no more kettle chips...rice chips are good, not great. These pretzel chips are super crunchy but not hard on your teeth like some fancy brands I cant name that make their pretzels more like something the dog would love to chomp on. Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps are crunchy from being well toasted and thin, then sprinkled with caraway, sesame, poppy and salt; I think there's a pinch of other spices, but its so mild we used them for dipping.<br />They are darn delicious."
1,"I love these! If you look around, you'll find them cheaper else where! I got them for $3.69 a pack at my local store."
1,"I discovered and got hooked onto pu-erh during a recent trip to China and have only had the teabag variety thus far. Among the 3 brands I have tried thus far, one store bought, one an international brand, this is the best tasting pu-erh in a bag I have found.  I intend to try couple other brands available on Amazon.com or if I see in any of the local Asian grocery stores.<br />One thing that could be better about this brand is the bag around the tea bag, which is a bit hard to open (even though it has the guide slit). On the brigther side, each tea bag is individually wrapped in a 'plastic like' silver cover, which helps seal in the flavor very well.<br />Characteristics of this tea:<br />- 'fishy' like smell when you first dunk into hot water (not overpowering or nasty by any means)<br />- steeps fully in about 4-5 minutes<br />- neither bitter like the stronger black teas nor mild like the greens.  perfectly balanced somewhere in-between.<br />- satisfying flavor, makes me feel good about drinking a cup of tea.<br />If you have not tried this brand, worth giving it a shot.  I typically drink 4-5 cups every week and will likely get a refill ordered soon, unless I find an even better pu-erh out there.  Giving it a 4 star rating since this is a good buy, and my reference point is limited at present."
1,"I think the other reviewer's right about the under-cooking, but hadn't thought about it--partly because it didn't diminish my enjoyment of this soup at all. It's quite well-seasoned, with the beans giving adequate ""body"". Though I enjoy a number of other Dr. McDougall's soups, this is among my favorite."
0,"WORST PURCHASE I EVER BOUGHT OFF OF AMAZON AND I HAVE BOUGHT 100'S OF ITEMS THIS PRODUCT SMELLED LIKE A SMELLY OLD CLOSET. I THREW IN TRASH, MOST DISGUSTING SMELL, HAD TO BURN A CANDLE TO GET SMELL OUT OF MY HOUSE."
0,The tootsie pops were not fresh.  They were very old.. The outter covering was not crisp and brittle as all tootsie pops are. The outter covering was very soft and mushey and a lot of them had holes in them. And the inner tootsie roll was very small and looked old too.  The Green Apple flavor is very hard to come by in the assorted flavor bags. I loved the taste of the Green Apple Tootsie Pop that came in the assorted flavor bags so I thought I would I would order just that flavor in the 5lb bag.. .I was very dissapointed in the quality of the product.
1,"I got this Dinner of the Month Club pasta meal as a gift from a very special person back in CT where I used to live--I believe they are one of the leading gourmet presents companies nationwide.<br />The pasta is ready literally within 15 minutes--a quick meal is a good thing, especially for a single guy like me who doesn't have the time of day to cook complicated stuff--and not only that, it tastes excellent! (I added some parmesan cheese to the sauces that I got in my fridge and it made it even better). Honestly I wasn't expecting it to taste this good. As an Italian food fan, I was pretty satisfied with this gift. If you don't want to leave the house or what to stay home to watch the game, it's a perfect gift. Do I recommend their food and services? Absolutely! Giving gifts like these are a good idea for single people like me, so I am thinking returning the favor and sending these to some people I know for the upcoming holidays."
1,"I recently joined the dinner of the month club and I am so glad I did! It may be the best gift I've ever given myself:) My entire family reaps the benefits because it is a treat for everyone, no matter age or gender. We always look forward to the arrival of a new and exciting pasta in the mail every month. We even have a tradition now in our house that we all cook dinner together on ""pasta night"" and enjoy a savory dish provided by the dinner club.<br />It is so easy to make an impressive dinner with dinner club because they even send recipes to go along with their noodles and sauces! I recently received the Vegan Pumpkin pasta fettuccine paired with the Butternut Squash with Parmesan Cheese. I also got the Italian Spice Linguini with the Organic Roasted Garlic sauce. Even just boiling the noodles warms your home with a delicious fragrance. Everything I have ever received from Flying Noodle has always been of the highest quality. I have friends over to play dominoes every Tuesday night and I always brag about my Flying Noodle packages. They have tried most of my dishes and always want to know where they can get the noodles and sauces at our local grocery store. There is just nothing like it that you can buy from the store, I have since gotten all of my domino friends on Flying Noodle- dinner of the month club.<br />I definitely know where to go to do my Christmas shopping this year! There is something for everyone and I know I can trust Flying Noodle to deliver the best quality of products to my loved ones."
0,"I love Celestial Seasoning's Madagascar Vanilla Red tea, which is sadly becoming harder and harder to find in stores.  But don't order this item.  I placed an order for it, and had the order randomly canceled by the company.  The seller was listed as ABC Wholesale, and it is now listed as RED TAG sale, even though it's the exact same item.  Buy it from another source, it's a great tea.  I personally think it works great in combination with other teas, my favorite is a combination of four bags of this tea and one bag of plum black tea to make a gallon pitcher, which tastes great both hot or cold."
1,"These are a great, portable snack. Am so happy to have found them on Amazon as most local stores have stopped carrying this flavor."
0,I'm slowly working through these but it's a chore. The Glutino breakfast bars are very good and I ordered these because I assumed they would be good too.
1,I miss eating the way I used to before I found out I am allergic to wheat.  This is a great substitute for cream of mushroom soup.  You cannot tell the difference.  It tastes great!
1,My mom has a wheat allergy.  We have been unable to find Progresso Mushroom soup in stores here so looked here and could order it with free shipping.  Received the case in just a few days.  Looking forward to cooking all our recipes.
1,"I suppose that every coffee lover has their own favorite brands, roasts, and blends.  Well, Cameron's has become mine.  The Gold Cup is an excellent roast of coffee.  We're not talking about any fancy flavors or tastes, but just a good, straight up coffee.  I also mix about 50/50 of this with some of Cameron's flavored blends when the flavors seem too strong.  If you want something that's a good coffee but won't totally break your budget, give this a sip!"
1,"Ordered these for a quick out the door snack, they are perfect! Delicious and perfectly portioned. They have a great shelf life as well."
1,"I've ordered these cookies several times and never had any trouble with the packaging as the other reviewer has. More to the point, the cookies are absolutely delicious, and are always quickly devoured after I receive them."
0,"I ordered this before and I was very pleased with the product and vendor. This is my second time ordering this product and the item was sent to me open and the packaging was terrible.  I contacted the vendor and they were sorry for what happen and offered to send me a replacement. When the replacement came it was package correctly, but the replacement item was totally different from what I had ordered."
0,"I purchased this product as an alternative to a rawhide. Our 5 month old German Shorthair Pointer puppy ate it in a matter of 6 minutes or less. She loved it, but it was more of an expensive treat.<br /><br />With a puppy, I needed something to satisfy her chewing urge. The treat fractured into small bits all over the floor but our dog was willing to pick those up. The pieces looked rather sharp and that was a concern. Others mentioned it was made in China and I would like to add the first ingredient is corn.  It might last longer for very small dogs."
1,"I picked these up from my local pet shop for a bit cheaper than what they are on offer for from Amazon, so you might wish to shop around.<br /><br />Over all I am quite satisfied with these ""bones."" They are much safer than raw hide chews given they are made from dried chicken, which means unlike raw hide you know these are actually digestible. This is the biggest reason I bought them. My vet recommended not giving my Sheltie raw hide as they aren't properly digestible. Whether this is true or not, I've heeded her advice.<br /><br />Baird, my Sheltie, really seems to enjoy them. When he sees one coming out of the bag, his tail is wagging like crazy. He enjoys these as much as our old family Sheltie McGyver enjoyed raw hide. The only difference I see between these and raw hide is that raw hide lasted roughly 30 minutes longer in chew time than these. I'd say Baird can chew through one of these in about 30 or so minutes, while our old Sheltie could chew on a single raw hide for an hour, at which point we would throw away the little nub. There is nothing left of these bones after 30 minutes.<br /><br />As far as the dental application goes, it does smell of mint, so I assume it should, if nothing else, help with doggy breath, though to be fair Baird has never really had ""doggy breath."" I also use some dog mouth foam so I don't know what really keeps his breath ""fresh"" between the two.<br /><br />If you aren't too sure about raw hide for your dog and want something you know can be digested, these are definitely worth it.<br /><br />For those that try to keep track of where the things they give their dog come from, these are made in China. I've tried finding something similar not made in China, but it seems such a thing doesn't exist or I just can't find them."
1,"SmartBones Dental Dog Chews are the perfect treat for my two pomeranians and one Pembroke Corgi. No rawhide, nothing to upset their sensitive stomachs. They ""dance"" when I give them their daily chew."
1,"The girls lost their taste for rawhide, but were still looking for something to chew. They love these Smart Bones, and they are better for them as well. I will be reordering them when there gone!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047IOZ70"">SmartBones Chicken Dog Chew, Mini, 24-Pack</a>"
0,"Read your labels, people!!! SMART bones are made in China!!!!!! A neighbor told me how great these were. After buying them, I read the fine print in the back. ""Made in China!!"""
1,"there wonderful, my dog loves them, and I feel good giving them to him, I will always get these for him."
1,My dogs just love these and the chews are safe for them. Their breath benefits from the mint and their dental exams show much less plaque . I must keep bags on hand; they expect them.
1,I have given this bone to several different breeds and sizes of dogs and it is a major hit! And I don't worry about them choking on it as you do with rawhides. LOVE this product and will buy more!
0,"If you open the link to the Smartbones you will see that it shows a picture of a package containing a 3-pack of dog chews.  I did not get this bag, I recieved a single dog chew.  I was under the impression by looking at the description on the bag I was getting a single pkg of 3, Not just 1 dog chew.  This made these quite expensive and I ordered two :-("
1,"I've tried about 7 different dry foods and 3 different wet foods. Non of them, again NON made my dog have normal running intestines, ever. I started mixing in preference with Oma's Pride (wet) and it has been about 2 years that he has NEVER had intestines issues again. Highly recommended and worth every penny."
1,"Preference is an incomplete dog diet that is made complete by adding meat.  Preference is added with equal parts water and allowed to rehydrate for 5 to ten minutes.  Then you mix in meat an whatever else you feed your dog.  I usually mix it with a ground dog food from the butcher that contains ground beef, liver and heart.  I also throw in a couple of raw eggs and fish oil.  The dogs absolutely love it!  I've been feeding a raw diet for several years, and this product is a great supplement.  The chelated nutrients in Preference are more readily available for absorption in the digestive system, something that is hard to find in the vast majority of dog diets.  I don't feed Preference every day.  I make large batches, freeze in single serving sizes, and thaw them out for two meals per week.<br /><br />I also use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ZG2J40"">Urban Wolf Dog Food Mixer 3 lb Bag</a>, which is also an excellent product.  But what I love about Honest Kitchen is that they make their foods from human grade ingredients, most of which are sourced in the US.  After the scare with Chinese gluten poisoning so many pets a few years ago, I am careful about where my dogs' food comes from.  Note that many of the chicken/duck jerky treats are from China!<br /><br />Please note that this stuff STINKS while it's rehydrating -- I think it's the kelp or the alfalfa.  Once I add the meat, and it smells fine -- unless I add sardines!  I highly recommend using this product or a product like it if you're feeding a raw or otherwise grain-free diet.  Your dogs will thank you."
1,"My lab had to decrease some of her calories due to steroid induced hypothyroidism. Being that we already fed her a pretty limited diet as far as fat and calories go, cutting back even more was tough--after all, she's a lab..she's always hungry! Being able to bulk up her meal with this healthy veggie mix is a perfect way to fill her up but not OUT. It really comes in handy when I am low on fresh produce or am running late and don't have time to wash and chop. I add it to her raw in the morning and with her grain free kibble or canned at dinner. I love..love that it is made with some organic, human grade ingredients and she really loves it. I mix a tablespoon or so with yogurt for a snack between meals. Great product. Perfect solution for us."
1,have a lab with allergies and this is a great product to use.  Keeps the allergies down so she does not have to be on shots.
1,"This Preference veggie mix has been an important addition to our dogs' daily meals for the past 2 years.  I first began using one of Honest Kitchen's other products, Thrive, when our youngest dog (still a pup) was diagnosed with severe hip dysplasia.  I chose to use a bunch of natural supplements/herbs to deal with his joint mobility/pain rather than twice-daily strong prescription meds that would destroy his liver.  It put him off his food though since he didn't care for the taste of some of the supplements; so I tried to add plenty of good-tasting, healthy additions to his kibble (Pure Vita) to encourage him to eat.  The ""Thrive"" dehydrated mix was convenient...meat and veggies together...and I still occasionally use it for that convenience when the dogs are being kenneled or kept by others.  For regular daily use though, I use the Preference veggie base and add my own chicken, turkey, salmon, or bison.  I find it a bit more economical to just add my own protein source since I go through quite a bit (2 dogs, and 1 is huge).  Another thing that I like about the Preference mix is that one of the first two ingredients is alfalfa which has been shown to help with joint inflammation...just what my big guy needs.<br /><br />I usually mix up enough for a couple days worth of meals and just keep it in the fridge.  I just scoop the appropriate amount into each dog's bowl and then mix in the supplements for each pooch.  I then stir in the meat and kibble along with salmon oil.  They love it and they're both doing great on it!"
1,Bought this to add into my own meat mixture for the dogs and they just love it. It's easy to make in any size and really fast.
1,"Having recently moved here from Germany I was concerned to find a good mixer for the otherwise home prepared, raw food that I have been feeding since 2001. A Breeder friend of mine suggested the honest kitchen preference and I certainly did not look back. My dogs do very well on it and even tough the price appears high at first, buying all the ingredients seperately would be far more costly. Well done to the company for creating an excellent product that makes feeding a balanced raw diet much less complicated. I am very comfortable in advising my puppy buyers to use this product."
0,this company is against dog breeders of all kind. In their eyes all breeders are puppy mills... no exceptions!<br />Boycott their products until they wise up!
1,"Crunchy is the key word here.<br /><br />I purchased these snack bars because they don't contain the usual bugaboos: high-fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils, artificial sweeteners, etc. However, they're mighty hard to chew. And that's *probably* a good thing.<br /><br />I'm a hardcore fan of Quaker Oats granola bars, because they're a quick snack and they're heavy-laden with sugar, but they also have the HFCS (bad, bad) and hydrogenated oils (bad, bad, BAD). However, they are easy to chew (probably because of the nice, soft plastics they contain). I am striving to slowly back away from the QO granola bars because of their unhealthy and lengthy ingredient list.<br /><br />The Kashi brand snacks are agreeable to the palate and they do have enough sugar for my personal tastes, but I have a couple crowns and I wonder if my over-priced prosthetic teeth can survive this healthy eating experience.<br /><br />That being said, these are the snacks of choice for long car trips. For one, I'll never pig out on them and two, they're good for the tummy. They provide a little energy boost and they're high octane fuel for this four-layer bio-suit we call a human body.<br /><br />I'm working my way through the different flavors. My favorites are the pumpkin spice and peanut butter, yet honestly, I can't discern an enormous difference between these three (pumpkin, PB and honey toasted)."
1,"these are awesome little crunchy bars that taste just like the nature valley ""oat and honey"" ones, but with much better nutritionals and ingredients. a great, filling, slightly sweet snack!"
1,Great breakfast bars-they keep me full until lunch.<br /><br />It is hard to believe that these are good for you-they taste like graham crackers! I love them.<br /><br />The [...] price is terrible though-You can actually buy 12 boxes on [...] for cheaper! 12 boxes is about $[...] bucks on their site.  Amazon usually has the better deals but not this time.
1,"These bars are so great....they taste good, its convenient to have them auto-shipped to us, and on top of that, they are healthy for me and my family."
1,"It was a good buy, I really like Kashi products and the shipment arrived on time."
1,"I usually grab granola bars to keep me feeling ""full"" between meals, and today I decided to try Kashi's Honey Toasted 7 Grain.<br /><br />They are very crunchy. I prefer crunchy bars over the soft and gooey stuff, though. I really hate the soft chocolate drizzled bars from fiber one / fiber plus that taste excessively artificial.<br /><br />These bars taste absolutely fantastic. This probably won't be a bar that I buy to eat in between meals, as I ended up eating them INSTEAD of dinner. They're sweet, but not too sweet.<br /><br />To me, they are my second favorite granola bar, just under kashi's fruit and nut pumpkin bar."
1,"I bought these without really reading the box, just searching for healthy honey granola bars and since I love Kashi these were simply grabbed off the shelf.<br /><br />They are VERY crunchy. Don't both eating them if you need to hear anything that is being said in the immediate vicinity. But man they are tasty and very filling. I usually only eat one out of the pack and I'm full."
1,"When our local grocery stores started stocking only the chewy Kashi breakfast bars, my husband went into a panic.  His absolute favorite is the Kashi Crunchy Honey Toasted 7 Grain eaten with a banana every morning.  Thanks to Amazon.com, we now have a regular shipment scheduled every 3 months.  Mornings are happy once again!"
1,"My whole family likes these crunchy snacks.  They are good in the car, at work or wherever when rushing from school to sports practice.  They do tend to spill crumbs easily.  Of course after I bought a case of them, my daughter decided she liked chewy ones better, but she still eats them.  I was a bit disappointing at the price - once I did the math I realized that these can be gotten cheaper from the local supermarket."
1,Very tasty and keeps me from eating junk food in between meals...perfect diabetic snack !!
1,The Kashi TLC Crunchy Granola Honey Toasted 7 Grain is very yummy.  Wonderful honey taste.  I guess the only thing I could say negative is the bar brake up in the package.  Also it is pretty crunchy so you need good teeth! The negative do not out wave the positive in taste and quality so I still give this product 5 stars.
1,"Kashi bars are great, check them out!  This was a huge order though, they start getting boring at a certain point haha."
1,My family just loves the Kashi Crunchy bars. We go through so many that this was an excellent buy for my house!
1,"These bars are very good, and I don't feel guilty eating them. They are very crunchy, like Nature Valley bars are, but they're more ""natural"" tasting. They're a little more ""brown"" than Nature Valley. I bought a whole case, and I'm not sorry. I'm sure I'll eat them up before the expiration date!"
1,"This is my go-to brand and flavor, since I can't find any Ichiban ramen on Subscribe  and Save. One of the 'top-drawer' choices of ramen."
1,"I quote the word ""instant"" because, to the uninitiated, it might come as a shock that you actually have to boil the noodles rather than simply soak them in boiling hot water.  The preparation time is still very quick, and it's definitely worth it.<br /><br />These noodles are far thicker and chewier than your standard supermarket Top Ramen noodles.  They also come with a spice package and a dry ingredients packet that contains bits of seaweed, mushrooms, and carrots.<br /><br />I usually only put in about 3/4 of the spice package and add extra ingredients like nappa cabbage, shrimp, scallops, green onions, mung bean sprouts, and/or an egg.  Kimchi also goes really well with these noodles.<br /><br />The bulk price that Amazon offers is an excellent deal, especially for people who don't have access to Asian supermarkets.  It's the perfect food to have for when you want a quick and flavorful meal."
1,"been eating these noodles since the mid eighties. sad nong shim has discontinued the jam pong noodles. lllllooooove these noodles. i've been driving round trip two hundred miles to get them. now that i can no longer drive, i'm so happy amazon will deliver them to my front door!!!!!!! hope i can get them in a nursing home about twenty five years from now. john"
1,"First of all, I must state that this is the tastiest pre-packaged soup known to mankind. The spice mixture is a delight to my taste buds. The noodles are better quality than most pre-packaged Ramyuns. The ease of cooking this is just what you would expect. It's simple and that is why I'm often inclined to make this a meal when I know that I shouldn't. I opt to live a little in these situations.<br /><br />Preparation is key. The soup by itself is probably a health hazard if you eat it each and every day. As others have mentioned, it has little to no nutrients of particular value for any diet, and high sodium content. However, when one adds a variety of meats and veggies, it could possibly be gourmet caliber soup.<br /><br />I particularly enjoy cubed pork tenderloin or shrimp, mixing that with the soup. Poaching an egg or two in this soup will make it better as well. As for veggies, green onion is a definite must have, along with shitake/portobello mushrooms (I like both), and I like to add broccoli. Many times, I'll add bean sprouts and cilantro, but those are truly optional in my opinion. However, a personal favorite of mine to add to this soup is fishcake. If you don't know what that is, don't let the name fool you. Go to your local Korean market and pick some up. It's sensational in this soup.<br /><br />As for the unhealthy aspect, simply use less of the packaged spice and you'll probably feel better about yourself. I use the whole thing myself, but I really don't eat these as much as I used to. Lastly, the soup without all the additional meats and veggies is still tasty, so it's not a necessity to add the extras - only recommended. I still must suggest that one poached egg be the bare minimum. Enjoy!"
1,"Our family loves these udon type noodles, thick and chewy. Very spicey so we only use half a pack of seasoning for each."
1,"fast delivery, didn't expect it would arrive so fast. And the packaging was nice too!"
1,"I don't claim to be a noodle connoisseur and you shouldn't read it as such.  I have tried a limited number of ramen noodles, and most of them don't taste that great to me.  Something about plain chicken flavor ramen noodles leaves me dead inside.  There is a long laundry list of foods I rather each than that dreadful Maruchan Chicken Noodle flavored soup that I grew up eating.  Which explains why I hate that brand so much.  Enter Shin Ramyun noodles.  My mother bought this years ago through her Korean co-workers.  Initially I hated it.  Then some time passed and I learned that you can modify the ramen noodles to your hearts desire.  Well that was a game changer for me.  I started off with a egg and some frozen vegetables and haven't looked back.  Nowadays when I am looking for something cheap and quick (But not necessarily healthy because honestly when has anything cheap and quick wins up healthy and taste good?  Yeah I though so) I use Shin Ramyun noodles as a base.  What I would do is this: boil the water till hot, add my protein (be it egg, shrimp, fish, etc), then add the freeze-dried vegetables, then add a small amount of the seasoning packet (or usually none at all), keep boiling till soft/cooked.  Then I would add my vegetables (frozen or fresh), let it cook for a while, then I would add my noodles last and turn off the stove and let it sit in the soup mixture for about two to five minutes.  I like my noodles firm so I always add my noodles last.  The worst thing in the world is mushy noodles.  Then I would add my hot sauce (either the Sriracha[sic] sauce or the Korean hot pepper paste) and if I am feeling fancy, I would add some radish top kimchi and I am in heaven.  Basically I learn to experiment to see what I liked.  You don't have to use the seasoning packet.  Heck I learned that folks add butter to the noodles and eat like that, which is different (read strange as h*ll) to me but as long as they are eating it, who cares."
1,"Yummy ramen.  Very spicy, but this has lots of seaweed, and the noodles are great - tick and chewy.  If you want to avoid some of the sodium & fat don't eat all of the broth - focus on the noodles!  Add veg for more nutritional content ;)  Ramen is supposed to be quick and easy and cheap and filling, not a ""superfood"" - all ramen are really bad for you.  This one is one of the better ones taste-wise.  And no I'm not Korean - I'm actually Eastern European!"
1,"Good Spicy Korean Instant Noodle. It will open up your sinus, great for cold weather."
1,"This is one of the best instant noodle I have ever had. Be warned. It is very spicy if you put in all the spice in the red chilly pack. There are some other flavor of this kind, but seafood flavor seems to be the best of all."
1,"Nong Shim Neoguri Spicy Seafood Noodle Ramyun, Family Pack, 4.2-Ounce Packages (Pack of 30) is a good product, easy and quick to make. some say it's too seafoody, but I think it has a good light seaweed taste. my Korean friends use this product along with some added cut green onions, fresh thinly sliced mushrooms and garlic and a little soy. this size packaging is the best value and is packed as family size 6 - five bag packages."
1,Nong Shim makes great ramen noodles.  This one has great flavor and the noodle is fairly thick and tasty.  However you need to add more water than the package suggested or it's going to be salty.  It's best to cook it in the pot with boiling water for 4 minutes and the noodle texture tastes different than my lazy ramen noodle mode (soak it in boiling water for 4 minutes).  Give it a try and their rest of the lineup (especially the udon bowl)!
1,"When I bought this, I didn't realize the noodles are different from Ramyun spicy picante.  Ramyun is the thinner yellow noodle and neoguri is the thicker white japanese udon noodle.  Unlike the kimchi flavor, this has enough spices to satisfy your craving and since I do not dislike udon noodles, I give it 4 stars.  But it is not as good as Ramyun picante and I give ramyun 5 stars.  My boyfriend is german / irish American and he loves these noodles...even this spicy neoguri.  I believe the fishy smell would be for the seafood flavoring.  This is for a 30 pack/case and there is a 20 pack/case which may be cheaper.  So if you still aren't sure, try a pack before you buy a case."
0,"I'm a bit surprised how foul this soup smells and tastes. I doubt that many, unless their ethnic roots are Korean or similar, will find this soup pleasing. The taste is a bit odd, to say the very least. The actual taste is hard to describe but ""seafood"" is certainly not the word I'd use to describe this product. Seafood implies to me - either fish or shellfish. The closest I can come to an adequate description of this soup is it has the smell of drying seaweed and/or the aroma of fish food.<br /><br />As someone said in the comments section of this review: ""I just couldn't get past the smell.""<br /><br />Beyond the unusual seaweed flavor (which I obviously didn't like) --- there are only three other dominant tastes - a VERY heavy dose of salt, the bitterness of MSG and a lot of cayenne pepper. The noodles are essentially tasteless yet ladened with 500 calories of saturated fats. The MSG just adds to the unpleasant flavor notes. To be clear - this is a highly processed ""food"". In fact, very few of the soup's many ingredients are even recognizable as any type of food.<br /><br />HEALTH WATCH: While I'm not a health nut - this soup crosses even my very low bar for products that are better off avoided. One packet of this soup provides almost 90% of an individual's daily allowance of salt and 40% of the allowed Saturated Fats (thanks to the palm oil used to fry the noodles). While many of us think of soup as a reasonably healthy product - that is simply not the case with this soup. Each packet of this soup has about 500 calories.<br /><br />HEADS UP - some of the reviews on Amazon strike me as a bit suspect: There are a number of 5 star reviews generated by One Time ONLY Amazon reviewers. Once these ""reviewers"" have promoted this company's product - they never publish another review. I've seen this same pattern, time after time, for all the other soups made by this particular company.<br /><br />Even if you have no concern about salt, calories or saturated fats - the smell and taste I doubt will appeal to many."
0,"I had a real craving for ramen a few days ago, and considering that the Spicy Picante from Nong Shim was pretty good, I decided to give this a try when I saw it at my HyVee.<br /><br />Like the other reviewer, the smell itself was a huge deterrent. I, too, came to the conclusion that it smelled like fish-food the second I got a waft of it, and my friend agreed.<br /><br />The noodles are good as they're much thicker/chewier. The taste of the broth, though, was just down-right disgusting. To me, it just tasted like spoiled fish. One bite and it was in the trash. Ran back to the store and bought a package of Spicey Picante."
1,"I first got introduced to the Greenies brand with my cat who took to it like a bee to honey. Happy to report that dogs love the canine version just as much. The Value Tub guarantees your dog will be taken care of when the End of the World arrives ;) Slip a few in the pocket, bring a dog travel bowl like this one <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008CJ5N26"">Bliss Paws Collapsible Dog Travel Bowl-Strawberry Pink</a> and you're off to the races!"
1,"This is a regular item on my shopping list. Now that I see they have them for online ordering for almost $10 less than at my local pet shop. I know where to buy them.  They come in a larger quantity and are less expensive, so I don't have to order as often as I would normally have to go to the store. My dogs will do anything for these healthy treats."
1,"My 2 small dogs LOVE these.  It keeps their breath fresh and does actually minimize tartar build up on their teeth. One of my dogs is not food motivated and could care less about chewing on bones and chew toys. BUT, she goes absolutely nuts for these. They are not messy and the new formula digests just as well as their dog food. I give each of my dogs one per day so I buy them in these bulk packages. I highly recommend these."
0,"Greenies tries to position itself as a healthy treat, but I'm not so sure.<br /><br />My dogs love them, but buyers should be aware that one of the main ingredients in Greenies is wheat, which, according to my vet, sticks to teeth like glue. In my mind this makes the product as deceiving as lip balm companies who put alcohol into their products. Buyers should also be aware of how much sugar is used in these products, which probably contributes to the high caloric value. I also take huge issue with the high cost and wasteful -- often non-recyclable -- packaging.<br /><br />Overall, dogs love them, but they really aren't very healthy. You're better off giving them a cheaper rawhide stick, which does a much better job of cleaning teeth."
1,These thing are like crack for dogs. I am not sure of the make-up but the doggies sure love them.
1,My shih tzu absolutely loves these.  He knows when it is time for bed and he gets his special bone. He lays on the bed and smacks in pure bliss. I will buy them again and again!
1,"My Cavalier is the best dog ever!  Whenever I went to the pet store I would look at these and want to buy a big box.  Due to the price I usually just picked up one or two singles for a nice treat.  He loved them!  I saw them on Amazon and decided to be a kind pet owner and get him a box.  Everyday about noon he gets one.  I know when it's noon because he walks up to me and puts his paws on my legs and then turns circles.  When I say, ""Do you want a Greenie""?  he goes nuts and runs to the cabinet where I keep them.<br />Happy dog<br />Happy owner"
1,"Our poodle gets one every evening as a special treat. He loves them. I always keep a good supply on hand. It is not only a treat, but it helps clean their teeth."
1,My dog loves Greenies. They clean her teeth wonderful and is a great snack for her.  I have a very small dog so we cut them in half so they'll last longer.  I was pleased when we found them on Amazon at the price they sell them plus free shipping.  I love Amazon.
1,"Greyhounds notoriously have bad breath.  I first bought Greenies years ago when my first greyhound, Sophie, was alive.  She very much enjoyed these treats and her breath improved, at least a little.  Several dogs later, I was excited to bring a box of Greenies back to Mexico to give to my two dogs, Etheldreda - a greyhound, and Sadie - a greyhound mix.  I'm sorry that I can't find them in Mexico and I hate to ration out the Greenies because of the short supply.  Greenies are expensive, but they do help with the dogs' bad breath.  And my dogs love Greenies."
1,"My dogs look forward to their daily treat of Greenies.  Daily reward plus breath freshener for dogs.  Great price for the value size container, fast shipping."
1,"They love it, and I love the price here. I have two yorkies and they both have one a day. Saving a little in the things they use daily is great. It is the same product as in the pet store."
1,"My dog is still young, so no teeth problems yet.  She knows when I say toothbrush, she's getting a Greenie....the last thing she gets to eat at night.  For once, something that is good for her is also somethings she enjoys."
1,"I love greenies as a treat for my American Staffy.  She has never gotten sick after eating these treats.  They clean her teeth and keep her breath fresh.  Unfortunately they are very expensive and even at a discounted price, at $1+ per treat, it is quite pricey.  I may look at comporable brands that are less costly, since she eats any type of treat thrown her way.  I am lucky that she is not picky."
1,My dog loves Greenies. It is usually a rare treat because it is so expensive. I was thrilled to find this lightning deal. I only wish that I could have bought more than one canister. Thanks for giving Scooter 24 days of delicious treats.
1,My dogs get all excited when I come home since they will get a Greenie as a treat.  They love the taste plus it cleans their teeth.
1,"We had a dog for nearly 16 years, who had terrible teeth and foul breath, and ended up needing surgery to remove 19 teeth.  She had infections under the teeth into the bone beneath.  She ended up with kidney disease and we lost her several months ago.  We now have a 1 year old pit/lab mix, Daisy, who will not let us brush her teeth, and I am determined to keep her teeth healthy.  Daisy gets one regular greenie (she weighs 57#) after her evening meal.  Daisy goes bonkers when I open the package, dancing all around the kitchen.  She loves them so much. Daisy gulps down her food, but the texture of the greenies forces her to take her time when she eats them.  So far her breath is not even noticeable, and her teeth are pearly white.  Also, I never give her wet food, which sticks to her teeth.  And, she chews on nylabones throughout the day.  Buying this through amazon.com saves me at least $10, so I am happy to get this online.  The packages always arrive on time and in good shape.  When the weather was very hot and humid here, I did get one box where some of the greenies were stuck together, but the individual greenies were still in good shape.  I highly recommend this product."
1,i didnt buy them off of here simply because i get them cheeaper at petsmart<br />however i will say that my dog loves them! i swear she can eat them in 10 minutes and shes only six months old! i always tell people how much she loves them
1,Good product.  My 5 yr old cocker spaniel LOVES 'em.<br />Great pricing and prompt delivery.  Very satisfied.<br />Will order again when they're used up.
1,"Ijust need to tell you, My dogS LOVE GREENIES. Besides Variety Snaps, These are my  FAVORITE. one of my smaller dogs, Cloie. Had THE WORST BREATH. now since Greenies, I would let her Kiss me. Thank Yor So Much For Continuing to carry thtm.<br /><br />Sincerely<br />Grey Steinke"
1,"I'm very happy & please with the entire process. it is not the first time I order it, so I wil keep ordering."
1,"received the next day, my dog's favorite treat.  He needs them daily for his tarter and it is much improved!!"
1,This is great!!! first time my dog had greenies is when I bought a single. He is a picky eater and we were desprate to do something about his breath. He loved it and helped his breath. We buy big boxes of them now.
1,My dog loves these treats.  They really help to keep her teeth clean in between brushing. They also help her breath stay fresh and works well as a reward when she is good.
1,My dogs bark at me every morning until they get their Greenie treat. They are addicted to them. I have 3 dogs so it is a bit pricey but that is why I order from Amazon so that I can keep up with their addiction! We use two different sizes of Greenies and the teenie size is good but then they want more than one. If I give them the size larger then I can get away with only one treat per day. I do not know what they put in these but my dogs are crazy for them.
1,"I can't really speak to how well it leans teeth, but my dogs likes them.  I say likes because he doesn't go nuts for them, but he will eat them.  Overall I think it is a good product and I would reccomend buying it."
1,"These are great treats, in moderation.  I find if Mollie (63 pound Golden) gets more than three per week, her stool ""greens up"".  Also, she likes variety.  The seller I frequent is fast, always packages well and the price is right."
1,My pug loves these. Great little treat for her and I know it's also helping to clean her teeth while she just likes the taste.
1,"My dogs love greenIes.  They may not understand anything else, but they they understand greenies.  Every time I ask my partner to give them greenies, all there of them jump up and run to the and state at the container it is in.  They get there before us.  I have shepherd, lab, and blue tick.  Shepherd is the picky dog.  She does not like Hyde or even dog biscuits, but she loves these"
1,"I've tried to find a ""dental"" treat to feed my 2 year old Yellow Lab for the past 6 months. None of the recommended chews nor treats did the trick, she plain refused them upon first sniff. I took a chance on the greenies based on some quick and dirty research, and am sure glad I did. She absolutely devours them in no time flat. For a somewhat picky eater (an extreme rarity in the world of Labs) these proved a fantastic purchase."
1,"These are great, both my dogs love these. so glad they shipped semi fast, and have a bunch to last me a few months. def recommend!"
1,"My JRT is very picky and won't eat most treats, but she loves her Greenies and her mom (me) loves how they clean her teeth and breath."
1,Recevied the Greenies before the expected delivery date.  Great value compared to the pest food stores.  Big plus not having to deal with car and foot traffic.  Dogs are happy and that makes me happy!  Thank you and keep up the good work.
1,"Fast delivery and good pricing for cost. Only wish they were even less expensive as a product.<br /><br />Interestingly, it's a cardboard box they come in...always thought it was plastic... :)"
1,THIS ONES ARE GREAT FOR MY 20 POUND DOG. THE RULE OF THUMB TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE THE CORRECT SIZE OF GREENI IS IF IT TAKES HIM MORE THAN 1 MINUTE TO FINISH IT AND LESS THAN 2 THEN YOU HAVE THE RIGHT SIZE.
1,This is a great bargain - a much better deal than I can get at my local pet store. I use these as special treats for my dogs - not an everyday thing but for especially good behavior or when I'm compelled to pamper them.
1,My dogs love Greenies and my cost savings purchase with Amazon was perfect timing for me as I was almost out.
1,"We previously got a few of these at a local pet store to see if our dog liked them. Sure enough, she loved them. They are quite costly compared to other dog treats but they do a good job with keeping her breath ""fresh"" and as previously mentioned, she loves them."
1,"These lower calorie Greenies are just what our dog ordered, or would have if he had fingers.  They are great for his teeth--and waist line--and beat brushing."
1,"Package description reads canister, therefore I was expecting a canister/container containing the dog treats.  The product box contained two resealable pouches upon receipt."
1,Nothing gets our dog's tail wagging like a Greenie!  I like that they come with a zip-top inner pouch to keep them fresh.  That way I can buy the big economy tub and save a little $$$!  Thank you Greenies!
1,"I love this brand's granola. All the flavors are great but this one is the best. Great as a snack, great as cereal with some milk, great over greek yogurt."
1,"When I found myself the owner of a dog so smart that I could tell her to unlock the car door and she could do it ( I kid you not, Biscit has the brain of a human 4 year old...) I began to look at animals differently...she truly became even more my my ""baby"" each day.<br /><br />Now let me backtrack into the day I decided to begin researching dog food with this baby in my life...<br /><br />I was a physician recruiter and had to visit a hospital in a town in Texas where they have more cows per capital than anywhere else in the U.S. in order to utilize them for human consumption.  I had several tours of this town and found out by the owners of several companies that it was no accident one of the largest dog food manufacturers is also here. (It is not Newmans own...bear with me)<br /><br />At first that sounds good to you, doesnt' it? That they must be using, for this other company, food grade meat in their dog food? Well, I personally, first hand, watched bull dozers pick up dying and dead cattle. I was proudly told how smart it was that THESE cows are then taken to the dog food plant. (remember, this is NOT Newman's Own, it was what lead me to find Newman's Own) (!) I had many conversations about this...no they dont find out what's wrong with the cows. They are the cancerous, diseased, unhealthy cows that go into this other maker's food. I was appalled. And yes, I was told how great it was because they buy them for nothing from the cattle company and no they aren't supposed to...but they can and they were ever so proud.<br /><br />Fast forward to a couple years ago with the dog food recall when pets were dying from diseased meat being in their food because of this very reason...cows with diseases so bad that it made pets die got into many brands of the cheap commerical dog foods.<br /><br />The reason why Newman's Own was one of a handful of companies who had no recall? They are one of the few companies that use FDA certified HUMAN GRADE meat. See label.<br /><br />Yep, they are allowed to put things that are not allowed to be eaten by humans in most other dog foods...unless you find a company that uses food grade meat. Most people dont know this!<br /><br />Better yet, Newmans' own uses organic.<br /><br />I'll be honest, I dont use this food all the time. I learned about it from someone who shows Pomeranians and uses this because her dogs coats look better because it helps their health. I actually make a lot of my dog's food after my day at the cattle plant that I unwittingly visited. But I am not always long on time and when I find myself there, I use these or a dry dog food that's organic and human grade from Flint River Ranch, another company a vet told me about.<br /><br />Okay so on to my studies for the past 5 years in dog health. This became fascinating to me...many vets found that many health related issues with dogs began (or multiplied) when commercial dog foods began being made for convenience. Think about it...not only are they suddenly not getting food grade food unless you buy something like Newman's Own, but humans are told how bad processed food is, yet dogs eat the same thing each day, processed food. Many vets are on board to change this in spite of the fact that most veterinary schools are funded by the major dog food manufacturers...so...you figure that out...<br /><br />(p.s. in the old days dogs got table scraps...but these table scraps were in the days before humans ate processed foods with artificial ingredients and preservatives...so dogs eating the meats and vegetables were healthier than today when we buy special food for them!  But bear with me...Newman's Own has changed all this!)<br /><br />So anyhoo...the best place for info is to go to dog shows and ask about diet because health is studied here for coat and longevity and ease in litters etc when it's thier living and life. I have yet to meet a champion who eats commercial dog food unless it's organic with the balance of minerals,veg, good carbs, etc. like Newman's Own. Many also do a raw diet with veg and brown rice.)<br /><br />Many of the minerals needed in the commercial brands are actually added then baked out and many have cornmeal as the main ingredient because it's cheapest...<br /><br />if you look at the nutritional info on Newman's own, even if you don't care that it's human grade and organic, you will see that the balance of protein, vitamin, minerals, etc is ALL the exact measure now studied by dog health experts as ideal.  This is hard to find.<br /><br />So, should you, too, have a dog that is a member of the family, my 5 years of research has led me to praise the Newman's Own label (even for what I eat for myself in their other HUMAN grocery products!) and if you want to supplement this dog food with home cooked meals the best guide to curing your dog through a diet natural to what they need is Dr Pitcairn's book of natural health for dogs and cats. (get the most recent edition if you do; he updates them the more he researches.) He's studied this far more than I'll ever be able to and is a top vet who teaches other vets about what they dont learn in vet school: major PREVENTATIVE measures through natural diet.<br /><br />He began his own quest when someone brought in either a wolf or coyote and he made the connection that whenever he saw wild dogs they didn't have teeth with tartar build up and so many health issues that our house dogs who aren't outside as much wind up with--then he started tracing back to when some of the cancers and skin problems etc began and it was with the emergence of commercial cheap dog food. Coyotes get veg from the tummies of what they kill, there are minerals, things they need from bones, there are things that naturally prevent tartar, fleas etc that we have removed from the diet of our house dogs. (my own dogs now have coats so shiny strangers comment each time I take them out...and p.s. we live in the woods and they have no fleas!)<br /><br />I, personally, have helped friends CURE ""health"" issues in their pets that were actually food issues that their vets kept ""treating"" without ever suggesting they change to a natural diet. They spent tons on medicine for skin problems etc then at my prodding gave them GOOD dog food and ""cured"" them!<br /><br />Newmans Own has taken dog food out of the profit center and into care. While it can't cure all ails as much as balanced vitamin enriched homemade food may in my opinion, it is a staple in my pantry. I also use Flint River Ranch at the recommendation of my vet who studies the same issues. He loves them both.<br /><br />I am a raving fan.<br /><br />and, p.s. no I have no monetary interest in this company which isI why I also recommended other food options and brands...but I care enough about animals to be long-winded due to my years of study on it."
1,"Everyone knows about tainted pet food from China.<br /><br />Newman's Own is a branding that I can trust, and this one is a real winner.  Newman's is what I would make if I were making it for my own family, as in you can trust that it is great tasting, good for you and safe to eat.  I'm very pleased that the Newman's line was extended from people food to pet food.<br /><br />When it comes to moist dog food every single choice on the market has meat by-products except Newman's Own.  My 3-month old puppy goes crazy for this, as well as for the Chicken-only Newman's canned dog food variety.  In fairness he would probably go crazy over meat by-products too.  While they *may* never hurt his health, I won't give him any, that lucky dog.<br /><br />One other finding:  When you open almost any moist dog food you smell ""dog food"".  When you open Newman's Chicken or Chicken & Turkey you smell meat.  It actually smells good.  Imagine that."
1,"My vet gave him a prescription diet which helped him tremendously but he HATED it and wouldn't eat it until he just couldn't stand being hungry any more.  With my vet's okay, I started mixing just a little of other types of canned food with the prescription but after a few days I could see he wasn't feeling well and his problems began to return.  Finally, I picked up a can of Newman's organic and mixed that with his prescription.  Not only did he like it, he was fine!  I can't give him this alone - he still must have the prescription - but as long as it is at least half the prescription mixed in, he can eat it every day and he is fine!  I was so happy!  And so was my little dog!"
1,"UPDATE:<br />The company determined that the product I received was defective in some way. They speculated it got too hot during storage or shipping. They replaced it for me at no charge. Everything is good. The replacement food is great.<br /><br />Here's my original review after a little editing, including further details of the resolution:<br /><br />I have been buying the ""Organic Liver for Dogs"" from my local store. The consistency (firmness and uniformity) of the product had been good. So I ordered a case of it from Amazon. When it arrived, I opened two cans immediately, excited to give my dog some more organic beef liver. However, both cans contained small pellets of something (liver?) and water. It was nothing at all like the same product that I have been purchasing locally, even though the label is the same and it is sold as the same product.<br /><br />I wasn't even sure if it was safe to feed it to my dog. The cans from Amazon are simply liquid plus a handful of pellets.<br /><br />As I look through the reviews now, I see there is a consistency problem with Newman's Own Organics pet foods. Some batches appear OK, but some are not edible (even by dogs). I sense a serious quality control problem.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow returns of this product. I opened two cans. Now I have the rest of the case that I'm afraid to feed to my dog. I can shake all the cans and hear that they are all liquid plus pellets (as opposed to the firm liver puree that was in the cans I purchased locally).<br /><br />UPDATE: I wrote the company and they quickly resolved the issue for me by sending me a new order at no cost. The new order has arrived now and the product is fine. It has the proper consistency. It looks exactly like the very good quality dog food that I was used to when I purchased this brand locally. So everything is resolved for me.<br /><br />I give the food itself a 5 star rating. Where else can one find certified organic beef liver for dogs in a convenient form and at a fair price? I think this product is the best available to me at this time, so it has to be rated 5 stars.<br />I give the customer service from Newman's Own Organics a 5 star rating as well.<br />I have a few reservations about quality control, based not only on my own experience, but on what I read in other reviews here. Fortunately, the company will stand behind its product and resolve any issues. Therefore, the lowest rating I could give for quality control would be 3 stars.<br />Overall, I think I would rate the product 4.5 stars. Since the customer service was so outstanding and the product is the best I have found of this type, I'll round up to 5 stars."
0,"We bought a case of 12 12 oz cans back in April. Just now opened the first can. Wow. Consistency of vomit, grayish tinge, and a vile odor. Opened a second can -- exactly the same. No way were we going to feed it to our dog. Something was clearly wrong.<br /><br />We've been buying Newman's Own dog food for the last two years (since we got a dog) and never experienced anything like this. Interesting to look back at the reviews here and see three from the April - May timeframe that sound like there may have been similar issues for others around the same time we made our purchase.  Guessing there must have been a production run that resulted in contaminated product. We've reported the issue to both Newman's Own and the FDA."
1,"My Pomeranian has a very sensitive digestive system and I could never find a food that I knew would provide him both great nutrition, taste and no allergic reaction.  Until this canned food ----- that is.  He loves it and it is made so well.  You can tell there are no fillers in it by the appearance and texture.  In fact, when you read the ingredients there is only Turkey Brown Rice and Vitamins.  I encourage anyone who is thinking about ordering this food to give it a try.  Your pooch will be glad you did."
1,I have an extremely fussy little Shih Tzu who won't eat dog food.  I discovered she will eat Newman's Own Turkey and Chicken formula of which I found 2 cans at a pet store.  After searching on line for a better supplier I discovered Amazon not only carries the food but would send me a case a month on an on-going basis.  The price is the best I found and I even get free shipping.  Every month I get an email allowng me to opt out of that month's supply if I wish.  I am happy and my dog is very happy.  I strongly recommend checking out Amazon's pet food.
1,"Unlike the other reviewer's dog, mine loves ""Newman's Own"" canned food.  I gotta believe that if a dog won't touch this, the dog is not only extremely fussy, but not very hungry as well.  Having this delivered to my door cheaper than I can buy it at my local supermarket sure is handy."
1,"After tiring of making my dog's food from scratch I looked for an all natural product.  Everything on the ingredients label of this canned food is recognizable as real food; no ""powdered protein"" or other questionable substances.  My dog loves it but to be honest I have to tell you that she practically inhales anything that she thinks might be food. I have the reassurance that this product won't hurt her.  The turkey and brown rice from Newman's Own is also excellent."
0,"My rescued GSD loves this Newman's Own; however, every time I feed this to her, every time she gets diarrhea. The first time I took her to a vet and after a few days of prescribed diet and med she got back normal. So I resumed her normal diet (this Newman's Own). Soon her diarrhea started to come back. I took no chance and immediately switched to home made boiled chicken and steam rice. After a few days her stools got much better. I gave this Newman's Own a last chance and... I just finished cleaning up my carpet.<br /><br />I have no idea of why there are so many good reviews. Is my dog just happened to be sensitive to this or I got a bad batch?"
1,"I love this dog food. I eat very well myself, being a vegetarian for over 20 years and try to eat organically as much as possible. I did a great deal of research on commercial dog foods and I was disgusted when I discovered the amount of chemicals and pesticides they contained. I tried my puppy on many different natural dog foods and she would have gas and the runs with every type, but Newman's Own.  So I am back to my first choice since she never had negative effects with it. Unfortunately it was a little hard to find locally, but now I can order it through Amazon and get it delivered every month. Thanks Newman's Own and thanks Amazon for making my puppy and I very happy :)"
1,My dogs have food allergies and I tried a holistic brand and they would not eat it. I tried the Newman's Own dry food and they loved it so I decided to add a little of the wet food. This food is not your standard wet food it looks more like mousse. It isn't a jelly loaf with yucky bits like some others. My dogs love it and lick their bowls clean.
1,"I am very pleased with the Newman's Own Organics products - my pups all agree that it is very tasty stuff!  Though my roommate has to leave the room every time I open the can (he is a wuss who makes a big deal about the smell!), you can tell just by looking at it that it includes many healthy ingredients. Take a look at the ingredient list and you can't help but be impressed!  Great taste, organic, healthy...it's just a great product!"
1,"I offered my lab mix his new DRY dog food yesterday. He refused it. It was one of the Newman's Own dry dog food. No matter what I did, telling him it was a treat, holding some of it in my hand, breaking some of the in two so he might get a bit of aroma from it, nothing worked!<br /><br />Then I read one of the previous reviews that talked about a dog or dogs having the same reaction until they mixed it with the canned food.<br /><br />I had also bought some of the canned food for my large, slow-eating, finicky eater, so I decided to try adding some of it to the dry food. I opened up the can, noticed that he was standing by me all of a sudden, mixed it in with the dry food, and gave it to him.<br /><br />Next thing I knew, the bowl was empty. But then I heard him licking the bowl, the bowl being drug all over the utility room floor!<br /><br />Now, a few minutes later, he is telling me in no uncertain terms, that he wants MORE!  That is an unusual reaction for him. He doesn't get more right now because he had quite a bit.<br /><br />I'm grinning all over because this worked out so well for him. He's an older dog with somewhat fragile teeth, and I'm glad he's happy.<br /><br />EDITED the next morning to say that he ate way too much and kept me awake all night because he needed to go out. I'll have to use better judgement for him than he is obviously able to use for himself regarding portion control. I should have added only enough of the canned food to give the dry food the taste he wanted. The whole can was WAY TOO MUCH for his system when combined with the amount of dry food he ate with it. Portion Control. I will have to keep reminding him, or in this case, I will have to make those decisions for him. He would never know when to stop if I left it up to him. EDITED weeks later to say that PORTION CONTROL has worked well. He really loves these little cans, better than treats, and he loves treats!"
1,"My pug was having skin problems and after 6 months a vet tech mentioned it might be chicken and corn that is giving her problems. So I began looking for something else that was organic and was pleased to find the beef and liver from Newman's Own. The liver was not her favorite and was a little strong smelling for this vegetarian, but the beef was great. She loves it, I steam some veggies and mix them in, then put a dry food on top and she scarfs it down. I do wish Newman's would put out an organic beef treat and a dry food that does not have chicken and corn but am very happy with the beef."
1,"My dogs love Newman's turkey and brown rice. I have been feeding it to them for about a year. I mix it with Flint River Ranch kibble so they have some crunchy food also. They are spaniels (a breed prone to allergies) and have had no allergy problems and have shiny, sleek coats. They are healthy and love the food. I strongly recommend it. It is a high-quality, human-grade dogfood."
1,"My little toy poodle had digestive problems a few months ago and just didn't want to eat dog food. All he wanted was cooked chicken breast, and so, that's what he got (so he'd at least get some food into him).<br /><br />Happened to find the Newman's Own canned chicken dog food, and he absolutely inhaled it! He finds it irresistible. I am so thankful this food is on the market -- it looks and smells like cooked chicken (which he likes), and has helped him get back on track nutritionally (which I like :-)"
1,"I've noticed a big difference in my dog's weight = she's able to maintain her weight, not gaining as much weight as when she ate dried dog food.  And being a white dog, she doesn't get dark teary eyes when she eats only Newman organic dog food.  I highly recommend it."
0,"I was not aware of and was not told the country of origin when I purchased a case of Newman's Own Organics Canned Dog Food..  This product is made in Uruguay not the USA!! It made both of my dogs sick with severe diarrhea.  Blue Buffalo was out of stock so I thought ""Newman's Own"" indicated it would be a good product made in the USA.  WRONG!!!"
0,"After reading the ingredients (and being familiar with Paul Newman's great-tasting salad dressings), I was excited about feeding this dog food to my older rescue doberman.<br /><br />I was surprised when I opened the first can because it truly looked like it had been eaten and passed through another dog's intestines.  Sorry to be so graphic but that's the truth.  It's hard to give my dog food that I dont even want to touch.  She loved the taste, though, and that was the important thing.<br /><br />That night, however, my poor dog was in agony and had black, watery diarrhea all over the house.  Twenty-four hours later she still wasnt feeling well.  I gave her Imodium and considered taking her to the vet.<br /><br />I'm happy for those dogs that like this food and dont suffer any side-effects.  I wish my dog were one of them."
1,"This is great, healthy food---the only food my dogs (Cav. Spaniel and Spaniel mix) can eat w/o stomach issues. Many other premium foods are just too rich!!  The dented can issue has never required me to return the food, but it happens too often and is very annoying!  I would never feed my dogs anything else and no one here carries this particular food, so I am very thankful that Amazon sells it."
1,"My pup loves this food and I love that it's organic and not bulked up with useless, unhealthy fillers. However, unless you're using the 'Subscribe & Save' feature, you're better off buying this at Walmart for $2.18 per can."
1,This is quality dog food and my 9 year old cocker spaniel loves it.  She has more energy and is more alert.  I give her half of a 5.5 ounce can each morning and the other half in the evening.  I also give her Newman's dry dog food twice a day. It's expensive but our darling pets deserve the best.
0,I found this food to be too rich for my 25 lb cockapoo.  It gave her really black tarry poop which im guessing is because the food is high in Iron.  I just didnt feel comfortable with the color of her stool.  It returned to normal as soon as I stopped giving it to her.  I think the liver content is too high for an every day food.  It might be ok to give 1-2 times a month but thats it.  I even mixed the food with fresh veggies.  It didnt work for us.
1,"My dog Annie has a health condition by the name of Megaesophagus,  anyone interested in learning about this can find information on the internet.  We had got to the point where we did not know what to feed her.<br /><br />Her regular dog food would get incapsulated in the slime, and she would vomit it all up including the slime. This food is high in protein and calories I add enough water to it and mix it well to where it passes through to her stomach.<br /><br />She has two meals a day  and thanks to finding this food I did not have to put her to sleep.  (Her condition had got that bad)"
1,"My dog loves this food and I don't have to worry about what's in it. With all of the bad dog food on the market, I'm glad there is a product like this one."
1,I have 2 rescue poodles which will eat just about anything that doesn't breathe.However I just don't feed them anything after a bitter lesson of my poodle Max dying from the China dogfood crisis.I will not feed them anything but totally USA made. They do like the chick/rice and I am about to give Turkey/rice a try.  I'm happy with it being mushy as easier for Spice to eat as she has only 1 tooth. I will continue to buy as long as they are happy with it.I'm so happy to have found it at Amazon with free shipping.
1,"I have two dogs.  One of them, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel has a very sensitive stomach and Newman's food is the only food that agrees with him.  Ordering from Amazon on a scheduled basis has made my life so much easier as I am a senior citrizen and UPS delivers the food free right to my door step.  Sammy loves the turkey & brown rice and chicken & brown rice with the dry food serving as ""treats"".  My Yorkie has an improved appetite since I changed to Newman's products."
1,"This is an excellent dog food. My dog just had IVD surgery and has been on the canned dog food - chicken and brown rice. Not only does my dog love it, but he does not have problems with his bowels (like he does on other canned 'wet' dog foods). His stools are still solid (although softer) and I can mix the food with water, since my dog is in need of more water in his diet. I love the product, although much pricier than other canned food, but well worth it. No problems whatsoever."
1,"Great organic dog food from a company I trust. My dog eats it happily and heartily. With the automatic delivery option, the pricing is the cheapest I have been able to find, both on line and in the stores. Definitely recommend."
1,I was looking to change my dog's canned food as he is getting on in years and I wanted a more nurtitious healthy brand than what I was currently using. My dog loves this food and eats it heartily. I feel better knowing he is eating an organic food from a company I trust...I would recommend it highly. I also signed up to receive automatic delivery which saves money. With that discount this is the least expensive pricing I have been able to find.
1,"I have been cooking for my dog since before the pet food scare, that gets to be too much at times when you have other things to do or aren't feeling well, I have been feeding the dry Newmans for 3 years but have a spoiled cocker who has to have a little 'something' in with her dry.....this canned food drives her crazy, she just loves it, must be the whitefish in. She gets a teaspoon or so in with her dry & cleans the bowl...Amazons price beats that big box store when you use subscribe & save."
1,"Hey, it's dog food but it's really healthy and our picky eater gobbles it up."
1,"First, I feed my dogs fresh raw food I make into patties and frez, each morning they eat one frozen,and I give them Fish oil, Garlic and Klamath shores Blue Green Algae caps. Then at night I give Newmans Chicken can food and mix in their Probiotic Miracle & Enzymes and Plaque off. Then they always have their dry food (Taste of the wild, grain free)anytime they are still hungery.<br /><br /> My 2 big dogs are very healthy at 8 years old, hardly get fleas anymore, I don't use chemical flea or heartwormer products anymore, as one dog had a bad reaction to them and lost most of his hair and had hot spots for two years. Then nat. path vet said my other vet should not have given him the yearly vacinations,which also caused the problems. He went on a 10 week detox after that.)<br /><br />For the alternative heartwormer I do 1 week each mo. I give my dogs Natures sunshine Artemisia Combination 2 in the morning, 1 at night with 1 BlackWalnut. then 2 times that week I will give them 1 HS2. I give these about 20 min. before I give them morning food. Then at night before bed. My dogs weights are 100 and 70. The dog that had allergey, I also would give him first thing in the morning, before eating, Transfer factor, or colostrum, also everyother day a kelp tablet, which I think helped the hair grow back in. I used emu oil with lavender oil and tea tree oil mixed in, on the hot spots. Also for the ears, I used Zymox, OTIC Enzymatic Solution. it worked great.<br /><br />Hope this info helps someone."
1,"I've been on the auto ship with this item for some time - I have a hard time finding it in our stores at times & when I do, it's always more expensive. I love the fact that this has natural ingredients made in the USA - My dogs are older - they need a simple diet & this fulfills all of our needs & it always shows up at the door when I need it."
1,"Our Schnoodle, Bella, is a very picky eater. Finally found something she likes which makes me happy because I try to buy Newman products whenever I can. I am impressed that their profits go to charity! This canned food is also healthy & good for her!"
0,"Price at Amazon entirely too expensive. Plus some of the canned dog food was hard, stale & my elk hound refused to eat it.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy again & I CANNOT recommend it to anyone."
0,"I did not post this under packaging review, because the order arrived fully sealed, no markings or damage to the outside box, but 8 out of the 12 cans were severly dented, so I had to assume they had been packaged that way.  They were even hard to open with the can opener.  I will still get my subscribed monthly order, but if it happens again I will probably cancel it.  I have no problems with the quality of the product, just very dissatisfied with the way it was mailed."
1,Newmans beef organic beef never fails.  My pooch (miniature poodle) never fails to gobble it up along with the premium kibbles I feed her.  She'll eat other canned foods but the Newman's is her first choice for dinner.
0,"At first, I thought my toy schnauzer had gotten into something that made her very sick but I took her off the Newman's Own anyway just to be safe (a decision made by my vet and I after I took her into the ER that night). I decided to try again a few days ago because it appears to be an excellent food (ingredient-wise) and we hadn't pinpointed the specific problem but, yet again, it wasn't even an hour before she was horribly sick and the effects of one feeding have lasted for days (Thank God I have medication left over from our last trip! I'm trying to avoid another vet visit but we're not in the clear yet). Even the stray cats on the block won't touch it and they pretty much eat anything. Definitely won't be trying it again."
1,"My Husky/Samoyed mix, The Lovely Marie, adores this food. As soon as I open a can, she starts dancing in circles. I think she especially loves the smell of it, although that occasionally puts me off a bit because it does contain fish. Some cans are stinkier than others, but it's all perfume to Marie's nose. She gobbles it up. I do vary her diet to include some grain-free products, but this is the food she gets most excited about.<br /><br />I love it because I trust this company, and I believe that Newman's Own products are of high quality. (I hope I'm right.) I also like their mission to bring good green and fair trade products to the market, and to use their profits to support charitable causes. Bottom line: I feel confident that I am giving my girl something wholesome and good.<br /><br />I stock up on this food because the chicken they put in it is ""human grade."" I hope the fish is ""human grade,"" too, because I have several cases of this in my garage. I'm thinking that when the ""Big One"" (earthquake) hits here in California, I'll just break out a case of this food and Marie and I can both survive on it until help arrives."
1,"After researching the ingredients on my dogs' old dog food (Beneful & Cesars),I wanted to get my pups on some healthier food and I also did not want to break the bank doing so. This turned out to be a great alternative that met all my nutritional and financial requirements I had set forth. For a well rounded nutritional meal, I mix the following <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK339Y"">Newman's Own Organics Chicken & Brown Rice Formula for Dogs, 12.7-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>,<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PMDYZA"">Newman's Own Organics 100% Organic Liver for Dogs, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK33C6"">Newman's Own Organics Adult Dog Food Formula, 7-Pound Bag</a>. The dogs really go nuts for this stuff and seem to enjoy it. It appears to me that the dogs have more energy and are in an overall better mood. One of Yorkies had a licking issue and that behavior has decreased dramatically since I made the switch to Newman's. It keeps their stool very solid as well. Overall this a great, nutritional meal at a good price......5 STARS!"
1,"My dog is 14 years old with many health problems. He is fussy about his food, but this is one that he will consistently eat. The whole Newman line is known for giving back to society, so I feel good about that as well."
1,"My german shepherd puppy loves this food.  It is very soft, so it mixes with her dry food easily.  The ingredients are fantastic so I know she is eating quality food."
1,"Newman's Own Organics Turkey and Chicken Formula is pretty expensive but well worth the price. Good ingredients, smells alright and looks good and best of all my very picky German Shepherd loves it."
1,"the dog would not touch it at first.  then icarried the case to the car to give it away.  dog came running and barking.  brought case inside the house again.  then he ate it and liked it ever since.  all meat, no grains."
1,We switched to Newman's Own when one of our dogs got very sick using a different popular brand.  My dog loves this food and her coat is now thick and full.  I particularly like the delivery which is next day in our area.  The price is reasonable and delivery is very convenient.
1,I feel good using this food. My schnauzer was having minor food allergies and I had trouble finding food without grains and by-products  The price was good and even better with the auto order and free shipping.  I live in a rural area that doesn't carry Paul Newman foods so door to door delivery was great.  Will use it again.
1,"I have 3 Yorkies , from 17lbs to 4lbs and my 4lb never gain any weight, we had them on the food from our Vet, I tried this dog food , they love it, and it looks like little one is gaining a little weight. We have been on this food for about 3 weeks now. Not a problem at all !"
1,"I have two Yorkies that are very picky eaters.  After a period of 2-3 days up to 2-3 weeks they will decide they don't like the food I am giving them and just stop eating.  I went through a real struggle when one of them got a stomach bug and got real sick with vomiting and diarrhea.  I started cooking fresh turkey with brown rice and his stomach healed up in no time.  But them I couldn't get them back onto dog food!!  I found the Newman's Organic Turkey and Brown Rice formula and they LOVE it.  I still give them a good quality dry food for little snack times.  However, they usually wait for their turkey and rice and gobble it up.  They have lots of energy and for the last two months have not gotten tired of the food.  I think we have found a keeper!"
1,"OK, I admit, if this hadn't been offered during an Amazon lightning deal I would not have bought it due to the high price.  However, this morning I opened a can to use for one of my dog's medicines.  Each of our three dogs got one-third of a can.<br /><br />And oh my, all three woofed it down and waited for more.  Even the cat chimed in and wanted some.  My dogs don't get this excited over canned Pedigree, which is what I usually feed them as a supplementary food source.<br /><br />Although the pureed liver comes out of the can looking and feeling like something that comes out of the back end of a dog, it doesn't smell offensive.  I'm just not used to these more organic ingredients:  liver, beef broth, minerals and vitamins.  This is definitely something I will buy more often for special meals.<br /><br />Interestingly, this product comes from Uruguay."
0,"I am not happy with the Organic Liver for dogs.  It is too mushy and should be mixed with dry food.  My two poodles won't touch it!  I gave the remaining cans to my son and his two dogs, labs."
1,"My sister was visiting with her 2 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels when my dog Jake, a Golden Retriever Mix, had an opportunity to ""sample"" their Newman's Own dog food while they weren't looking, He loved it; so I bought it at my local grocery store. Amazon's pricing, especially using the ""subscription"" is so much lower than the grocery store. I don't have to think about it, it just arrives every month."
1,"I trust this product and trust the company.  My dog does extremely well on both canned and dry.  No ""smelly"" digestive upsets!  I will continue to use Newman's Own extclusively for my senior dog pal.  Plus she seems to love it!  Her appetite says so anyway!"
1,"This is good dog food, but I stopped buying it, because one of my dogs (I have two) did not like it. She is not a big fan of can food in general."
1,My dog LOVES this food. He follows us around at meal time till he gets his food and then never leaves his dish till it's gone.
1,We have a toothless older small dog and this is perfect for him to eat since he licks his food and this is healthy for him too and cheaper than the canned foods at the vets and other places! So hard to find soft/canned food that our dogs like and our other dog has upset stomack troubles and with this she doesn't get sick if she eats late in the day and loves it. Our dogs are so picky too. This is great!
1,My dog was so tried of the Hill's WD he refused to eat it anymore.  Tried Newman's & he can't get enough!  Thanks for making a great product!
1,My dog LOVES this food. I have spent hours researching healthy dog food and my vet recommended Newman's Own. I had her on a freeze dried raw food diet which was just horrible on my pooch's tummy and my vet warned of the dangers of a raw food diet (she has seen kidney failure in dogs) - thank goodness I switch food.  My dog is a picky eater and this food she keeps on loving.
1,"Alert:  In the event your dog is allergic to fish, be aware that the third ingredient in Newman's Own Organic Chicken and Brown Rice Formula canned pet food for dogs, after ""Organic Chicken"" and ""Sufficient Water for Processing,"" is ""Ocean Whitefish."""
1,"We have been using this for a while with our 5 Bichons and it's great.  Organic, looks and smells fine, no stomach problems, delivered free, great price at Amazon.  You can't go wrong!"
1,"My two dogs love this product , and it is all organic .All of Newman's dog foods are good for your dog .Give them a try .Keep them in good health ."
0,"My dogs have not been too hard to please with food.  They will eat almost anything, but they have little interest in the 3 cases of this stuff I bought.  Maybe I should add something to it like salt?"
1,"I bought a case just to try out on my wiener dog, Oscar.  He has lost weight.  Now he is much more energetic and can jump higher which means he can get into more trouble.  Before going up stairs was slow and sometimes I had to wait. Now he is the first up the stairs just like the old days.  Keeping weight off of Dachshunds is very important for their back.  It costs a little more but I think I will make it up in vet bills and also have my buddy around for a longer period.<br />Doesn't have that dog food smell and you can actually see the ingredients."
1,"My family rescued a pug mix from a shelter a couple months ago.  We used the puppy food they gave us and then matched the brand at our local store later.  A couple months went by, wouldn't say our dog didn't like her cheap dog food, but she did develop demodex and a whole new world about dogs and health opened up to us.  Bottom line, we were feeding her, but our vet compared it to us eating spaghettios every day for every meal for life.<br /><br />Demodex is not contagious but inherited and a skin disorder we had to treat.  We talked to our vet about her immune system and how we would want to keep her as healthy as possible during treatment and after.  While he didn't really recommend any particular brand, he did encourage us to educate ourselves about what's out there.<br /><br />After some research and with the idea that we buy Newman's Own brand foods for our human selves, we ordered the dry kibble and mixed it with the active dog and puppy formula canned food they make as well.  Our dog does love this food, and clearly prefers the canned to the her old cheap foil top square packages we'd pick up each grocery visit.  We have noticed that her fur, while always been soft, has become thick and buttery soft when you pet her.<br /><br />I know the vet warned us that the treatment might have adverse effects, but she has been fine.  I credit a healthier diet for getting her through this.  And it clearly has done wonders for her skin and coat.  Added bonus, the food actually smells good with minimal odor as opposed to the cheapy stuff which made me gaggy."
1,This is an excellent product and my dog is thriving on it.  It is healthy and no filler.  I also like the convenience of having it delivered to the house and I don't have to carry it.
1,This is the only food that my Golden eats as soon as I put it out for him.
1,We have a picky dog and this is the only food he will eat. Thanks
1,"I feed my dog nothing but Newman's products.  Before I got her from a bunch of college kids she had subsisted on cheap dog food and cheap fast food.  Did she wolf down the Newman's the first time I gave it to her? No.  Just like us, it took time to retrain her palate and appreciate the lack of salt and msg, artificial flavors and colors, and to relearn better eating habits.  Two years down the road, she is allergy free, healthy, energetic and has a beautiful coat.<br />Highly recommended."
1,"I have this on automatic shipping once a month.  It's great to have a case of dog food on hand to jazz up the kibble.  We board labs and goldens in our home so sometimes dogs need a little something extra to make the food special enough to eat.  This does the trick.  And it's a high quality canned dog food too.  Far better than carting a case or even 1/2 dozen cans from the supermarket.  Love having it shipped right to my door, having it discounted and no shipping charge through Subscribe and Save.  Great service!"
1,Both my puppy and I like the canned dog food. I like the ingredients and can even see the carrots when I open the can.
0,"I was very excited to find this product, having really enjoyed Newman's Own products in the past and coming to trust them.  I am also a firm believer in feeding the best grain free diet to my Labs, and 95% organic beef went well with that.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the product is disgusting.  The consistency of what comes out of the can is disturbing.  Try to imagine dried out peanut butter that is impossible to separate or spread.  No amount of water that I added would allow me to use a fork (and knife) to try to separate the product and mix it with my dry kibble.<br /><br />Instead, I am trying the new Castor & Pollux Organix Grain Free product, and hoping for the best.<br />[...]"
0,We got our Canned Beef from Amazon around last summer but opened it just now.  It smells vile.  No way we are giving it our dogs.  Not sure if this a variation or do they always smell that bad.  Definitely deleting it from the Subscribe and Save list.
1,"I used to buy on-line from a pet store and pay very high shipping charges.  Now I get it automatically once a month with ""no"" shipping charges.  You just can't beat this from Amazon!! 5 stars"
0,"OK, for those that think they may be buying a grain free product, DON'T BUY THIS.  My yellow lab is bad with any grains and causes her to have asthma attacks (really, really bad attacks).  Tried this first time last night and she woke up coughing and wheezing.  WTF I thought and sure enough, it has oat bran in it.  My stupid dumb ***, I trust Newman's to have a product accurately reflecting the products on the label.  Brown rice and chicken aren't oats.  I guess my lesson learned is trust no one and read all the labels (actually did before i bought, must have missed it though). I didn't miss it,but Amazon has proven they are wonderful when it comes to taking care of their customers if they feel there was an error or communication problem.  I will continue to use Amazon for most of my shopping, given the incredible value of unlimited 2 day shipping for $75/year"
0,"We bought a carton of Paul Newman's brand because of the raves your on your website. Louie, who will eat almost anything, turned away from this meal in disgust. We gave away the rest of the cans."
1,"The ingredients seem good quality, although nothing is recognizable in the can, like with Merrick.  It's great for mixing with kibble to moisten it and if your dog needs mush--soft wet, canned food."
0,"I love Newman's products, but my dog hated it.  We purchased a case hoping to feed our dog something that doesn't contain all of the artificial chemicals, but he wanted nothing to do with it!  If you like organic, support Newman's products.  Hopefully your dog will like it better."
1,the best thing about a dog is that they will just eat anything that they see ... dog does not complain ...
0,"just received a case of 12 chicken & brown rice formula...every single can was dented beyond use...this was a problem before and supposedly amazon was to get their shipping problem with this item corrected...it states that this item is not returnable although damaged, i wrote to amazon requesting a return label and credit ...will see what happens...i want to return the case of food so they can see the damage, there were 4 air pillows in the box but they had holes torn in them so they were flat and just laying on top of the food...ordered this product from another website while waiting for amazon to straighten out their shipping problem, the other company sent the order UPS and the case of food was surrounded by the Styrofoam pellets and not a dent one !...UPDATE... Amazon replace order, came UPS this time instead of USPS, air pillows were again torn and flat, but only one can barely dented,...Also, i opened one of the dented cans from the first order, bad smell and food was pulled away from the sides, so take care with dented cans of dog/cat food"
1,"I am a ramen lover and have tried hundreds of varieties over the years, including my time in Japan, the land of endless ramen varieties. Nong Shim (Korean) is a long-time favorite and among the top 3 makers on my list. Their noodles are heartier and more delicious than everybody else's, mostly because they use better ingredients. The texture is firmer and more elastic, even retaining their chewy mouth-feel over time, unlike other noodles that quickly become mushy. If you're used to bargain basement brands like the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00061I6UE"">NISSIN TOP RAMEN</a>, do yourself a favor and try a Nong Shim.<br /><br />Among the higher quality ingredients that Nong Shim puts in here are ginger and shrimp extracts, beef and pork bone stock, and beef tallow. Beef tallow is the same stuff that makes McDonald's french fries so tasty.<br /><br />Pros<br />+ very tasty, spicy, and filling<br />+ excellent texture to vegetable seasoning pack (dried cabbage, carrots, onions, mushroom). I can actually taste the veggie bits.<br />+ 0mg cholesterol and no trans-fats<br /><br />Cons<br />- 500 calories in 1 pack. 160 of which are fat calories<br />- 40% of your daily saturated fat intake<br />- EXTREMELY SALTY: 94% of your daily sodium intake if you drink the soup<br /><br />Despite directions for boiling the noodles for 3 minutes, it can be prepared with just boiling water and a bowl. I made some with hot water from the office Flavia machine (coffee and tea maker) and waited 5 minutes.<br /><br />Because of the very high sodium and fat content, instant ramen should not be eaten often. But in a pinch (either due to lack of time, money, cooking skills, or all 3), ramen can provide a quick and filling meal. It is very easy to add vegetables and leftovers to it to mitigate the saltiness and provide better nutritional value. Ramen alone is just calories, fat, and salt and offers little nutrition. The powder packet packs a punch, and half a pack or less is sufficient for full flavor and to reduce the sodium level.<br /><br />Canned corn can be added (a popular topping in Japan), soft boiled egg, shredded green or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001I02JBY"">Chinese/Nappa cabbage</a> or other vegetables, kimchi, spring onions, boiled shrimp or fish fillet, or whatever you like. The soup packet can also be used to make a pot of spicy soup, as you would use a soup mix or bouillon cube.<br /><br />Instant ramen is unhealthy, because they are fried in palm oil or some other fat, then dried and packaged. But if you're going to eat something bad for you, might as well have it be delicious, and this Nong Shim variety is among the best.<br /><br />Product made in CA."
1,i'm surprised reading the 2 reviews saying there's no kimchi but the box of kimchi noodles i ordered does have bits of kimchi but they're small and few. I've tried quite a number of instant noodles but this is the ONLY one that i actually would finish the broth. the other brands i just ate the noodles.
1,"Love the al dente texture and wonderful soup mix.  Not too spicy, do not expect to find pieces of kimchi though, just the wonderful flavor.  Good portion.  Definitely beats other brands of ""instant noodles""."
1,"These noodles are actually edible in the sense that they are not anything like the overly spicy bowl equivalent.  The Kimchi bowls are way too hot for me.  These ramen packs are perfect. Some spice, but I am able to drink the broth using the entire packet.  I am glad I found these inexpensive snacks that are not too hot.<br /><br />I also like the Beef and Ginger bowls, those are not spicy at all."
1,"These noodles are far superior to the ones sold at my local grocery store. The noodles taste fuller and have a richer texture, the seasoning does not taste like food coloring, and the dried veggies pouch is awesome.<br /><br />The only modification I do, when having me some Ramyun, is a cracked egg. Once the noodles get soft enough to where I can break the block and stir them around a bit, I crack an egg straight in the pot. I give the egg about 20 seconds so it can coagulate just slightly, and then I gently stir it in the noodles for another minute or so.<br /><br />I love having nothing to eat at the house, because I have Ramyun noodles."
1,"First of all, it tastes great. I've had the Shin Ramyun, Neoguri, and Chapagetti from Nong Shim, and this Kimchi Noodle Ramyun outdoes them all. The spiciness is JUST right, the saltiness is at a good level, the flavor is rich and full, the noodles are firm and have good texture... and best of all, it's easy to make in a microwave. Just throw in a microwave bowl, add water, and microwave for 7 minutes or so (don't take my word for the time... it depends on your microwave).<br />I've lived in Japan most my life (Japan is the paradise of instant noodles... I REALLY know my instant noodles), and ever since I moved to America recently, I've been craving for GOOD instant noodles (not the cheap, crummy stuff in styrofoam cups like Maruchan...). This satisfied my craving.<br />The sodium and oil and whatever are bad for you. Of course. It's instant noodles. Deal with it :D"
1,"I used to eat brands like Nissin and Maruchan, but then I found this in my local grocery store, and I love it! The broth is thick, hearty, and spicy, and the veggie bits give it a more authentic taste. The only problem is the sodium content, but virtually every instant ramen has too much sodium."
1,"Best Ramen Hands Down!!! The noodles are bigger and have better flavor and the broth has such better flavoring than Top Ramen and Maruchan. They are pricier but if you're eating ramen by itself as a meal, this is the way to go. If you're just boiling noodles for stir fry or whatever, you can get away with other brands. The Kimchi flavor is by far the best. I tried this brand/flavor when it was on sale on a whim not knowing if it would be good or not and boy was I surprised.<br /><br />The noodles come in a brick that is circular! No more breaking up square bricks to fit in small pans! They come with a seasoning packet and a vegetable packet which is nice. You definitely don't need the entire seasoning packet...in fact you can get by with HALF of it without it tasting too weak, but greatly reducing your sodium intake. They are on the spicy side but so is Kimchi(cabbage rubbed in chili powder and pickled).<br /><br />If you just want to try a single bowl or foil package try your local asian grocer or sometimes my local wally-world carries the Styrofoam bowls in the Kimchi flavor around a buck."
1,My favorite noodles. I recommend adding an egg during the last minute of boiling. delicious!
1,"This is my favorite instant noodle so yummy. I always boil it as whenever I microwave it, it tends to come out too undercooked."
1,"This ramen is a nice departure from standard supermarket fare.  They have a very nice spicy heat, not overpowering, very flavorful.  The noodle texture is firmer than supermarket ramen, a pleasant improvement."
1,"l like this noodle's taste ! of course l am really used to this type of noodle flavor.<br />l came from South korea where usually called ""The paradise of instant noodle"" .. l mean at least for me ..^^;<br />l missed Kimchi flavor SOOOOOO MUCH !!!<br />Now l finally got this lovely 20 Package !!! l am so exited !<br />My sister in law also loved it ."
1,"This is a favorite of mine, mainly because I like the flavor and I think the noodles hold up better than most.  It is not health food, too much sodium and fat, so if that is what you are after look else where.  If you want something a bit unique in the ramen world this is it.  I love the flavor and the unique spiceyness of this soup.  It develops a nice burn at the back of your throat somewhat like a hot and sour soup, but a different flavor.  It has the noodles, a small packet of dried kimchi bits, and a packet of flavoring.  Like all ramens I have seen, not much more than noodles and flavoring so it never hurts to throw in your own touches while cooking, like an egg to thicken the broth, or some shrimp and veggies to complete it."
1,This is the best instant noodle I've ever tried. I like to cook it with some vegetable.
1,"One of the best ramen I've tried, spicy and it comes with a seaweed packet unlike many of the ramen you find in grocery stores.  Very high in sodium, I dump the broth after eating the noodles and veggies."
1,"This is the Cadillac of the instant ramen soups- without a doubt. The noodles used by Nongshim are quality, thick, and provide decent bite. The instant soup component is flavorful, spicy, and tastes like a real broth- no artificial business here. Kimchi flavor is limited and slight, but the included bits of freeze-dried cabbage give the impression that an attempt was made.<br /><br />As noted by other reviewers, the sodium is through the roof in this and other instant noodles soups. Though delicious, slurp down a bowl full of soup broth at your own peril.<br /><br />As for preparation, I've found that cooking only requires adding hot water from an office water dispenser. Have not needed to use a microwave."
1,"Any instant isn't as good as the real thing, but for instant, Nongshim makes a decent group of instant noodles. This is probably the best kimchi instant noodles out there. Avoid Paldo; that is total garbage. Add an egg to this to really add some flavor, but be warned, it may make the soup a little bland. Add a tiny bit of kimchi juice to it, to spice it up.REMEMBER!!! do NOT overcook the noodles. It is disgusting if you overcook the noodles. The noodles cook in the hot broth anyway, so turn off stove early on, and don't add too much water of you will get bland soup. And don't let soup evaporate too much, or you will get salty soup. It's all about balance. :) good luck!<br /><br />UPDATE: YUP, you gotta microwave it! otherwise, it's gross. I know, you smarties are probably laughing your donkeys off. :) I've revised it to 5 stars. It's pretty good. But let it cool off for 3 mins. you'll burn your mouth off, if you try it while 'hot'. soup is spot on. noodles are pretty decent!"
1,"Essentially, this seems to taste very similar to the Spicy Picante variety but doesn't pack a massive kick. So, if you want the milder version I'd say this is right up your alley. Granted there is still some spice but it's toned way down."
1,"this one is not as HOT as the others, but its real good too.  I meant to order another kind, but accidently order this (my fault) and I'm glad I did."
1,"Yes they have 520 cal per pouch and yes there are 160 cal from fat, 40g of carbs and 1220mg of sodium all things that should be consumed in moderation.  However, for me it is a quick easy meal and covers one meal a day.  I actually prefer the picante ones better but these are a good change-up.  Deployed it is nice to have something tasty I can eat in just a few minutes and the calories and fat can be burnt off in no time"
1,"i was very surprised by these noodles, if you like spicy food and want something to take off the winter edge then get these. very easy to make to."
0,"Let me start with a few things. I love Nong Shim's Shin Ramyun. I am also a big fan of kimchi. So I thought what could be a better combination than that? So I ordered a case of these from amazon during the back to school sale. I must say I was very disappointed. First of all the noodles are more of the traditional ramen noodle, not the thicker type you get with the Shin Ramyun. (So disappointment #1) Then the flavor of this was not good at all, it wasn't like adding kimchi to a bowl of the Shin Ramyun stuff at all. To be honest the flavor was quite off putting. Now I have a case of these noodles I have no idea what to do with."
1,"I always get a kick out of the reconstituted veggies growth :)<br /><br />The base is chili-flavored more than anything.  The veggies/napa has a hint of the kimchi acidity.  The noodle is Nong Shim's normal brick, which is pretty good.<br /><br />I eat this with kimchi from a jar, and it's pretty good that way, too - a few pieces of cabbage dropped into the soup with the noodle after the water's been added, adds a bit more heat and just the right acidity for breakfast (someone out there is going 'Eew, gross!')<br /><br />Getting this by the case from Amazon saves me a trip to the local Oriental market, which is a bit out of the way and saves me a Saturday afternoon, a rare and precious commodity.  Thanks!"
0,"Disappointed this time. Actually I have tried several other Nong Shim Noodles like Chajiang Noodle, and before I got this one, I was really impressed by the texture of their noodles. This Kimchi Noodle, I have to say, is not typical Nong Shim Noodle, a totally different texture, lack of elasticity and nothing better than any other brands."
1,"I've tried the regular spicy picante version and the spicy seafood udon style. The three of these taste pretty similar in many respects, all with spicy, red sodium-loaded broths and hearty noodles. Where this one differs is the presence of tiny pieces of ""kimchi"" in the dried veggie pack- they're no bigger than the size of a fingernail, so don't expect actual chunks of kimchi in this. The flavor is nice, comparable to the others, and I enjoy it; sodium is about 94% DV per pack"
0,"i like spicy food, but the jeat is so overpowering, it burns your taste buds and takes away all the background flavors."
0,"The Nongshim Kimchi noodle I ordered on Amazon is the worst I've ever had. I used to buy those from Korean grocery. For these Kimchi noodle I got from grocery, there is a small bag of kimchi included. BUT for this product on Amazon, there is no kimchi at all. I hate this product."
1,"These noodles are a great alternative to standard chow mein noodles.  They are smaller and crunchier.  I love them on salads, in soups, as a topping to rice pilaf and tofu scrambler.  They also make a great snack food."
1,"Purchased online, when our local store quite carrying.  Excellent noodles.  Good price.  Yummy.  Even though you have to purchase a case--it's worth it."
1,"We have been cooking Asian cuisine for many years.  These rice noodles are the very thin, crunchy noodles that do not detract from the stir fry ingredients by being thick and and almost taking over the dish.  These noodles have been available in grocers for years but as of the past two years are slowly disappearing from the shelves.  Now only the fat, thick noodles are for sale.  Each can of noodles will serve two people.  The noodles will keep for months and months on the shelf so don't be concerned about buying 12 cans."
1,"I can't say I ate these personally, but my 82 year old mother was so thrilled to get these. We can't find them in the stores anymore so we thought they weren't being made any more. Isn't that always the way it goes-you find something you really love, and they stop making it. Thank you  Amazon for helping me make an old lady happy."
0,I don't have to eat these to know it isn't good for those with wheat allergies or corn allergies. Bleached enriched WHEAT flour should not be in RICE noodles. Neither should modified corn starch. So if you have gluten allergies or are allergic to the most genetically modified plant on the earth - corn - then I highly suggest you steer clear from this!
0,Love Jelly Belly.<br /><br />However my bag came with a nice hair in it.  When I called the company to complain they told me they weren't in charge of packaging and gave me a long distance number for another country to deal with.<br /><br />Not impressed by item.
1,This is a very good eggplant dip. I am from the middle east and we make this at home. It is so close to home made. the only thing I like to add to this is a little more Garlic and it is perfect.<br />Spread on pitta bread  and enjoy.
1,"This tastes surprisingly good for something that comes out of a can. However, there is a bit too much ""citric acid"" in it, as it does have that slightly sour flavor. Also, you have to watch out for the seeds because they are present in the mix. I'm going to try making this as the directions state (sans more lemon juice). This goes really great with pitas."
1,I'm hooked on Lebanese food so I will keep this on hand for those times when the local deli is closed or it's too cold- or hot- to go out!!! Add some minced garlic and olive oil and the quality is good.
1,"No, it's not better than the stuff made by your Lebanese friends' grandmother; but it's really, really good.  And you can just pull the top off and eat the contents with whatever bread, crackers or veggies you have.  You don't have to doctor it.  You can if you want to, but it's not necessary.  You can also use it as a base to make other dips; as a sandwich spread; to make a dressing for salads/vegetables; to form croquettes or stuffing of leftovers in vegetables; as a stir fry sauce; and for other things.  It's there for you if you come home late starving and need to eat something NOW, but you can also make it fancy to serve at parties.  It tastes good at room temperature straight from the cupboard, or chilled from the frig, or heated.  I've never met anyone who disliked baba ghannouge, which makes it a good thing to keep on hand for unexpected guests.  People of all ages like it, so it's good for taking to potlucks and picnics etc.  Besides all that, it's very nutritious, satisfying, and easy on your system.<br /><br />I have been gratefully using this product, along with the company's canned hummus, for many years.  To me, this is one of those genius products that is just always there for you, like peanut butter.<br /><br />I will add that, technically, both this and the company's canned hummus are produced with the idea that you will probably tweak it a little to your taste for the standard use.  The standard for that would be:  Olive oil, lemon juice, salt (possibly); and perhaps some paprika or a little hot sauce.  My Lebanese friends instructed me to also add extra tahini to canned hummus.  I agree this can be nice but I don't always bother.  If you keep a jar of tahini on hand for that and other uses such as stirfry, then great; but you probably don't need to bother buying it just for this.  Note that the flavor of real olive oil does highlight baba ghannouge and hummus, so you want to try to use that.  This is trickier than it seems, because many ""olive oil"" products are not really olive oil (sunflower oil is a common replacement).  There is a lot of fraud in the olive oil industry for some reason.  Anyway - just mentioning that, because you'll enjoy these two dips much more if you have real olive oil."
1,"This is a really good dip for vegetables and pita.  The only ingredients are eggplant, tahini paste, and salt, so it is pretty natural and basic.  I took it to work and popped the can, which is highly convenient for travel since you don't need an opener.  It tasted fine, but kind of bland.  There's a bit of a smoky flavor.  I mixed in some olive oil, lemon juice, and garlic like the can says to do (if I only I would read directions first) and its really good.  I agree from the other reviewer that the consisency is quite think like hummus, but it is not made out of chickpeas.  It isn't the same as the babaganoush I get at restaurants, but it is still good for a can product.  I'm a big fan of eggplant if made properly.  You also get alot for the price, I can make four meals out of this.  I will definately buy again.  I also bought the hummus from Alwadi."
1,Very good dip. It does need a little doctoring up and garlic and freshly ground pepper help a lot. I don't think you need to add any lemon as it's tangy enough. It makes for a very nice snack or light meal with bread and fresh cheese. I love eggplants but I don't always have the time or inclination to roast them. It's a treat to be able to pop a can when I want convenience and it's great to save pennies on the bulk purchase with prime delivery.
1,"We love our homemade babaganoush but it takes a while to prepare and the local eggplants don't always look great. So last month when time was particularly tight I decided to try alwadi babaganoush. We had used their tahini and found it excellent.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I07884"">Alwadi Al Akhdar Baba Ghannouge, Eggplant Dip, 12.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />But still, canned babaganoush? How good could that possibly be any good?<br /><br />One big question was how they flavored it. How would their balance of tahini, lemon, oil, herbs and spices turn out to be? Well, it was only 12 small cans, and if I didn't like it my husband would probably still eat it.<br /><br />Another question for me was whether it would contain ingredients I can't eat as a gluten-free person. Fortunately Amazon let me see the ingredients list, and there's nothing in there I would put in in my own kitchen - pretty amazing for today's prepared foods.<br /><br />When it came, we tested it right away by having some for lunch. We ate it with rice crackers. Wow, the taste was great. In fact, the taste was just like homemade. This product is going to stay on my subscription list at Amazon.<br /><br />That little can lasted for two meals for the two of us eating all we wanted. I'm delighted with this product, another alwadi success, and recommend it to anyone who loves eggplant."
0,"This has the texture and the looks of hummus.<br />It is made of eggplant, but this is not Baba Ghannouge.<br />I've had Baba Ghannouge from Alwadi Al Akhdar and Cortas before.<br /><br />This is eggplant hummus."
0,"Cans are labeled as a babaganouge but it is more like hummus. I think they are mislabeled. If you wanted hummus they are OK. You can add some olive oil, garlic and lemon juice ending with a decent hummus."
1,I saw this product featured in an episode of Oprah and it seemed the entire audience loved it.  Finally I had the chance to try it for Valentine's Day with my fiance.  I love it and would definitely buy it again.
1,"I ordered this after a friend told me how good it was.  I didn't think I would get it before Christmas since I ordered on 12/18/06, and had it shipped by supersaver.  But I was pleasantly surprised to receive it by 12/22/06.  This is the best chocolate drink I've ever had - I highly recommend it"
1,Wonderful product!  Too delicious for words.  I will order this again and again!
1,"These are high-value treats.  My dogs highly value their deliciousness (even my picky cattle dog).  I highly value how easy they are to carry.  These treats aren't crumbly, yet are easy to break apart, and don't get your hands dirty.  I use them mostly on off-leash walks with my two dogs, to reinforce recalls -- especially useful for my newer adoptee, who's only been with me 9 months.  I can take one bacon man out of my fanny pack and carry it in my hand while hiking, then split it between the two dogs when they race back to me, for instant reinforcement -- no digging in pockets or fumbling with baggies, but instead instant reward (half a man each is plenty!).  And my hands stay clean!  These bacon/cheese men are now my go-to treats for training on the go."
1,"These treats are awesome and so is the company.  They respond immediately to any questions or issues that you may have about any of their products and stand behind them 100%.  My three dogs are very picky when it comes to treats but these they love.  I break up the little gingerbread men and use them for our obedience training.  I would highly recommend them to anyone especially if you dog is like mine and does not like peanut butter, carob or any other type gourmet flavors."
1,"It was a five star for me, but I don't know that it will be for others.<br /><br />My rescue White Husky/Samoyed mix, Hope, absolutely LOVES these treats. The flavor must be fantastic to her senses. She can smell them from the other side of the house! Just opening the package brings her running.<br /><br />When I first got her from the shelter, at age 9, she had been badly mistreated and was very ill with heartworm. She was sick and frightened, and didn't have much of an appetite. She just picked at her food. She would nibble a couple of these and then retreat. I took her through the heartworm treatment protocol, which was 4+ months long, very painful, and scary for both of us, not to mention extremely expensive. (Fortunately, the rescue group paid for the heartworm treatment.) Luckily, I wasn't working outside the home at that time. I had to be inside the house with her 24/7. She could not go outside except to poop and to pee. That was it. Nothing could elevate her heart rate. It was my job to make sure it didn't.<br /><br />As she began to feel better, she wanted more treats. These are tiny (around 1"" square) and really not appropriate for a large dog, but she loved them so. After a while, when Hope felt better, we moved on to Newman's Own Organic Dog Treats. I now buy them in bulk from Amazon (good price). I still have some Buddy Biscuits, and if I want her to be an ""especially good girl"" I'll break them out. She will do anything for them.<br /><br />My girl has found her forever home where she is now happy, healthy and well-cared for. At 66 lbs. she has had extensive (read: expensive) dental work, enough to set her new adoptive mom back a few months in expenses.  But we'll eventually be fine with that, and she can crunch those harder treats now.<br /><br />The Buddy Biscuits were a step for us. She found them soft and delicious. Her teeth were painful, but the scent of those treats was so enticing. They may or may not be just right for your small dog. I'd recommend buying one package and trying it out first.<br /><br />And please, if you have a dog, be sure it's on some kind of heartworm preventive treatment. Prevention is so much less expensive than treatment in terms of money, pain, worry, and care!!!<br /><br />Heartworm is passed by mosquitoes. One bite from an infected mosquito can do it. My friend said, ""My dogs fur is so thick that a mosquito can't bite her."" My vet said, ""They bite inside the ear."" No one is safe."
1,"Cloud Star, Soft & Chewy Buddy Biscuits Dog Treats, Bacon and Cheese Flavor, 6-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 4) I have to buy these bulk my dog loves them so much!  He's 14, so his teeth are weak.  These are soft and chewy, just like the name says!  Good buy for older dogs."
1,"We have a little dog and these treats are great! We really have to watch what we feed our pet now days. I had a Schnauzer who was was diabetic and for the last three years of her life we had to give her shots twice a day. We have talked quit a lot to our vet about feeding dogs. We love these treats they are great for small dogs and easy to chew. But the best part is there is no corn,soy,artificial colors,artificial flavors or byproducts. They also don't have several other ingredients that are bad for your pets health. And the other great thing something make in the good old USA."
0,"When I purchased these treats in our local health food store previously, they were soft and chewy and perfect for me to squish my dog's morning and evening pill into. The ones I bought from Amazon are dry and crumbly and don't work at all for giving pills. I bought all flavors, and all seem to be the same. So now I have bags and bags of treats that are no good at all for the purpose I intended. My dog still eats them, but certainly NOT with as much gusto as the ones I bought locally."
1,"They are great, and my little puppy loves them. They are so soft, and they smell good...even to me!!.LOL..will<br />order more after she finished these up."
1,"I use this treat as a reward for getting on the grooming table.  My three dogs ""line up"" when I pick up the grooming brush.  What a treat!"
1,These are awesome for training..just the right texture and size.  I break them in half and my dog will do anything I ask to get one. The chicken flavor is great too.
1,"My dog LOVES these.  They are easy to break apart, cheaper than at my local store, and better for him too!  My order was very soft, not dry like some other reviewers so it must depend on the age and storage.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
1,"I used these when training only and the dogs loved them.  I cut each piece into about 4-5 little pieces.  If you don't use them up though, make sure you store them in a sealed bag or container as they will get hard fast."
0,"I bought several bags of first colony organic coffee in the end of May, 2011 but they send me the coffee's expiration date in AUG., 2011"
1,"I first had this coffee while visiting my sister in PA.  She makes her coffee one cup at a time with the #2 filters in the one-cup filter holders.  I loved it so much I brought back two bags in my luggage and then found the filter holder on line from Melita.  Sadly, I ran out of this coffee but was thrilled when I found it on Amazon."
0,"I was very excited to try these products with my toddler. Unfortunately, he does not like them one bit. I expected them to be more fluffy, like a muffin, but they are more like a quiche, as they are made with egg. I'm hoping if I keep trying them he'll like them, but I'm thinking this is the first and last time I'll order this product."
0,"I adopted a dog recently from a rescue organization - a pit bull/mastiff 3 year old - who came to me fat, happy and with an overall positive outlook on life, regardless of the fact that his owners had left him to rot in an abandoned apartment building.<br /><br />Being a first time dog owner, I put him on this food because it came recommended to me by my local pet store in Austin, TX and it was the cheapest quality dog food (by weight) there.  The dog ate this food for about three weeks and every single time I put it out in a bowl, he would devour it right away.  He eats really fast and this food does not cause him to choke or spit the food back up - although now, three weeks later, I almost wish he had.<br /><br />In about two weeks time, I began to notice patches of fur gone in his coat and LOADS of shedding everywhere in my small apartment.  I was using the Furminator to shed him about twice a week and one time, I drew blood.  He was also scratching and licking himself raw.  Within three weeks, his collar had gotten too big for him - meaning, of course, rampant weight loss.  That was it: I brought him to the vet and they told me it was hard to tell because he's a rescue and their medical histories are difficult to conclude - so, it could either just be the change of weather from summer to fall or it could be his food or it could be that he is just stressed out from shifting environments and owners.  I switched his food anyways, because I was tired of the fur and felt sorry for him, even though he loved the taste of Canidae.  Within a week, the shedding stopped and he stopped scratching.<br /><br />I dug up some reviews online about Canidae and the opinions seem pretty mixed.  Either people's dogs love it and do incredibly well on it or it causes extreme negative reactions, anything from nausea and vomiting to allergies, which is ironic considering it is grain-free.  After all the digging, I personally conclude that it is because Canidae changes their formula periodically and their quality, although rated highly in terms of their ingredients, is inconsistent because of their processing methods: as in, nobody seems to be quite sure where they process their ingredients and when they do change their formula, whether this change affects that process.<br /><br />Its such a shame because it is a bang for your buck and my dog loved the taste of it.  I just wish Canidae would be more transparent about their process and maybe tell their consumers why there are such polarized reactions by dogs when they consume this food.  Overall, it was definitely a learning experience.  For me, the food rates at 2 (not a 1, because the price is great for the quality of ingredients) since my particular dog's reaction was negative."
1,"These aren't the full sized version of the candy, or the miniature version, but an intermediate size which still works in a candy bowl.  They arrived very fresh, and very quickly.  Delicious."
1,"Tootsie Rolls are one of the most historical candies that store well and are individually wrapped for clean serving -- and are low in fat compared to anything else resembling chocolate.  I love Tootsie Rolls so much that I bought my grandson a small amount of stock in the company.  The background information for this candy is very interesting and a worthwhile read.  I am never without an ample supply, and it's my favorite comfort food."
1,"These were great. They were soft and very fresh. These were possibly the freshest tootsie rolls that I have ever had. This seems to be the only way to get the long thin size as well. We liked them so much, that I have ordered more."
1,"God these are/were so good! they were only $10 and change when i bought them. at $2ish per pound it's a great buy. at $4ish a pound i can go without. But if you don't mind the price_ they were really, really good. fresh. Well packaged. Timely arrival. and lots of them."
1,"I LOVE Coffee, but for health reasons,decided to kick the habit.  I stumbled upon the the Teeccino Herbal Coffee (Medium roast- Hazelnut flavor), and found that I am in heaven.  It DOES NOT taste exactly like coffee, but can easily be used as a substitute.  I added brown sugar and Bailey's brand of Irish Creamer to it, and thoroughly enjoyed every sip.  I did not mix it with any regular coffee whatsoever, but instead decided to just try a cup of the product alone.  I must say, it is very DELICIOUS.  I am looking forward to trying some of the other flavors.  What I like even more about it, is that it is made with herbs and nuts; you can hardly go wrong with that!"
1,"Served on it's own, like straight black coffee, it's great.  However, I wouldn't recommend adding creamer, milk, sugar, etc., whatever you would normally add, as it tends to take Away from the taste.  If you really have to have a sweetener of some kind, try a hazelnut creamer, as it helps make it palatable to those who need a little sweet with their coffee."
1,"I have tried Teeccino Hazelnut and , while it does not taste much like coffee, it is a great morning hot beverage. I use 2 tablespoons and make on mug of the brew and use some maple syrup sweetner. Yum.<br />Many develop allergy to coffee and not just to caffeine but to some of the 300 other compounds in regular coffee. Beware of this."
0,"I read the good reviews on Teeccino java herbal coffee so I went to my local Whole Foods to purchase it.  They only had Teeccino original light roast herbal coffee.  I thought I'd try it anyway.  I wasn't expecting it to taste like coffee.  I was just looking for a hot beverage without caffeine, that tasted good.  I can't find the words to describe the awful flavor.  I made my daughter try it too to help describe the flavor.  She said ""it smells like plastic"".  I wasted my money buying this product!!"
0,"Google ""propylene glycol"" to find out why.  I bought this product, along with several others, without running the ingredients by my wife first (a nurse of 30 years) she<br />was surprised when she noticed it.. we went a googling, and poured my $50 order down the drain afterwards.  There's ""pure"" and then there's ""not so much"".....<br /><br />from the website:  [...]<br /><br />Propylene Glycol<br /><br />A cosmetic form of mineral oil found in automatic brake and hydraulic fluid and industrial antifreeze.

1,"I ordered this product when I couldn't find it at any of the local stores. I have small dogs wirh continual teeth issues. Since I've been using the mini bites, I haven't needed to have their teeth cleaned at rhe Vet's! And they love the taste. WIN, WIN!"
1,I came across this bag of jackfruit and had to try it. Really tasty! Not quite 'juicy fruit' (as I've read it described) but like a pleasant blend of every fruit I like. Chewy but not tough.
1,"I purchased these herbes de Provence for a gift bag.  Cooking with these herbes is heavenly, and the beautiful Provençal fabric is a cool little reminder of the South of France."
1,"When I open the package I was overwhelmingly excited at the deep earthy aroma that came, I could not believe I had just bought a pound of trifles for this price when I have paid 10th times the price for so much less.  I will definitely buy aging for that reason alone.<br />However I could not award them 5 stars because though the small grand their flavor dose not follow through.  Though for the price could we expect them to live up to their Italian counterparts?<br />The answer sadly is no"
0,I cannot locate the expiration date on any bottles or did I miss it? Can this honey be last forever? It should have an expiration date. Every food items has it.
1,"I signed up for the subscription and received my 4 bottles for only $11.77 with free shipping. With a subscription you can choose to reorder in 1,2,3, or 6 month intervals and cancel at any time. Ordering this way saves 15% plus free shipping. I ordered on the weekend and received my package in 5 days with the box and contents in very good condition.<br /><br />The honey is exactly as described by the company. While it is unfiltered it is strained, which the company does state. So, if you're looking for honey with pieces of honey comb and such this honey is not for you. The important thing is that they heat the honey at a lower temperature which preserves the enzymes (destroyed in supermarket type honey). Side by side comparison to store bought honey there are notable differences. It is darker than store bought honey (the darker the better), the taste is quite different, as well as a more natural texture.<br /><br />So, if you are looking for a healthy honey without the pieces of stuff in it I highly recommend this honey!!!!!"
1,"I love this honey mainly for the packaging.  The bottle is super easy to use -it doesn't leak & the material is easier to squeeze compared to other containers.  You can even use the suction from squeezing it to pull the last drip of honey back into the nozzle. Perfect for keeping your bottle from getting sticky with unwanted/unseen drips.<br /><br />The taste is nice -It's perfect in my hot tea and it's also good plainly spread on toast.<br /><br />I see another commenter complained that they had a problem with it crystallizing, but the bottle description explains that this may happen due to the raw & unfiltered nature of the honey. The bottle also tells how you can easily reliquify by heating in a warm water bath.<br /><br />I highly recommend this honey!"
1,This Ambrosia honey has a mild spicy sweet taste that reminds me of cinnamon sugar.  I've tried it with hot biscuits and butter and think it would be great in oatmeal or with french toast.  A perfect compliment to the breakfast table and the price is incredible (cheaper than the local honey's available) along with being an American made product.
1,Excellent tasting honey. It has to go into my top 3 favorites (the other two being apple blossom and sourwood). It has an alluring note of cinnamon mixed in there somewhere with all of the sweet flower nectar. I'n not too crazy about the spout on the bottle however. It doesn't seem airtight.
1,"I've been trying several different types of raw honey over the past few months, and this one is now my favorite. I love that although it is raw and unfiltered - it still has the consistency of regular honey, so it is very versatile. There is also a hint of a spice flavor like cinnamon that makes it even yummier. It is the one I keep going back to for almost everything.<br />Susan"
1,"I first tried this honey in a small mom and pop diner in Montrose Colorado. I came away from that diner with 2 bottles. That was 1996. I've been buying this honey long distance ever since. It does not have the after taste of regular honey, tastes richer, thicker, etc. etc. Only honey I will buy. Except for the HIGH Altitude Honey this company also sells. It is absolutely the most flavorful honey in the world, although more expensive. But worth every penny."
1,"I read the previous reviews and was pretty shocked at the great feedback people had for this honey. After going out on a limb and ordering this I decided to try it myself.<br /><br />First - the packaging. The plastic bottle itself is a bit cumbersome - sometimes I have give it an iron grip squeeze in order to get the honey out. It does really give off that ""hometown raw"" aesthetic though.<br /><br />Second - the consistency & color. My wife and I prefer raw honey and have tried various other brands (whole foods, farmers markets) and usually the consistency of the other brands is an extremely thick goo, which you have to spoon out. What's refreshing about this honey is how smooth it is. Another thing with the other brands of raw honey is the color. The other brands I've tried have a dark amber color (resembles apple butter almost), however, this honey although slightly darker than regular grocery store bought honey, it still has a fairly normal color. My guess for the lighter color is attributed to the raw purity of this kind of honey.<br /><br />Third - and lastly the taste. This is the primary reason why I give this honey five stars. Although as I mentioned the packaging is a bit cumbersome, I'd eat this honey if it came in a bowling ball. Well, maybe not, but you get the point. The taste is what matters. This honey is hands down the tastiest honey I've ever had in my entire life. It's sweet but not overbearing and no bitter aftertaste like other honeys I've tried. You MUST try this honey at least once in your life. It's refreshing to know that I no longer need to look anymore for great honey - I'm a customer for life."
1,"I grew up on the Western Slope of Colorado and know exactly where this honey comes from since my mom used to take me to the fields to get honey comb when I was a kid. For me, it not only brings back fond memories, but I am so happy to have great honey again! I live in AZ now and the honey not only tastes funky but it sugars very quickly. Since the only sweetener I use is honey I am particular about the flavor; not only that, but this even smells like the flowers from whose nectar it is made. I've got it on subscription which makes it ridiculously inexpensive."
1,"On the strength of the reviews for this, I decided to give Ambrosia Honey a shot. It's a gamble buying honey, having never tasted it.<br /><br />Luckily, this honey exceeded my expectations. I normally buy locally-produced honey at twice the cost. The depth of flavor is much better with this honey. It's hard to describe, but the flavor is both complex and light. If you're used to cheap grocery store honey, Ambrosia Honey will be a real treat.<br /><br />The price for this 4-pack is what pushes this honey to five-stars. It's an incredible value, considering what good honey costs.<br /><br />The dispensers are well sealed, and it would be difficult, if not impossible, for these to leak in transit."
1,"This honey is very good, but I had a problem with the top. I had to finally cut the tip off with a scissors, to be able to squeeze out the honey! Now, I am using that same top on the new bottles, which helps a lot. The honey, itself, has a very nice aroma and flavor."
1,"This honey has a nice taste. But despite what the label says, I don't believe it is either raw or unfiltered. It has the clarity and consistency of garden variety honey found at any grocery chain.<br /><br />The plastic bottles do not seal adequately for shipping -- one of the 4 bottles in my shipment was lost due to leakage."
1,"Ambrosia Pure Honey is delicious and, unlike most honey available at the grocery store, this honey is produced in the USA.<br /><br />My only complaint about this honey is that it comes in a bottle that is very inconvenient to use.  The main drawback is that there's nowhere for the honey to come out of the bottle unless you unscrew the whole cap and pour the honey out of the bottle.  If you want to be able to squirt honey out of the bottle's nozzle, you need to make a hole in it yourself.  This is no easy feat because the bottle cap is made of hard plastic that can't really be cut with scissors.  I usually end up pouring this honey into a different bottle in order to be able to use it more easily."
1,"I love the honey and the price is right, I think.  The bottles are large and come in a 4-pack which I like.  Both my husband and I use honey in our coffee every morning.  When I purchased this honey I was looking for a darker kind than what I can find here in Western North Carolina. True, there are darker honeys available on Amazon, but most I looked at were rather expensive.  My only complaint about this honey is that it's a little messy when pouring because it does not stop cleanly and I usually have to just clamp the top down on it to stop it.  Not a big deal, really.  I just make sure to wipe the bottle off before I store it back in the cabinet."
1,"Grocery store honey, with very few exceptions, is all I'm used to.<br /><br />I gave this product a try based on other's comments and found it to be very, very good.  It's thicker and more flavorful than what most are used to buying at the grocery store, and it doesn't leave one with an unpleasant aftertaste.<br /><br />This will probably be the only honey I'll be consuming in the forseeable future.<br /><br />(a few months later)<br /><br />The plastic bottles this honey comes in are not very reliable, the last shipment had one leak out (came home to a box full of ants) and the quality of the honey I received in the summer was very different form what I had bought in the winter."
1,"This honey is the best there is! We're in the Army so we travel alot, but being originally from Colorado I have always loved this honey, I just cant find it anywhere. So I was thrilled that Amazon sold it in bulk. Now I stock up on this honey because the flavor is so good, I have never tasted better honey. Also Amazon does a great job at shipping the honey, never recieved a broken bottle of honey and the honey has always been a perfect consistency, never hard or crystalized."
1,"This arrived in perfect condition.  It's hands down the best tasting honey I've ever had.  I use honey to sweeten everything and have tried a lot of different ones.  This is my favorite!<br />The bottles are the size of the little bears...perfect for squeezing into my coffee, tea, pancakes, etc!"
1,"Delicious honey!  It is hard to find a raw, unfiltered honey that tastes this good, and the price is great!  If you use honey regularly, I recommend the subscribe and save option for this product, you will not be disappointed."
1,"I don't usually care for honey, but I love this Ambrosia Pure Honey From Colorado's Western Slope.  It is sweet, but doesn't have that overpowering ""honey"" taste.  It's hard to describe, but I do love it.  Also, I can't take sweets too well, as they make me nauseous, but I can have this honey on my buckwheat cereal and feel just fine. I've already ordered another 4 pack."
1,"Very good Honey, at the price I paid for the 4-pack I will most certainly buy again. If you are a fan of pancakes or waffles try them with Honey instead of syrup! Did you know it is also a Natural pain reliever as well? Do the research. Enjoy!"
1,This brand has its own distinct taste from other honeys. This is in my top three choices of honeys to use. Great price for the size and count. This is a good alternative for sugar and syrup.
1,"I try to support anything USA made and especially businesses that are ""doing the right thing."" IMHO this honey has so special flavor or texture, in fact it crystallizes even when stored unopened. But I like the fact that it supports bee populations in a healthy locale. With the plight of the declining bee as it struggles to survive we need environments such as this to ensure the bee and our agriculture systems survive. So for that reason and since it is raw and unfiltered, I will continue to buy this product. Other honeys you may want to try that are sold on AMZN are Cal's Tupelo raw honey made in GA (incredibly good and smooth), and outside of the US consider Manuka Honey from New Zealand (amazing health benefits) and my very favorite is Bernard Michaud 1000 Flower Honey from the South of France. It is very expensive but truly heavenly and worth the price as a special treat. I use this one solely on toast or pastries or by the spoonful.  At Tropical Traditions I buy their Canadian organic raw and unfiltered honey that in order to be somewhat cost effective, I buy it in a 15# pail that lasts a year. I use honey mainly during the fall and winter for constant tea sweetening (yes. I gain a few pounds) but I rationalize it's healthier than organic sugar and it supports bee farmers."
1,This is very famous honey in Korean community.You can believe this product for the reliability. My family likes this honey a lot.Thank you so much for this product in amazon.
1,"Great natural honey with clean, bright taste.  Doesn't have the chemical taste of store bought honey.  Not too sweet.. The packaging is easy to use.  Lid seals properly and doesn't drip.  Great on homemade breads."
1,"I received my item(s) damaged (2 of the 4 bottles seals were not air tight,and caused them to leak)<br /><br />After reading the reviews, I noticed a few other customers had the same problem with leakage.<br />I think Amazon should attach a second seal to prevent the bottles from leaking during shipping.<br /><br />I called Amazon, and they fixed the problem! The only thing that sucks is, I have to wait a month until the order ships!!! (I think they have to wait for a shipment from their supplier?)<br /><br />At least I got to keep the damaged order to hold me over until the replacement comes!"
1,"This honey is the best I have ever tasted, and very affordable!<br />I am so glad I purchased this!<br />These are the small bottles, but there are larger bottles available."
1,"I was hoping for some reason that this being unfiltered honey, I would get an extra boost of energy or feel some kind of benefit. Didn't get anything like that, but it still taste really good, can't really tell the difference between store bought, but the smell is pretty noticeable. Not a bad or strong smell just a different smell. I have this on a subscribe and save plan, and will try other honey products from this company. Shipping was prompt and bottles were in great condition."
1,"This honey tastes great, has the perfect texture and is very healthy for you.  I ordered the case of four and one of the lids came off during shipping, spilling honey all over the inside of the box (nobody's fault, really).  I called Amazon and they ""made it right"".  Gotta love their customer service (and the honey).<br /><br />I wish I could order more without the long wait... :("
1,"I ordered two 3-gallon jugs of honey to cook with for the Specific Carbohydrate Diet.  I received four 16oz. bottles of raw Ambrosia Colorado honey.  It's great.  I haven't tasted good, natural honey like this in years.  I'll reorder, it's going fast."
1,Sourwood is my fav honey but this is a very close 2nd.  Good price too!
1,"I have already tried before different kinds of honey that I bought from grocery stores but there is no honey that can compare to Ambrosia honey, the taste is so pure, not so sweet,I use it everyday for my smoothie drink and with almost anything. I don't use white sugar anymore as they are made from chemicals. I first purchased this at vitamin shoppe but I found the best price here at Amazon.com. I love...love...love the taste and I am already hooked...try it yourself, you will like it too...."
1,When I was a kid I hated honey. Primarily because my mom always bought the stuff in the Bear. It always tasted like plastic too me. Fast forward 15 years and I am living in Colorado. I bought this on a whim one day just to see if there was a difference between the expensive (moderately) and the cheap stuff. All I can say is this is one of the finest tasting things I have ever put in my mouth. With my first container I found myself sneaking spoonfuls of nothing but honey for the first 2 months. Now I am content to add a teaspoon full to my Earl Grey every morning and anytime I have biscuits or need a tiny bit of sweet.<br /><br />Simply amazing! Can't say enough good things about it.<br /><br />Oh oddly enough my tabby likes a little bit now and again as well.
1,best honey ever but 1st u need to drain it n another jar.<br />when i squeezed the honey out the bottle cap burst off & honey flew everywhere!!
1,"What happened?!?!  I just signed on here to get more and it's saying unavailable. NOOOOO!<br />I kept forgetting to pick up honey at the grocery store so one night when I was making my tea and realized I was completely out I turned to amazon.  This was priced close to store honey so I thought I would give it a try.  SO happy I did.  If they ever get it back in stock, this will be the only honey I buy.  I've recommended it to all my family and friends.  Taste is great, high quality, full of flavor.  Bottles could be a little better, but they arrived in perfect condition.  If you love honey, you HAVE to try this!"
1,"I haven't been too terribly pleased with the store bought honey I purchased, so I decided to check out Amazon for a tasty alternative. I purchased this particular honey based on the excellent reviews and terrific price. Sure you have to buy in bulk, but that's well worth it. This is honestly one of the best honeys I've ever tried. I'm thrilled with this purchase!"
1,"I think it s the best honey ever.<br />whenever I bake bread, add this honey.<br />This is a number 1 honey to me.<br />Tasty!!!"
1,"Good testing honey. The description claims that they do not overheat it, if it is true then it is great product for the price."
1,I use it for my tea everyday.  Very good flavor and excellent price.  Very fast shipping and great packaging.  Order yours today.
1,"Much better honey than the stuff that comes in the little bear at the supermarket, and it's very inexpensive! The packaging is a little bit annoying, you have to cut off the tip of the spout but it's such thick plastic you need to use cutters or a very heavy pair of scissors, but it's also sealed with a foil seal which help prevents contamination during shipping."
1,"You don't need a lot of words to review this honey...it tastes better, is healthier and less expensive than store bought honey.  As usual, Amazon service was great too.<br /><br />(And btw, the containers are fine.  Strong enough and were not leaking a drop when I opened the box)"
1,"I am very pleased with both the quality and price of this honey. With subscribe and save, this is cheaper than the honey at Costco."
1,"This honey is so smooth and delicious. Floral and sweet with a beautiful amber color, it goes wonderfully with my hot tea."
1,"This honey has been consistently a perfect ""5"" for over a year since we started the automatic deliveries every 3 months. The honey is the color of the picture and not cloudy at all. It has a very nice mild flavor. We use it daily. I gave some as Christmas gifts this year to introduce others to it and they loved it. Since I depleted our supply, I ordered an extra shipment and it was sent immediately. Do yourself a favor: sign up for the auto-ship option to save some $ and time! This honey will not disappoint you! Perfect!"
1,"I had this shipped to me overseas from the States and I'm thrilled with it! It's delicious, and just the perfect taste and consistency for my afternoon tea!"
1,"This honey has an amazing taste and a natural, luxurious texture. Its color is dark and its flavor has a mild cinnamon-like undertone. It does great with my favorite green tea and makes an average slice of bread delectable!<br /><br />The packaging is good as well. It doesn't leak and preserves the honey's freshness for long after opening the bottle. I haven't had to clean the sides of the containers like I used to with commercial honey because these bottles don't drip as much.<br /><br />Another reviewer noted the honey crystallizes, but the company tells you how to avoid and solve the problem directly on the package. I almost hoped the honey would crystallize a bit, I love eating a little spoonful of honey with bits of crystals in it...<br /><br />I live in Colorado but I will continue to order this honey from Amazon, as the local honeys available from my grocers aren't quite as good as Ambrosia's. I recommend this product."
1,"I use minimum 4 teaspoons of honey everyday and since I had not tried Mountain Honey before I bought this hoping this was it.<br />While I don't know if this is indeed pure Mountain Honey, I can tell you that this is better than the only other brand in the market that I had been using until now.<br /><br />I found both of them to be good quality honey, but this one is better. This one is less processed (which is a good thing) which I detected from the taste and viscosity. It is more viscous and only mildly sweet- just like how real honey should be.<br />I punched the same size hole as the one in the market honey bottle and I had to press hard to squeeze this out of the bottle while market honey would start flowing the moment I tilted. (I accounted for bottle size, weight etc.)<br /><br />Regarding problems with punching holes (mentioned in earlier reviews), I have a small pair of steel scissors that just fits in my palm and it was a cinch to punch a hole with that. Alternatively you can use a thumbtack or a nail.<br />Please don't try to cut the top.<br /><br />Regarding the bottle itself, while I do like the ""Punch-your-own-hole"" approach and the cap to close the hole securely , I don't like the fact that the entire top doesn't screw tight around the bottle. Some honey can flow out and stick on the sides. But that's neither much honey, nor does it happen often so its not a big problem.<br /><br />This may be slightly expensive than the honey in the market but I think its worth it."
1,My honey arrived yesterday with no leakage. The honey tastes great! It doesn't have that acidic aftertaste that the honey at my local supermarket does. The price is very competative as well.
1,"helping my Grandfather tend to the bee hives that he maintained for the Apple/Peach and Pear Orchards on the Mohawk Trail in Western Mass.<br /><br />the taste is excellent - the packaging very good - the spout top better than the 'Honey Bear' head to pour from as well as wipe clean.<br /><br />off to try on some McCann's Irish Oatmeal - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E3SU"">McCANN'S Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal, Quick & Easy, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />4 min in deep bowl in Microwave - Berries in bottom if desired - or even canned drained fruits/ Peaches - Pears<br /><br />Topping with Honey and Whip Cream a perfect comfort food on a nasty winter day.<br />Even as bedtime snack - as will not upset stomach"
1,"This is wonderful honey.  Four pounds of Ambrosia honey arrived today  in square 16-ounce plastic bottles with tight seals.  ...no leaks of any kind.  Which is good because the honey arrived in the same box as our order for ocean fish canned catfood.  But  due to  excellent  packaging, all the flavors are wonderful, distinct and separate. (Our cats approved the catfood, we really welcomed the Ambrosia honey.)<br />Seriously, this honey is a natural and life-sustaining product, credit where credit is due. I tried some right after it arrived today; I had no joint pain after eating this honey, which means to me it is natural and doesn't contain  corn syrup or high fructose corn syrup, a chemical additive to some other brands of honey these days, they tell me.  I am grateful for no joint pain, no corn.  Pure honey.<br /> Other reviews  have told you about gentle handling of the product, and that any crystallizing (solidifying) is normal and reversible in a bath of warm water.<br /> So let me concentrate on what a terrific,  necessary product this honey is in your kitchen cupboard  and your emergency supplies.  Honey, peanut butter, and dry milk (or protein powder like MLO)  mixed together make a terrific emergency food.<br />Proportions are as follows:1/4 cup honey<br />  1/3 cup peanut butter<br />  1/2 cup dry milk or protein powder ,\\<br />Mix together into stiff dough that you can separate into bars or into 1-inch balls. (Many variations of this on recipe websites, if you want to look for them)<br /> Keeps in fridge, but during a power outage this mix will be so popular and useful, it won't need to be stored, just more of it made.<br />This is an old Adelle Davis nutritional recipe, credit where credit is due, and in addition this homemade food resembles to a degree a French-manufactured product called Plumpy'nut successfully used by UNICEF to help severely malnourished children.  (more about this on the Web, if you want to know more.)<br />Finally, for your emergency kit, a small amount of honey will help close a scrape or wound, and start it healing.  So many uses for this helpful product from the honeybees.  You can't lose but will win many times over with this Ambrosia natural honey."
1,"Bought this honey and my family uses it for everything, toast, tea, coffee, peanut butter/honey. Has a good flavor, would recommend"
1,Ambrosia continues to put out the best honey at a very reasonable price. We have ordered this honey many times and it never fails to disappoint.
1,I like it very much. it is really worthy. the quality is so good. and the price is very reasonable.
1,"i had have a pretty handful experiences with honey and most honey i bought is disappointing. I saw this product on amazon and decide that let's give it a try. It is very exciting for me because this is ""real"". That means it's not made by sugar but come from a natural resource. I highly recommand this honey to everyone, good honey is worth your money."
1,"HOPE THEY KEEP IT IN STOCK, SEEMS WHEN THERE'S SOMETHING GOOD IT'S ALL GONE NEXT TIME YOU ORDER."
1,"Ambrosia honey is a good product.  It got here fast, and I am quite happy with my purchase."
1,This is definitely some of the best honey I've consumed. So far the product is used primarily as a sweetener for teas.<br /><br />Would and have recommended it to a friend.
1,"I'm not a connoisseur, but I like this honey. It's a bit sweeter than I prefer, but I like the flavor. I use it mainly in tea and can just adjust the amount I use. The color is rich and it has good viscosity. The 16 oz (weight) bottle is just the right size to keep at work."
1,"Ambrosia is a fabulous honey - strong, distinct flavor - for a virtuous price.  Best deal around for raw honey!"
1,"I subscribed this product on June, and now I only have one bottle left. I love this brand of honey, and I use it everyday for everything. I use it to give peach iced tea more flavor, or use it for smoothie and many many things. Most importantly the quality is so good, but the price is so affordable. Much better than the honey I can get from supermarket."
1,"My DSL died in mid-post so forgive me if this is a duplicate review.<br /><br />First, I'd like to say that in the past I've been very critical of Amazon's packing jobs.  But this time, the product was packaged expertly.  Thank you.<br /><br />A few years ago, I used to get fresh honey from a farmer/beekeeper close to a large metro area.  Like this honey, his honey was pure and unfiltered raw honey - and it tasted great.  So, to beat the taste of his honey, this honey had a high bar to overcome.  And, it did.  When I opened up one of the bottles, I squirted a bit on my tongue for a taste test.  And when I tasted it, I thought I'd just died and gone to Heaven.  This honey wasn't just great, it was incredibly superb.  I guess the difference between the farmer's honey and this honey must be the Colorado wildflowers.  And, they did make all the difference.<br /><br />This will be a ""must buy"" item in the future and I might even do it by ""subscription.""  Besides using it in my coffee instead of aspartame (yuck) or sugar, I'm going to keep one bottle on my office desk.  And whenever I get a bad-tasting mouth, I'll just squirt my problem away (grin)."
1,This honey is delicious!  It has good flavor.  We are repeat customers.  The honey did not crystalize through the duration of the two of us using 4 bottles.
1,"This honey was some of best damn honey I ever used. Naturally, I'll be ordering more in the near future. Tastes so good, you can drink it out the bottle."
1,This is excellent honey with a delicate flavor suited to many uses.  I like it in hot tea or simply drizzled on fruit or cereal.  It definitely beats the usual products from most grocery stores.
1,"You will be very pleased with this honey.  It is so very delicious.  No disappointment with this honey, you will enjoy!"
1,"I had no idea honey tasted this good.  I had been looking for a healthy alternative to cane sugar and artificial sweeteners for my tea, so I purchased a 16 oz jar of honey from the grocery store for $15.  This Ambrosia honey makes the grocery store brand look like garbage.  It has a very sweet taste to it, almost like apple pie filling, whereas the grocery store brand was somewhat tangy/sour.  This costs 1/4 of the price too...<br /><br />Will definitely buy again when I run out."
1,This is the best honey I've ever bought. It tastes just like the one my grandma used to have when I was a kid. It's not cheap but worth every penny. The taste is great plus it's not imported.
1,The honey tastes great and you can't beat the price.  It's cheaper than the so called honey that is sold in supermarkets.
1,"This is good honey flows easy has a slight cinnamon flavor clear and so far has not crystallized at all, I'm almost done with bottle two. I enjoy a teaspoon full in my tea."
1,"Good luck finding a lower price on natural honey! I've bought this 4-pack several times with Amazon's subscribe & save deal. I use honey in my tea and recipes, and I make mead with it. This one has a vaguely spicy, but still delicate flavor. The only thing I can think to compare it to is cinnamon but it's much more subtle. Very delicious. The bottles are nothing special, kind of thin, and I have to saw the top off to get the honey to come out easily, but don't let that stop you from buying some! I urge anyone to try this honey if you're looking for natural, healthy honey, or if you want to get away from the filtered mass-marketed honey that is often smuggled illegally into the U.S."
1,"Excellent honey. It's filtered and heated but not enough to kill the enzymes in it. I'll definitely buy it again and again :)<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO616S"">Ambrosia Pure Honey From Colorado's Western Slope, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)</a>"
1,Doesn't really resemble wildflower. Has the tartness and pungency of regular old clover honey. Much prefer the same company's other offering in the 23 ounce bottle.
1,This honey is sweet without the over-powering flavor of clover honey.  The price is right & I get a package delivered every month. (I signed up for the subscription service.)  This is great since I drink tea and go through one bottle a week.
1,"I did find this so tasty like many people here, but it's just basic honey. It's great for a honey made by hummingbirds. It's rather expensive for what you get, you also have to ""poke"" out a hole in the plastic tip, which is hard if you don't have a point knife. So far I've put it on toast and in tea. Very great tasting and fresh."
1,"This is very good honey. Rich, creamy, with a floral flavor. You almost get the flavor of honeycomb with out the waxy feel in your mouth. Some honey tastes strong, this honey just has a lot of flavor. I bought this to put in my tea but so far I have just been enjoying it plain."
1,We love this honey.  Great flavor.  Arrived quickly and it great condition.  I like that it isn't overly processed.  Would buy this again.
1,"Title says it all.  After reading an article regarding how virtually all of the honey bought in grocery and big box stores has all of the honey filtered out (short of the organic, etc), we decided to expand our horizons and are glad we did.<br /><br />This honey is wonderful.  It's darker than our store bought counterpart and really has a more complex flavor profile also.  My parents were up recently and we had this out to finish off our pizza crust with and they couldn't stop raving about it either.  Guess I just gave this company a new customer."
1,"very sweet!!<br />it's got four packs in one go, and leak-free cap. Me and my family enjoyed the flavour, and the texture. I'd recommend this product to friends and neighbours."
1,Previously purchased organic honey from WF which we liked.  Wanted to try this highly rated raw honey and found it to have a very mild taste.  Will switch to Ambrosia  ;o)  Also 4 bottles were very well packed and not a single drop was lost in the shipment to Hawaii.
1,"I'm only on my first bottle but in just a short time I'm almost through it already.  I use it for my morning latte.  It s very good and I like the convenience of it being pourable, although I don't know how they make a raw honey pourable.  If it's the real, genuine article, I'm very happy to have found it.  I signed up for the automatic shipments every 6 months."
1,My wife's been using this brand of honey in her tea for at least two months now.She likes it better than what we've been buying at our local store.I really like the fact that it's a product of the good ole USA.I have nothing against India mind you but...and have no issues with Amazon transactions
1,"This is actually very Good Honey, Will order again in the Future When Stock runs Lower Recommend to everyone who ever Likes the sweet Taste"
1,"This honey is delicious and well worth the price. The taste is just on the right side between too dark and too light. I have so far eaten this honey on toast, in tea, on a bagel(went very well with cream cheese)and with peanut butter. Everyone who has tried has commented that it has a slightly spicy taste as if the bees had used cinnamon nectar to make the honey. I will be ordering this one again. I only gave it four stars because it is not a local honey but where I live that can be hard to find so I guess you make do with what you can."
0,I thought the honey was much thinner than any other honey I've gotten and It didn't have much flavor.  Even my kids didn't care for it.  Good price though and I like the bottles the honey came in.
1,"You get 4 small bottles of tasty honey here.  I was expecting to get bigger bottles.  I am looking for the best deals when I purchase online, and to be honest I can get a similar price to this at a local supermarket for a bottle of honey.  So I probably would not buy this again.  The honey is tasty and I like it, but if you are not saving any money why go through the process of ordering online. Unless of course this is some sort of special honey you cant get locally, but thats your call."
0,"This is NOT the same honey, as contained in the 23 oz. bottles I've ordered in the past. MUCH lighter in color and RUNNIER!<br />I immediately cancelled my 'sub/save'...WHY DO THINGS HAVE TO CHANGE...FOR THE WORST?!"
0,"I own a bread machine and use honey for my whole wheat loaves.  This product works great for a few weeks, but then something happens to the honey.  It gets thicker.  (And this was in bottles that were sealed and unopened).  This resulted in my bread not mixing properly.  The dough would get clumpy and would not blend together properly.  I had to throw out half of the honey."
0,"I just opened my second can of this and for the second time there was no pot roast in braised beef pot roast soup.  It contains mostly broth with a few vegetables.  It's best suited for a vegetarian doesn't like vegetables.  Seriously, I suppose Campbell's might be having problems with their mixing equipment, but I won't be buying it again."
1,"I bought the first one at the Las Vegas Bellagio hotel, the price tag on it was over $18. All that you have to do is add hot water. I have put them in my desk drawer and brief case and used them in my coffee to make wonderfully flavored mochas in the morning or afternoon for a pick-me-up. Of course, as cocoa they are outstanding with just water."
0,"This stuff is tasty but caveat emptor: it's glorified non-dairy creamer, which is the first ingredient. Enjoy this with artificially flavored vanilla sandwich cookies."
1,"top class chips, and can't find outlets on East Coast.  Will reorder again soon.<br />you can't beat this Boulder Canyon chip!!!"
1,"Curry has become one of my favorite foods over the past year.  We've always struggled to make good curry at home as the grocery store curry pastes don't have very much flavor.  I always found myself having to use an entire jar instead of the 1Tbsp that they tell you to use.<br /><br />A friend of ours recommended we try this brand.  It had AWESOME flavor but ended up being a tad too spicy for our taste.  I'm not sure we'll purchase it again.  If we do we now know to not use quite as much.<br /><br />We've really been enjoying the Mae Ploy brand of curry pastes which can be found here on Amazon as well.<br /><br />If you like your green curry at Thai spice levels though, you'll LOVE this!"
1,"We love Thai food and was thrilled to find Maesri Thai Green Curry. This curry is great tasting, authentically flavored, and fairly hot. We like that it comes in a paste as it easy use in our cooking.<br /><br />Highly recommended! You might also want to try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETLVXC"">Maesri Thai red curry - 4 oz x 2 cans</a>."
1,"good spicy tasty. but u have to develop a taste for it. If u dont like thai and trying this out as a first option, i would suggest that u wait"
0,"This sauce is very strange tasting with a lot of spice.<br />I was going to use this as the base for a pizza sauce, but not even huge amounts of sugar / honey could save this sauce.  It also starts off very watery (not good value for your money).<br />I will never buy this tomato sauce again."
0,"This is the most acidic tomato sauce I've ever used. It's almost as tart as a lemon. I put it in an old family lasagne recipe, but neglected to taste it at first. By then it was too late.  I tried to soften the astringent taste with sugar and sauteed mushrooms, but this was only partially successful. The only thing that saved the dish were copious amounts of Bechamel sauce in the layering. They claim they use only Roma tomatoes, but I'm doubtful. I can't imagine any recipe that would benefit from this sauce."
1,"I was introduced to Zevia by a friend.  This is the ""cleanest"" pop you will find and it is delicious!  The grapefruit is my favorite but all have been really good. Warning to those who have NEVER tasted anything with Stevia in it be prepared for a different taste.  I recommend you use stevia in other foods to get accustomed to the taste before forking out the $$$ for this.  If you haven't had stevia before then you probably won't care to much for it.  In my opinion stevia is an acquired taste...which now I love!  I like the fact that I can give this to my kids with worrying about what the harsh chemicals and sugar are going to do to them!  They both love it too...especially the orange and grape.  Even my husband likes the rootbeer!  I can't wait to get the rainbow pack in this week!!  Yummy!"
1,"I know you're thinking no way, but actually this is really good. It is hard to find this soda on sale in grocery stores, so the price of this case is pretty competitive. The best part about this purchase was getting to try 2 cans of every flavor. Here are my favorites:<br /><br />Cola, Caffeine free Cola, Root Beer, Grape, Dr. Zevia, Mountain Zevia, Cream Soda, Lemon Lime Twist.<br /><br />Flavors I wasnt crazy about:<br /><br />Ginger Ale, Black Cherry, Grapefruit Citrus, Orange.<br /><br />Having a husband to pawn those last four flavors off on is awesome! Stranded on a desert island, I would pick the Root Beer. It even makes a great chaser, although I prefer the Cola for chasers."
1,"This is such a great idea.  I like drinking all 12 flavors, depending on my mood.  Now I can buy them all at once."
1,"Love the Zevia <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005YYFHCS"">Zevia All Natural Soda, Rainbow Case, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>products. I don't eat sugar and the sweeteners in all the other diet drinks I've tried (they usually have aspartame) give me a migraine and make me feel horrible. This uses the stevia plant (or rebiana) and erythritol. I've researched erythritol and it seems to be the least harmful of all sugar derived substitutes (it also does not kick me into a sugar craving like some of the other substitutes). Anyway, some of the flavors were a little weird to me at first, like the cola flavor but after the second or third can I started to get a taste for it. I now find them more enjoyable than regular or other diet sodas. Other flavors were great off the bat, like cherry. My favorite is Mtn. Zevia but I read some other reviews that thought it was horrible. FYI Truvia <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005P0VEMS"">Truvia Nature""s Calorie-Free Natural Sweetener - 40 Packets</a>sweetener is also made of stevia and erythritol and I find it great for sweetening and cooking, though it took some practice. Zero cal. SOBE <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FXIUWY"">Sobe Lifewater Variety Pack - 12/20oz Bottles</a>also a great drink and sweetened with erythritol. Many grocery stores carry the SOBE Lifewater for $1.00 per bottle."
1,"Zevia arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Very satisfied with purchase and would purchase again. Good opportunity to sample all the flavors, many of which are not available in retail grocery stores in my area."
0,"I had a ginger ale from a health food store and was hooked! I have been trying to get away from diet coke, a battle that has been going on for years. I use stevia in the raw in pretty much everything now and was really excited to find a line of sodas that used it. I, or course, was carried away and ordered a case on auto delivery. Mistake. The sodas really are all SOOO sweet, it's nauseating. The makers need to lighten up on the stevia. I still enjoy the ginger ale but am forcing myself to try and get through the remaining case. I can take 2-3 sips of the others before I am turned off. So just get the ginger ale or skip in general. Blah. too bad:("
1,"My husband and I try not to drink any soda, diet or regular but I saw this on special on Amazon and got some. Really great flavor! My husband who likes regular soda when he can get it (we drink alot of iced tea and coffee) enjoyed this and all the flavors were a surprise! The flavor that was supposed to be like Mountain Dew was just gross to us, nasty so I took one star off for that flavor. The Dr Pepper version and the ginger ale were the best. I would still buy this in a mix and will give the Mt Dew flavor to my son:o)"
0,"I RECIEVED MY DRINKS AND WAS LOOKING FOR LOTS OF FLAVOR--WRONG.  THE FLAVOR WAS WEAK AND THERE WAS, WAY, TO MUCH FIZZ. NOT WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY YOU PAY FOR THESE DRINKS.  EVEN THE SWEETNER, WAS NOT MUCH PRESENT, NOT VERY SWEET."
1,"Honestly, I hate drinking regular cola because of the excessively sweet sugar taste lingering in my mouth, and the diet or zero versions aren't much better because the sweet-n-low taste is just as bad as sugar. So I tried what supposedly is the only carbonated drink that is truly natural.<br />Taste-wise, it is NOT an alternative to other popular cola brands.<br />Zevia comes in variety of flavors that are suppose to imitate the regular drinks (Mountain Zevia, Dr.Zevia, ... really??), but they are not even close to how the originals taste.<br />However, different as they may be, I LOVE the taste of these Zevia soda, much more than other 'original' soda. They taste much more... crisp and natural, without having the lingering sugar/sweet-n-low taste. The natural ingredients, mainly stevia, really has a unique taste that is completely different than sugar.<br /><br />If you are looking for a healthy alternative that taste pretty much the same as regular soda, you WILL be disappointed.<br /><br />However, as an entirely separate drink with a completely unique taste, it is, by far, my favorite soda, and I am completely addicted."
1,If you are looking for a great tasting diet soda and want to stay away from aspartame and saccharin this is a great alternative-- tastes GREAT!
1,"In an effort to cut down on my refined sugar intake, I use Stevia as my main sweetener so was glad to stumble across Zevia.  However, you need to keep your expectations in check.  Think of them as a bunch of new unnamed sodas without the sugar.  So enjoy the discovery of the new soda flavors.  For example, I was a huge Dr. Pepper fan and there is no way that I would mistake Dr. Zevia for Dr. Pepper.  And if you were to ask me if the Cola tastes more like Coke or Pepsi, I would have to say ""none of the above"".  For root beer fans, the Zevia root beer comes very close.  I do enjoy the Zevia flavors and Dr. Zevia is one of my favorites, but it just doesn't taste at all like Dr. Pepper.  The rainbow case is a wonderful idea as it lets you try all the different flavors.  Until they come out with a Stevia sweetened Dr. Pepper, I will enjoy the different flavors of Zevia."
1,I was looking for an acceptable substitute for diet pop as i am looking to get away from aspartame.  Zevia fulfills that need and i love all the Zevia flavors.  The 24 pack is great as i get 2 of each Zevia flavor. Can't wait to try their 3 new ones.
1,When i order this soda I was expecting the worst. But much to my pleasant surprise the soda was great. My Daughter 15 and 6 both love them. They pack them in there school lunch. The ginger ale is wonderful. The taste is great. I't hard to believe that this soda is the real deal but it is. I had put my self on auto ship for 3 month but the case a disappeared because every time someone come over I have to let them try it.I need a new case now. Can't wait to get it. I haven't had cream soda in a very long time but that Cream soda is Delicious.
0,"With all the positive reviews I really was looking forward to trying this but was sadly disappointed when I received my shipment and tried 2 of the flavors.  So far I've had the orange and the cola...not enjoyable at all.  I had realistic expectations and did not expect it to taste like the ""regular"" sugar or even ""diet"" versions that are popular.  But, I had hoped they would at least be good.  My teens and I dislike the taste completely.  There is also a very bitter aftertaste that lingers for a long time.  Ugh.  I'm going to stick to my carbonated water with a slice of lemon from now on. **Have tried all the flavors and still do not like this product.  I have had other products with Stevia that are acceptable, the aftertaste on this one is horrible."
0,"I bought this thinking it would be a good alternative to the regular soda I drink.  And I have to admit, when you first drink it it is OK.  It does have a weird aftertaste though, which bothers me the more i drink.  Maybe I will get used to it but I doubt it.<br /><br />I will certainly not be purchasing this product again."
1,"If you are drinking diet soda for the taste, please read what other reviewers have written re: the taste of Zevia.  Stevia lends a unique taste that may take some getting used to.  It is ""different"" than standard diet drink taste.  That being said, if you are drinking diet soda to watch your waistline, you need to step over to Stevia as a sweetener NOW.  Journal papers in Behavioral Neuroscience and the Journal of Animal Science have established the so-called ""sweetness response"" in which insulin is released in response to sweet taste, rather than as a direct response to sugar-based content.  Insulin without something to metabolize is very efficient way of creating fat.  This is why drinking diet drinks does not help you loose weight.  In fact, if you switch to diet drinks and change nothing else about your diet and exercise regimen, you will GAIN weight.  I have not seen the scientific evidence, but I have  read in at least two non-science books, that Stevia does not cause the insulin release that nutri-sweet and saccharine  do.  This makes Zevia an actual diet drink.  While I agree that soda should be refrained from for reasons other than making one fat (it is bad for the teeth, irritates GERD, among other ill effects), it is unfortunately, the one habit I simply cannot break myself of.  While Zevia is not a health food, at least won't make me gain weight."
0,"I'm not a huge soda drinker because of the carbs and calories. I don't ever drink traditional diet drinks because I do not like the diet soda taste. I use stevia in the raw at home daily and I have enjoyed the lack of calorie sweetness that it gives me, which lead me to try these sodas.<br /><br />To wrap it up, they have a very strong diet drink taste which is what I was trying to avoid to begin with. If you don't like artificial sweeteners as a concept but don't mind the taste, these drinks may be a more natural alternative for you. Dont expect any of the flavors to taste like anything but a diet soda."
1,"All the flavors are pretty great, the least tasteful mostly because the aftertaste is a little funky is the orange flavored one albeit everyone's opinion will vary. My wife likes the Dr. Zevia but does say it pales in comparison with the brand name product it's trying to replace.  Well anyway if your on a diet or can't use sugar this is the way to go! At least it'll keep you away from nutrasweet and similar other harmful products that are allowed in our food."
1,"I've been using stevia for years, so when I saw this product, recommended by Shane from the people's chemist, I knew I had to try it. I am so glad I did! Now I can have a soda without feeling that I'm doing my body harm. And the best part is they taste great! The root beer is my favorite, but I do like getting  the variety pack so I'm never bored."
1,"I believe many people who choose Stevia as their sweetener of choice are health-conscious and, as such, would prefer to avoid Aluminum cans (re: Alzheimer's risk) and plastic bottles (re: cancer risk from BPA and phthalates) so glass is the only viable packaging material for this discerning audience.  Otherwise  I enjoy the taste and appreciate the all natural ingredients (especially that no artificial colors are added). I have tried Grape, Cola, and Orange.  For now I will experiment making my own soda on-demand with club soda and organic flavor extracts with either Stevia or Dextrose sweetener."
1,"I AM A TYPE TWO DIEBETIC....,I NEEDED A SODA THAT I COULD ENJOY BUT NOT RAISE MY BLOOD SUGARS........NOT ABLE TO FIND ANYTHING UNTIL FINALLY ZEVIA CAME ALONG....I LOVE THE TASTE....I EJJOYED TASTING ALL THE FLAVORS IN THE RAINBOW PACK....BUT MOST OF ALL I LOVED THAT MY BLOOD SUGARS ARE FINALLY LEVELING OFF AND I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER ALL AROUND........HURRAY FOR ZEVIA!!p>s> ANOTHER SUGGENSTION WOULD BE TO MAKE MORE FLAVORS IN CAFFINE FREE TO HELP THOSE NON SLEEPERS GET SOME SLEEP!!"
1,"I have not had soda in years because of all the garbage ingredients that they all contain. I decided to try these out since they were sweetened with stevia. I thought it might be a nice treat to occasionally have one. They are very good and my husband seems to like them too. I don't notice any weird aftertaste as some other have reported, and they also arrived quickly and in tact. They are a little pricey, but I would definitely be willing to order again as an occasional treat or to keep some soda in the house when visitors come over. The variety pack also gave us a good opportunity to try them out and figure out which ones were our favorites."
1,This 'rainbow pack' has a great selection of different Zevia drinks.  Love Zevia and this gave me an idea of what other flavors are available. Will keep ordering this.
1,"Awesome,Shipped fast, and a great value.  Many flavor options and they are all good. Great alternative to other options available in stores."
1,"As other folks describe, this soda has a different taste due to the stevia and erythritol sweeteners. It's not bitter or bad like other diet sodas, but it definitely tastes different than sugar sodas. However, when I crave a sweet soda, this fills the need without all the sugar and without the side effects of other artificial sweeteners. I bought the variety pack figuring that I'd prefer one or two of the flavors and so I'd buy only those next time. However, I like all the flavors equally."
1,"I hate to say it, but do not expect Zevia to taste the same as regular ""soda"". It has a distinct flavor all it's own. So far I like the Dr.Zevia as it is not as strong and tart as the ginger soda. My local supplier only carries 3 flavors. The rasberry is also very tart. So this is the only recommendation I can make, but not having artificial flavors, caffeine , carmel coloring, high fructose corn syrup is worth getting use to in my opinion. Thanks Amazon, face book and Zevia for teaming up!"
0,"Greatly appreciate Amazon carrying this product, as it affords customers the opportunity to evaluate this product.<br /><br />The case arrived without the Dr. Zevia (Dr. Pepper cans).  Ginger root beer had been substituted and doubled.  Unfortunately, I bought this specifically to try the cola, ginger ale, and Dr. pepper equivalents.<br /><br />The grape and orange are the better products, although they have no coloring.<br /><br />Unfortunately, almost all of the soda's have an aftertaste...reminiscent of saccharin in some peoples opinion.<br /><br />Some found the taste to be cloying.  No one found any taste to be fresh, crisp, or refreshing.<br /><br />I had such high hopes for Stevia in soda.<br /><br />Even Canada dry diet ginger ale has more ginger taste than Zevia ginger ale.  Zevia cola did not remind me of any similar cola I have ever had.  In fact, a blind test would have revealed a mildly sweet beverage with no outstanding taste markers and of benign flavor."
1,"I'm amazed at some of the bad reviews here, but can only assume that some of them, at least, come from people who expected Zevia's colas to taste just like their more famous counterparts.  Well, they don't taste exactly the same... The ingredients are totally different, so of course they will taste different.  However, I LOVE the taste of Zevia.  It tastes clean and crisp, and makes brand-name sodas taste especially gross to me now.  I am a former addict of Diet Mt. Dew and was so happy to find a healthier product to replace it.  Was the first glass of Mt. Zevia exactly what I expected?  No.  But by the second glass, I was hooked.  I haven't looked back!  I've liked every flavor I've tried, and am on the hunt for the new Strawberry flavor to buy locally."
1,"When I first started drinking this soda, I was really surprised. None of the flavors that come in the rainbow case accurately recreate their non-stevia counterpart. In general, this could be because  of the stevia, or it could be due to a flavoring. However, they don't taste bad! In fact, they're quite tasty, and in a lot of cases, I actually prefer the taste of this version over others. For example, while the ""Dr. Zevia"" tasted nothing like Dr Pepper, I loved it! Out of all of the flavors, I would say that the ginger root beer and the grapefruit are my favorites. I've gone through at least 10 cases at this point, and I doubt I will stop any time soon."
1,"I was pleasantly surprised by what I've tried so far.  The grape, orange, etc. flavors are clear, no harmful artificial colorings. Friends over enjoyed it also.  Trying a variety pack is the way to go."
1,"I have been drinking Zevia for about two years.  They have a ton of flavors now compared to when they first started out.  Their 'Cola' and 'Root Beer' equivalents are my favorite.  I'm NOT a fan of their 'Dr. Pepper' equivalent.  I have tried most of their flavors and enjoyed their 'Mountain Dew', 'Grape', 'Orange', and 'Cream Soda' equivalents, but again, really really enjoying their 'Cola' and 'Root Beer' flavors the best.<br /><br />If you want to try a healthier less sugary version of your Coke Cola, give this a shot and I think you wont be disappointed.  I just added their ""rainbow pack"" to my subscribe and save for the family.  I have one coming every 2 months.  They like them as well :)<br /><br />It's really a guilt free soda and you don't have to worry about all the crazy chemicals that come with the name brand diet soda's.<br /><br />As a side note, I had to deal with their customer service once and was happy with how they handled me question.  It was in regards to one of their ""natural flavor"" ingredients.<br /><br />At the very least, give them a shot, you might end up being glad you did."
0,I use stevia and sugar blend in my tea etc.  I thought this would taste good but it tasted just like other diet drinks (bad).<br />Very expensive mistake.
0,"I received this product last week and my husband and I have been slowly trying the drinks. Thus far, the horrible outweigh the okay. The Grape was okay...the Dr. Zevia was okay...and that's been about the only okay products. The Mt.Zevia was like a flat Mt. Dew, the Cola was nothing like cola, the Ginger root beer was like a carbonated chai drink. They have been such a let down. I am very bummed that this was not a good product as I grew up on diet drinks and am quite attached to them. Not these. Never again, nor would I recommend them."
0,"I know this is supposed to be the ""healthy"" alternative for pop drinkers, but I'm just going to continue my shift towards iced green tea for my caffeine and drink fix.  The Stevia just has too much of a tangy aftertaste for me, and this stuff isn't exactly priced in the everyday-consumption price range."
0,"My personal opinion is they are terrible. I will not recomend them, or buy them again. NO FLAVOR AT ALL"
0,"I do a lot of shopping on Amazon and this is the first bad product that I have received. I usually don't bash products but, these are terrible. The root beer and dr pepper clone do smell good at first but, it goes down hill from there. The mountain dew clone was the worst, I about gagged. All have the same nasty bitter taste and terrible odor with the individual flavor added on top. All 24 cans down the drain or should I say 27 bucks down the drain. It kind of reminds me of red bull or a preworkout/no2 drink. Fine if you have to drink it but, not if you want a drink to enjoy. I use stevia daily in my ice tea and coffee and it is great so, I don't think it's the stevia."
0,"I so wanted to like this product.  I am trying to eliminate Splenda from my diet and was hoping this would be something I could use in this.  Unfortunately, I did not like it.  It tastes like Alka-Seltzer to me, with some flavorings thrown in.  :("
1,The all natural taste comes with a hefty price and a little bit of a bad after taste.  I have since went back to diet coke and perhaps the onslaught of all the bad health(Unproven) issues associated with it
1,My order arrived in a very timely manner and was in great condition.  It has been so nice to try the various flavors without having to purchase large quantities of them.
1,"I like to drink diet drinks over tea but do not like to eat or drink anything with aspartame, so I tried these a few months ago. I was pleasantly surprised, the flavors are refreshin, love all except for their version of mountain dew, as I really don't care for the dew original.<br /><br />I have several favorites, but will still continue to subscribe to the ""sampler"" case as I love having choices when going to the fridge or the cooler. And the price is so much better than buying the limited flavor six packs at Whole Foods.<br /><br />Hooray for Amazon, my favorite place to shop for anything!"
0,"First I must say until recently I have never found a diet soda that actually tastes good enough to drink regularly. I was very excited to receive the Zevia All Natural Sodas because I have insulin resistance and I'm not supposed to have alot of sugar. I use the Truvia and Stevia sugar and I thought it would be a good idea to try the soda. I ended up giving the sodas away to a coworker and I'm sure my coworker threw them away. The taste is awful. The ""coke"" soda is way too sweet. The only flavors that I tried to convince myself that I could drink were grape, orange and cream soda and even those are not really good. If you are looking for a good tasting diet soda a coworker brought me a can of Sprite Zero, and it was actually good. It's not far off from the original Sprite. Oh, and my coworker was drinking Rockstar which I guess is another diet soda and he said Rockstar tastes better than the Zevia soda."
0,"I saw this product on Amazon and was excited that it was all natural and zero calories, so i brought a case of the Cream soda. What a disappointment.  The soda has a really wicked after taste that lasts for a long time,very bitter. I will stick to my Diet Pepsi, it's cheaper and no aftertaste."
0,"I'm so sad because I REALLY wanted these to be good.  They're not.  Seriously, don't waste your money thinking you'll enjoy one of them, as they ALL have the same terrible aftertaste."
0,"I recently began using an artificial sweetener called ZSweet (ingredients: erythritol and stevia).  THere is absolutely no aftertaste or bitterness to this product, and I nearly can't tell the difference between it and sugar - and it's the only zero calorie sweetener I can stand.<br /><br />I went looking for products that contain erythritol and I was SO excited when I discovered this brand of soda. It would be so nice to be able to drink the occasional soda again. So I ordered this sampler.<br /><br />I've tried 6 of the 12 flavors.  They all have a very distinct, terrible aftertaste.  What a disappointment."
0,"I was very let down with this product, I have purchased the Switch <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O"">The Switch Sparkling Juice, Orange Tangerine, 8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>brand soda and was very pleased with it's delicious flavor but this drink is totally different.<br /> First of all it is sweetened primarily with Erythritol which is an alcohol based sweetener and is bitter tasting like other diet sodas,<br />but that isn't all, it also causes stomach cramping (among other things) within 30 minutes of drinking it.<br />Needless to say I'll be cancelling my future orders and going back to the Switch brand."
0,"At first, the soda tastes great, but then the stevia or whatever else they put in it kicks in.  You are left with a very unnatural taste and feeling inside your mouth.  The aftertaste is a deal breaker.  I resolved to slam the last four of the sodas so I only had to deal with one final aftertaste.  The aftertaste/freeling of four sodas lasted for several days, even after drinking other things, eating, brushing, flossing, and waterpik'ing."
0,"1.  Box arrived with case wrapped in a plastic bag, containing one can (empty), and a soggy cardboard tray with the other 23 cans. It appears to have blown up either prior to, or at UPS, as the box was a UPS box.<br /><br />2.  Positive- the level of carbonation was very good.<br /><br />3.  The flavors reminded me of rancid cough syrup. NONE of the 12 flavors were worth more than a sip, or the second can. There was a full-on flavor malfunction and also an aftertaste that did not want to go away.  The Dr. Zevia certainly was named well, for the resemblance to medicine.  The root beer smelled like root beer.  The fruit flavors weren't artificially colored, so essentially all looked like lemon-lime (which is actually fine by me).<br /><br />I'm just glad I got the sampler case, and wasn't left with 23  full cans and one with a single sip taken out of it.  The first two cans, I'd poured over ice, and took a good slug, and nearly choked.  After that, it was a tentative sip of the remaining 10 flavors.  I couldn't find ONE that I'd ever want to have again.<br /><br />I REALLY wanted to like this stuff. I'm a diabetic, so diet soda isn't just a preference- it's what I have to have if I'm going to drink soda at all. I budgeted for 2 cases from my next pay check (guess I'll be getting more cases of WATER).  I generally like erythritol and stevia sweetened items- especially erythritol- I use it on cereal.  Tastes just like sugar, and can be used for baking as well as cold items.<br /><br />Total waste of more than $25.  That could have bought my perishable items this week."
1,"There really isn't much to say about this.  If you like freeze-dried ice cream, you'll probably like this.  Like all freeze-dried ice cream, it seems ridiculously overpriced for what you get, but that's the way it goes.  About a quarter of the tube is filled with smooshed crumbs, but it eats the same.  The tube is small, of course - about 1.5 times the height of a chapstick and maybe twice the diameter.  It has white, brown, and pink balls (white seems to be the largest).  I listed them by color because I can't really say that they taste like vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry because they are so small.  All in all, I think I prefer the small bricks better than these little balls, but I kind of enjoyed flipping the top and pouring some into my mouth."
1,"Glad to find good old fashioned dubble bubble for a good price. My whole office likes to indulge their sweet tooth, and the child inside!"
1,"Ah Dubble Bubble.  It starts out really hard, the flavor doesn't last too long, but you can blow amazing bubbles!  This is a great bucket to get for stuffing a pinata or just to keep around.  This is sure to delight kids or nostalgic adults."
1,"I found out about the pepper sauce (actually more like a paste) from a recipe using it in the LA Times magazine. I decided to try a jar, & fell in love at first taste. Use it as a base layer on home made pizza dough, just smear some on & put your other topping over it. Heat up a big blob of it in a pan w/ some olive oil over low heat to get it melted into a sauce (I add a couple chopped clove of garlic in case of vampires, add some uncooked thawed shrimp till done, and toss with some al denta pasta. Shrimp scampi with attitude!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003U8BMJM"">Tutto Calabria Hot Pepper Sauce 6.7 oz</a>"
1,"Definitely unlike other pepper pastes, like GIA and Amore that come in tubes. It's thick like a tomato paste. The flavor is tangy and hints a little Asian flavors, though it is distinctly Italian pepper flavors. I wasn't expecting a specific taste or texture when I bought it so I'm pretty happy with getting something that I haven't experience before. I will find a lot of uses for this.<br /><br />I could see it being an excellent addition to a spicy pasta sauce, or pizza sauce. It may also work well mixed with olive oil and used as a base or spread for breads and pizza and such.<br /><br />Also, it's fairly hot, but not too hot. It's fine for most people who like a little heat, but anyone who likes only very mild spiciness will want to pass on this."
0,"I swear it tasted like vinegar, so very disappointed. I know I have bought Pepperwood Grove before, maybe it was the Chardonnay that was good but the Pinot Grigio was an absolute waste of money, won't even save it to cook with."
1,I just used 2 tablespoons with one half cup of milk and some ice and it tastes just like a green tea frap from Starbucks. Add a little whipcream to the top and it's perfect. It's at a fraction of the cost. We love it and I will definitely buy again.
1,"I Made Green Tea Ice Cream with this using the recipe on our Ice Cream Maker, minus the sugar called for.<br /><br />Janice M."
1,If you have ever spent the summer in Japan and had their green tea shaved ice this is what you had. They serve up shaved green tea ice in a big bowl and it is the cats meow. You can find it cheaper in some of the Asian stores. Buy it durning the winter as it us usually on sale and then enjoy it on a hot summer evening. Mix it up and freeze it until it is almost hard and throw it in the blender to make a slush. Pure enjoyment
1,"If you are tired of spending 5 bucks at the local barrista for a green tea frappichino, cheat. This powder is the same mix as used by the big coffee house chains. Get out your blender and make your own. Addictive!!!"
1,"Surprisingly, the recipe on the back for Matcha Milk is just like the base of a Starbucks (or shall I say ""Sixbucks"") Green Tea Frappuccino. I will use this product wisely!"
1,"Bought this so I can make green tea cake and cupcakes.  When I opened the package, it was a smaller bag than i thought it was going to be but I guess a little goes a long way?  Great price."
1,"I love love this product. easy to make and so refreshing. i was able to contact the maker and found it in my area, now i can save on the shipping and handeling!"
1,I wish they would use xylitol or stevia instead of sugar to make this healthier.<br />It's very delicious and probably healthier than soda though. I would recommend this for an occasional sweet treat. Addictive.
1,this powder tea has granulated sugar in it to make it sweet. If your looking for it to be a healthy sweet your out of luck but if not I would say this product is delicious. It's presweetened so you ust put in a scoop and your on your way to drinking traditional green tea.
0,This stuff does taste kinda like starbucks. But with all the sugar I did'nt really enjoy it. Buy this if your running low on sugar and don't like green tea.
1,"I first learned about maqui berries in a health food magazine, and couldn't wait to try it out. Not only is it jam packed with great vitamins and minerals, but it also has the highest antioxident value of any discovered fruit. The taste is very similar to the Acai berry, but in powder form, the maqui is quite bitter. I recommend mixing it with some other fruit. The way I use this powder is in a morning smoothie---it gives me a full day's worth of fruits and 1 serving of veggies all jam packed into my breakfast...I love this because it's always so hard to fit in fruits and veggies otherwise.<br /><br />My smoothie:<br />2 tsp maqui powder<br />1 tbsp chia seeds (also a super food)<br />1 tbsp wheatgrass powder (another superfood)<br />1/2 cup fresh or frozen fruit (I normally use strawberries, blueberries, or mango)<br />6 or 7 ice cubes<br />1/2 to 3/4 cup water<br /><br />Makes me feel full all morning long. Hope you enjoy this as much as I do!"
1,This stuff is amazing. I eat it right of the bag by the spoonfull.The deep purple color is very captivating to the senses.
1,"This tea blend is excellent and tasty. Usually teas with valerian root are hard to drink as they smell/taste bad; not this blend! The Healing Tree blend has great flavor and will put you to zzzzzzzzzz.<br />Finally a good valerian root blend on the market.<br />We also like The Healing Tree Herbal Blend Echinacea Immune, Caffeine Free Loose Leaf Blend Tea, 2.08-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)It works wonders especially during the cold season."
1,"These are great snacks.  They're similar to the veggie sticks I often get in my local supermarket, but the shape is a bit fatter and hollow in the middle.  this makes them lighter and unfortunately easier for me to eat a lot of them."
1,"I just reviewed the sweet potato variety of these and wanted to share my thoughts on the veggie tortilla. I have bought bagged snacks very similar to these in the past for my kids, but while relatively healthy they weren't GMO-free. My kids loved these and I really appreciated the lack of genetically modified junk."
1,I couldn't get enough of these things.<br />I couldn't get enough of these things.<br />I couldn't get enough of these things.
0,wow. they may have good numbers as far as nutrition (or lack of bad things) goes but where's the flavor? yuk.
0,Too pricy for what you get. I was expecting something delicious but unfortunately it's just a plain tortilla taste with a different look. You could get the same thing with any other brand name without having to pay a lot for it.
1,"These really are great bars- no I am in no way associated with the company, but can say I have tried all kinds of sports nutrition bars and this is one of the best around for sheer performance.  Use it as directed and you will be impressed too. I think this flavor is pretty tolerable-- after about 10 of them they begin to feel a little like compacted saw dust, but if you mix up the favors a bit it is not a big deal.  My wife loves this flavor, but it is my 3rd favorite that I have tried.  I wish they sold them in larger boxes or you could put them on auto delivery and save a little more on them.  I wouldn't do another tough mudder race with out them!"
1,"I typically get these bars at race expos but ran out and needed some to take on a trip.  They were a great price,  delivered on time.  I really love this product."
1,There spices and products are great. I live in a very northern area that does not have big stores or specialty shops so it is wonderful to be able to fill my spice shelf with every thing I need. Fabulous customer service too.
1,"My girlfriend procured a pack of these the other day and had me sample several of the flavors.<br />I generally have a discerning fruit candy flavor- I dislike many flavors (Eg orange, anything blue etc etc) however I was taken aback by the incredible flavor of these gummies.<br />The consistency is perfect- firm but yielding in each piece, lightly covered in non-overwhelming sour grits perfect for chewers and suckers alike. I will continually use perfect to an excessive amount, because this is exactly what these sour candies are.<br />The shapes are all in hearts, which makes perfect (again!) sense. There is a myriad of flavors, including out-there pomegranate and mango, which is not normally found in the sour candy sections. Each pack contains a generous helping of these candies, so each pack, regardless of the count, will last you quite a while (unless you're like me, or have friends).<br />Contains real fruit juice, great flavor and is so addicting I'm going to go steal more from her, and not finish this rev"
1,"Have introduced to a number of people & have them all hooked. Best sour gummy ever, great flavors! Got it at a great price!"
1,"I highly recommend this product. However, it is cheaper to buy it at a store than online in bulk!"
1,"I purchased these as a treat for my dogs.(Yes they are spoiled).My grandkids, husband and I found them delicious!! P.S. The dogs loved when they could sneek some."
1,"Jack Link does jerky better than just about anyone, and these are no exception. Nicely chewy without feeling like your jaws will give out. Good salty and beefy flavor. Amazon's prices are usually lower than in the store, even store sale prices."
1,This Jerky has been the Greatest I Have Had in Years Only Home Made Jerky is Better.<br />  Mick PHX AZ.
0,"Ordered two packages.  Each was supposed to have four bags.  One package was opened and one bag was missing.  Whoever boxed the two packages must have been hungry and helped themselves to one.  In addition, they were overpriced.  I see them at the checkout counter at WalMart for $3 a bag.  Do the math."
1,"Love this product, just wish it were available in stores near me. I have found the buffalo fire kind which I don't like. Have not found the turkey jerky yet. Till then, guess I'll continue to purchase it from here."
0,"I'm a big fan of Jack Link's beef jerky, especially their flavored jerky's. I hadn't seen this one in the stores so when it went on sale on Amazon I scooped it up. Generally the beef nuggets and tendercuts style jerky's are not my favorite, for some reason the beef gets very rubbery compared to the regular style cuts, but I knew this diving into the bag of jerky.<br /><br />At first the taste was like the beef had been dropped in a pile of debris on a smokehouse floor, smokey, meaty and ashy tasting. I thought maybe it was just the initial taste  and continued to chew. It only worsened as I continued and eventually I swallowed and was met with a disgusting taste left in my mouth.<br /><br />Now that I have all four bags remaining I'm not sure what to do with them. I may give them away as a gag gift for the holidays and literally watch people gag as they try to eat this."
1,"Very good. Tastes like Original Jack Links only with a little more flavor. Very tender and not dry, but a little on the salty side. The bag is HUGE though and there is a tiny amount in the bag! It's disappointing."
1,"It's hard to judge this stuff as jerky, really, since it doesn't have a lot of ""jerk"" - they're little strips about the size and shape of a french fry - perhaps three inches long, and about 3/8"" square. Thanks probably to powerful industrial meat chemicals, they're incredibly tender, and make great little meat-flavored snacks. My only problem with them is that you get maybe a dozen strips per bag, and they're kinda expensive to get so little. Oh well, meat's expensive."
1,I buy the turkey jerky now and then as a tasty way to get some extra protein either before/after a workout or as a snack throughout the day. It's a little bit steep on the sodium to have a bunch of it but other than that it's great. I like it a lot. Recommended.
1,"I liked that it was chicken, you dont have to rip your teeth out tearing a bite off. With a chew it comes apart. Probably would have like a different flavor and with the bulk that I bought that was kind of a bummer. Id advise people to get a bag of each to see what flavor you like best. Not do what I did and get a unknown flavor in bulk."
0,I couldn't eat this after 1 first bite. I thought I was chewing salt marinated beef strips. Yuck! So disappointed at Jack Link's
0,"This is not up to par for Jack Links products.  These are awful!  Gritty, they taste like I imagine dog snacks would taste."
0,Make your own jerky and save money.  This product has MSG in it.  It's bad for you and unhealthy.  Just look on youtube how to make it yourself.  You don't need preservatives in your homemade jerky if you eat it within the week.
1,"I by chance found this on the bottom row at a super Wal-Mart. I have tried a few other brands...some made from just corn and some from rice, but this company has got to be the best so far. It is just like eating regular pasta. I am hoping Amazon will carry it, but for now, I will just have to hope they are still being sold at Wal-Mart. Being allergic to gluten is not enjoyable. The alternatives that we find, most times are just not the same, so it was nice the night we sat down to dinner and discovered how good dinner was."
1,"A distributor for foods here in Vegas gave me a package to try and I fell in love with it. I couldn't find it anywhere. Then I heard it might be a WalMart, and sure enough it was! I bought two packages and just finished a big bowl of spaghetti. On a hunch I checked Amazon and lo and behold it is here and on PRIME no less! Another reviewer echoed my same feeling that it is the perfect blend of rice and corn, so the corn doesn't overwhelm the sauce. Bravo!!!! I'll be making this pasta our household standard from here on. No more need to look. This is it!<br /><br />Vicki in Vegas"
1,"This pasta is so much better than other GF pasta. It must be the combination of rice and corn that makes it so much better. I've not been too excited about pasta made from just rice or corn, but this one is terrific."
1,"And my picky son even enjoyed it with plain butter.  No bitter after-taste, keeps its consistency, even when reheated in hot water for a couple of minutes."
1,"My 15 year old daughter has just been diagnosed as gluten intolerant so we are on the quest to find as ""normal"" of food as we can.  This pasta definitely fits the bill - tastes great, just like semolina pasta. I'm very happy my sister told me about it - it will be our pasta of choice from now on."
1,"Like most who find out about the GF world, we've tried all the pastas we could with mixed results.  The rice pasta would be a gummy mess and don't ask about leftovers...  The corn based pastas weren't bad, but still not as close to the old wheat flour pastas as Heartland GF pastas.  There's another GF company who also does a really good corn/rice pasta blend, but comparatively Heartland is a better buy and hard to tell the difference.  Now with both WM and Amazon carrying them it's a great buy vs. others at $4+/box!  Well, until Heartland or the like make the corn-rice blend in a full-size lasagna sheet we'll just have spaghetti night around our house until then.  At least now we're able to fully enjoy it!"
1,"We've been cooking gluten-free for 32 years, with three celiacs in the family.  My husband discovered Heartland GF Spaghetti at a restaurant and we all agree this tastes and cooks like ""real"" spaghetti.I was delighted when Amazon started carrying it.  Now it's out of stock!  Please say you'll carry it regularly."
0,"I didn't buy this item, although I was about to. I went to the manufacturer website to look at the nutrition label. All is good until you get to the very end where it says it is processed in a facility WITH Wheat."
1,We have found this pasta to be the best we've tried yet in our 6 months of GF living. Definitely recommend this product for those who have to be GF and those non-GF sharing a meal. You'll love it! Tastes like 'regular' pasta.
1,So far these are the best gluten free noodles I have tried.  The hold up well when boiling and taste good.  I love them.
1,"I'm very gluten intolerant, but my family isn't.  With this pasta, they can't tell the difference so I can fix us all the same and they don't even realize it's wheat free.  Love it!!!"
1,"This is the best gluten free pasta I have eaten to date. When it was no longer available at Walmart I started shopping, and bought up some Penne and Fusilli. A call to Heartland revealed that the gluten free products will not be run again until the fall. Start posting alternatives boys and girls because thats's all there is and there ain't no more."
1,This was the first GF pasta I tried and I'm happy that it was!  This made great spaghetti.  I cooked it towards the longer end of what the bag called for.  There is NO aftertaste and is edible without any sauce on it!  The great thing is that you can find this at Walmart.  I've stocked up now!  My whole family enjoyed it (including my toddler)!
1,This pasta is awesome. It has great texture and flavor. There is no difference between this pasta or wheat pasta.  I highly recommend this to anyone who loves pasta whether it is gluten free or not.
1,This was a super tasting pasta.  It did not stick together or taste very much different than regular wheat pasta.  Did not have the texture of rubber like some rice pasta's. Make sure to take note of recommended cooking time.  Will definitely buy again!
0,"Customers with gluten-intolerance: Be aware that this product is described as ""gluten-free"" and ""wheat-free,"" but it is ""processed in the facility that uses wheat and egg.""<br /><br />12/02/2011: As ""food,"" this item cannot be returned. However, Amazon still issued me a refund. Thank you very much. I am going to donate the item to a food-bank."
0,Was excited to try based on reviews.  No matter how much oil and stirring this is stickly and mushy and is nothing like the real pasta consistancy.  Do not waste your time and money on this product.
1,"I really loved this pasta! It tastes just like natural spaghetti but without all the pain and issues associated with gluten. Many other products would come out mushy and like oatmeal - but not this one, it tastes so much like ordinary pasta, I cannot tell the difference.<br /><br />I just purchased the ""bionaturae Organic gluten-free pasta"" because the Heartland G.F pasta has increased in price, is frequently out of stock, and no longer participates in the ""Subscribe & Save"" option (for those who aren't aware of this program, it saves you 15% and you can cancel at any time).  The other product mentioned, the Bionaturae pasta gives you 6 packs of spaghetti (rather than 5 included in Heartland) and still costs less when choosing the subscribe & save. The Bionaturae is offered in the subscribe & save and also has great reviews, so we'll see how it turns out. If it doesn't measure up to the heartland then I will just bit the bullet and order the heartland product."
1,"I prepared this pasta according to the package directions, cooking it for 12 minutes.  It was great! I served it to my hubby and my gluten-free daughter who has never had spaghetti as far as she can remember.  Well, she used to eat it when she was three years old until she was diagnosed with celiac.  She loved this pasta.  Now, I'm afraid she can't get enough pasta.  She recently discovered pizza (gluten-free, of course) and now she has it at least once a week.  My hubby didn't realized the Heartland spaghetti was gluten free until I told him.  He thought it was wonderful, as did I.  I will certainly buy it again.  Now, I'm just waiting for it to come back to Amazon, because I don't know what store I bought it locally and don't want to start searching each one."
0,"Bought this after reading all the favorable reviews. The pasta clumped into a massive ball when cooked according to directions. I tried unclumping and rinsing off the ""slime"" as it cooked. When I poured out my pasta what had been an entire pack had turned into about 1/2 cup. So much for a family meal that I could participate in without having to eat special food. I will never buy Heartland products again."
1,"Quite random but I found this pasta by a woman who told me in the gluten free section about how this pasta tastes and doesn't have any sort of gluten-free like texture.  We've bought Tinkyada brand for quite some time and still like the spinach and that bit of gritty texture but Heartland's pasta has been our regular go-to pasta these days.  It's very smooth, can't really tell it's gluten free and cooks fairly quickly.  I'm assuming it's becoming popular as often times we only see few in left at the store so we've decided to just buy them in bulk!  Highly recommended pasts if you miss that traditional starchy gluten pasta :)"
1,This is the best gluten free pasta that i have found in the two and a half years that i have been gluten free. i really enjoy that i can bring it and cook it without it being known that it is gluten free. This tastes almost identical to regular pasta. this is also the cheapest pasta that i have found. i originally found it at a super walmart and the other day i saw it at hannfords which is closer. i love this along with the penne and the fusilli as well. I would recommend this product to anyone who is starting or already been on a gluten free diet.
1,"I had someone visiting that requires a gluten  free diet . I make a mean marinara sauce so I ordered this pasta So that she could try it .  I personally enjoyed it immensely and could not believe it wasn't the real thing . Not only that, but I did not feel full or bloated after two bowls of it. I think I'm going to replace my pasta with this product because it taste so good and feels so good when I'm done eating.  It took exactly the same cooking time as regular pasta and my friend was surprised that the usual gluten free pasta characteristics did not exist with this product Like gooey and stickiness. I would highly recommend this product even if you don't Require the gluten free diet. Another point is as a leftover it was just as good which I understand is not true with Gluten free pasta."
1,This pasta is great for Gluten free! There is no film when cooking it and it tastes no different than wheat pasta. My only regret is the cost when buying it on Amazon. The only other carrier is Super Walmart and there is not one close to me so unless I want to travel for it this is the best alternative.
1,"This is by far the best gluten free spaghetti!  The taste and texture is EXACTLY like regular spaghetti!  You also cook it exactly like regular spaghetti.  Even thought only my 9 year old has Celiacs and cannot eat gluten, we all love Heartland Gluten Free spaghetti and eat it too!  Thank goodnes this product is easily available at Walmart or on Amazon.com!"
0,"I'm trying to eat healthier and I eat a lot of pasta but this is almost inedible. The pasta dissolves in the boiling water and makes a big mushy mess. I tried adding my sauce to it, but the combination is terrible. I won't be purchasing this brand again. I had high hopes."
1,"Great taste, texture, flavor, and works well with any sauce! Wonderful pricing, too! Gluten free products are so expensive normally! Definitely recommend this!"
1,"So greatful for Heartland pastas. They are the best ones I've found! My husband, who does not need to eat gluten free, will enjoy these with me! They are not great for reheating but few things are. Thank you sooooo much!"
1,"Since I have had to go gluten free a year ago, I have missed the taste of ""real"" spaghetti!<br />I have tried nearly all the GF kinds of spaghetti, and though they were alright, they were still not the same.  But I recently bought this, and I thought I was not eating gluten free!  I had to double check the package to make sure I made the right thing!  It was same in texture and taste!  Only I had NO reaction to them like I would a gluten pasta!  It was FABULOUS!<br />I will forever buy only this kind of spaghetti!"
1,"I fixed this pasta a few days ago with a meat sauce, honestly, there was no difference in taste & texture and it warmed up beautifully. My son ate the last of it two days after I made it and he said it was delicious. We don't own a microwave either so he had to warm it in a pan. It held together as well as regular pasta. Found mine at Walmart and the price was reasonable."
1,My husband and I loved this pasta. It was our first experience with gluten free and we really could not tell the difference. In fact it might even have better than regular pasta. Also we didn't have the heartburn that usually accompanies pasta. I am thrilled that I don't have to give up pasta because I can't eat wheat. I highly recommend this product!
1,We were introduced to this brand at a high-end restaurant.<br />The secret is apparently that the primary ingredient in corn rather than rice.<br />No more mushy GF pasta.  Incredible!
1,"The Heartland Gluten Free dried pastas are great....much better than the brand the stores in this area sell.  I've requested them to stock it, but hope to find it available here on Amazon too."
0,"Purchased these noodles when our family was put on a gluten free diet.  Thankful to find a alternative to wheat noodles I can not express my great disapointment.  The noodles became mushy and break down very badly.  While cooking a package for dinner I carefully watched and stirred the noodles as they shrunk in my pan.  In fear that there would not be enough noodles from this one package to feed my famiy of 4 (both of my children a small and do not eat large portions)  I put on a second pot and started cooking an additional bag of pasta.  By the time they were cooked and serve My husband and two chilren received a 1/4 cup of noodles and I received none.  They were gone it was like they shrank.  Not only were there not enough noodles, they were mushy.  I actually took every bag I had left in the pantry and returned them to the store, I have found the Tinkayana brand to be a much better pasta for the gluten free families."
0,"I've tried this a couple of time and both times the noodle just fell apart.  The taste was rather sweet, not like regular pasta.  Now searching for some better pasta substitute."
1,"this is the best cocoa i've had. way better than anything you can find at the supermarket, and even better than the other highly rated cocoas i tried from amazon.. also dissolves in water really easily and makes amazing hot chocolate (you can find recipes online - once you start making it from scratch you'll never buy the pre-mixed stuff again)."
1,"This is one of the few organic & pure cocoa powders out there. The price is competitive comparably. Whenever I am running low, I re-order this terrific product."
1,"I've used it in two cakes that were raved over. The wide mouth top allows easy access for a 1/2 cup measuring cup, less mess.  Neat cocoa is a plus."
1,"Good product and good price.  It seems a bit ""fluffier"" than some other brands and so I wonder if you get less weight by volume.  That said, I'd order this again."
1,"I mix the whey protein isolate with grined un-hulled organic sesame seed, organic flax seed, Now Foods organic cocoa, organic soy milk...  The mix is great without any stories... I used to eat dark chocolate before and now I get all the antioxidants with the sugar and calories in my mix before surfing, weight lifting, mountain biking... Thanks Now Foods."
1,"This cocoa powder is a very good price and it is super tasty! Very rich and chocolaty and I usually put 2 teaspoons in a mug with hot water and I add cinnamon and agave for a touch of sweetness, but it is good alone too. Delicious in smoothies too, I would definitely recommend this product."
1,"It's difficult to find certified organic cocoa products on the market that are not overly-pricey.  Taste & being organic is important to me, but cost is too! This wins all three! I will purchase this brand again, and I plan to purchase it again from Amazon if the price remains this good!"
1,"This Cacao powder is really the best deal you will find. It is not phenomenal in taste but its still really good. I've had better tasting, but as far as the quality goes, im not really sure if the nutrient or antioxidant level between this and others is any better. Like to believe it is the same, especially at the price. Good stuff nonetheless."
1,"wow this is amazing cocoa loved it ,it bakes up like a dream , tastes wonderful there is alot of it . i got it supersaver ,so no shipping,its worth the money"
1,This is wonderful cocoa powder for all your chocolate needs.  It's even more special because it is organic and free of all pesticides and any other harmful chemicals.
1,"This is a very versatile spice and it does add a smoky flavor.  The spice is quality and isnt clumpy or anything like that.  I ordered it because I wanted to make one specific recipe (swiss steak - alton brown), but have experimented on my own where I might want to impart a slight smoky flavor.  Must have in my spice rack from now on."
0,"Kaj's Li Hing King Plum, 22-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)<br /><br />These Plums are hard as a rock. Zero Stars."
1,Extremely pleased with product quality and quantity!!! Great deal!!! Wonderful customer service from seller; promptly replaced lost item when contacted. 5 Star Seller! Will be back for more dried mushrooms in the near future. Thanks for a smooth transaction.
1,"I had bought 2 bags of wood ear mushrooms and I am not sorry, its a lot probably I will be using them for the next 2 years but i like it a lot and I tend to use more than needed because the taste its so awesome. The shipping was fast and I just love the product."
1,I ordered the cloud ear mushroom and the wood ear mushroom at the same time and am happy I did.  These are wonderful for using in just about any receipe that I've tried.<br />When these are about used up I will be ordering more.
1,"My local supermarket sells one ounce bags of dried woodear mushrooms for four dollars.  For a little bit more than twice the price, you get a whole pound.  These are not available fresh.  I boil some water in the microwave and soak the mushrooms for about 20 minutes.  At that point, I use the liquid to fortify my homemade hot and sour soup.  Woodear mushrooms expand a lot when rehydrated so you only need a few.  I find that its easier to crumble them before rehydrating them.<br /><br />Angelina's packs these in a plastic bag inside a cardboard box.  Four boxes fill a carton and save on shipping charges.  I mixed it up and got some <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RHSX9G"">OYSTER MUSHROOMS,(DRIED) 1 lb.</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RHSV5C"">BOLETES, CHILEAN, FIRST QUALITY,(DRIED) 1 lb.</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RHSV02"">BLEND, NORTHWOODS,MUSHROOM(DRIED) 1 lb.</a>.

Bag</a> but I can't justify the high price.<br /><br />I am pleased with all of the products I received from Angelina's and will order again."
1,"Tziganakaya! It was a treasure of flavour. We are pretty good of figuring out ingredients by taste, but this was just Tziganskaya. Delicious but while moderate in price the shipping makes it prohibitive for us. The supermarkets force us all into a center lane of food, which is not bad nor good. This is good, so hard to get."
0,"Each of the different Wat-aah! varieties have themes. I picked up the Power theme at the Natural Foods Expo, and I asked the guy what made it different. He looked a bit stunned, but he pointed out the magnesium in it and then looked at me blankly. That's one of two things wrong with the company's marketing. Everything else is spot on--well, except that they're selling water, and they're selling it to parents who should be making their kids drink water whether they want to or not. But that would require parenting. I digress.<br /><br />The other thing wrong with this product is the label copy. I don't know what the other bottles say, but I'm guessing kids aren't buying this water, so the label copy SHOULD sell the parents rather than the kids, but I would think the parents would reject the water, based on the copy. The copy explains to kids that they should fight to drink this cool Wat-aah! Power instead of spinach, because of the magnesium, which is apparently the only value in spinach. I digress again. The label even says that spinach ""is green and sticks in your teeth"" in comparison to the water that ""comes in a cool bottle."" Right under all of this is a Fight Childhood Obesity logo. Right. So, I'm going to bring something into the house that argues against them eating spinach, AND that helps me fight childhood obesity how? Now, I'm not saying that spinach is the answer, but do I need a company marketing themselves as a substitute for something else that is good for kids? Moreover, how could they think that's a good idea, a selling point to adults with critical thinking skills?<br /><br />Well, apparently they do. This water is marketed based on its cool bottle. But it's just water and some of the usual ""special"" stuff that is often in water we buy. It's also marketed to give kids ""buying power"" with the cartoon front and the spinach argument. Frankly, I'd rather any kid of mine didn't rely on marketing to make a product choice, and oh, guess what: they are kids. They don't get to make the product choices.<br /><br />The company has somehow made the right connections, gotten the right endorsements, achieved school distribution, and is conducting a social media campaign that is textbook perfect. Too bad they're also selling water and the idea that marketing to kids (and marketing to them in a way that doesn't support eating leafy green vegetables) is a good thing. If it wasn't for the mixed message on the copy, maybe I could accept that it's marketing like sugary cereals do: to the kids. But this product just teaches kids that bottled water is good. It's not a horrible lesson, but parents should be teaching their kids through the parents' buying power--not the kids. When they get a job, they can buy spinach-replacing water. And eat their damn spinach."
1,Purchased these for my wedding last month.  We put them in the champagne to give the drinks a pretty decoration and a touch of pink blush.  Worked great!  The flowers themselves are tasty (sort of a raspberry rhubarb flavor) and look really pretty.
1,"These flowers are great with prosecco or champagne poured over them in a glass flute.  I had purchased these in a smaller quantity locally but the ""bulk"" size is a much better value.  They arrived quickly and were as described."
1,"Very lovely flowers, great idea for a wedding shower..... champagne with a hibiscus flower.<br />Could be used for any special occasion.  Would definitely buy this product again."
1,Wonderful product to make high class drinks wow the crowd amaze you guests . It will be the conversation of every table.
1,"These flowers are great for special occasions, or just for a pick me up when you are enjoying your favorite glass of white wine.  They are beautiful and yummy!"
0,"I've tried this out, and honestly it's far more cost effective to pick up some organic (or heck, even regular) peanut butter from the grocery.<br /><br />I find filling the toys up with the peanut butter & freezing them for 10-15 minutes is an ideal way to keep the fur babies busy."
0,"We bought this just to try it out, and ended up throwing it away after attempting to use it once. This stuff is impossible to squeeze out, and the only reason we were finally able to get anything out of it was because we cut part of the bottom off and squeezed out out of there instead. Pointless. Go with the original stuff in a can, or just get natural peanut butter and use a knife to put it in the kong (thats what we use)."
1,My dogs love it and it is so easy to put in their kongs and or whatever. Easy to use and no mess and my babies love love love it:):)
1,It smells like our peanut butter jam just that it's more watery. I used a little inside the kong toy and Dasher loves it. It keeps him occupied for a good 30 minutes
1,"I occasionally use this in her Kong - but unless I do it before hand and freeze it, it gets messy. What I frequently use it for is training - instead of giving little training treats that you have to hold, I squeeze a little paste into her mouth. She goes nuts for it so it works great and not messy at all and I don't have to juggle a bag or treats."
1,"So I've used the stuff in the can and I thought of trying this as I determined it was more economical when I bought it on Amazon.  It's a good product, great for squeezing peanut butter in Kongs, though if you are trying to squirt it all the way to the other end of the Kong, this probably won't do the trick.  It's not as easy to use as the squirt can version.  And yes, I know that just using peanut butter out of a jar would be cheaper, but this is so much faster and easier, and has a more viscous consistency the squeezes well so I can get it into the cracks between the dog treats stuffed in the Kong."
1,The product came in good condition. My dog loves this stuff. It lasts longer when we put a small amount in a Kong and freeze it overnight.
1,"My yorkie is crazy about this peanut butter. We fill his Kong toy up every time we need to leave him in the kitchen and he scarfs it down... The packaging is sturdy, it stays clean and is easy to squeeze out. Great product"
1,"My dog loved this ""peanut butter"" treat, but I put too much inside her Kong toy and it made her vomit.  Just use a tiny amount until you see how your dog's tummy tolerates it."
0,These nuts were not fresh at all.  I'd give them 0 stars if I could.  I should have known given they sit in a warehouse till they get bought.  Definitely stay away from them.  I would have returned them but we opened them already.
1,Got them today.  All seem to be great mature natural almonds.  They are not salted or flavored so should be a healthy snack.  I didn't realize how many there would be.  I poured them into sealable containers because they are going to be around for a while.
1,"I love to order this 5 lb bag.  I keep it in the fridge.  Not one bad nut in the bunch.  They are great right out of the bag, but I like to brown them in a cast iron pan with a little butter, cinnamon & Splenda.  I add some of Azar's unsalted macadamias too.  In moderation, these make a nice low carb snack.  My last order was on 2/21/11, it is now 4/04/11 and I am out of almonds.  Waiting for them to come back in stock to re-order."
1,Was pleasantly surprised to find out not only were theses almonds fresher and better tasting than all the supermarkets and health stores I usually buy them but fast shipping and prompt follow up.
1,"great when roasted for 10-15 minutes at 350 degrees!... don't overdo the roasting...roasting provides a great taste, reduces the moisture content and sweetens the flavor"
1,"I bought these for almond milk.  Best price I've found.  They were fresh when I got them.  I store them in the freezer or fridge. They keep for months.  Do wish they were organic, though."
0,These nuts arrived quickly and were well packaged however are very stale with no crunch. Our family of nut lovers will not touch them and they are just sitting while all the other nuts in the house are gone in a flash. A terrible waste!
1,"I work as a swim instructor at an elementary school and classes are back to back with no time for breaks. I needed a quick healthy snack while I work so I thought about buying these almonds and eat a handful with an orange when I felt hungry. The almonds came in today in a clear bag and tasted great. I know some reviewers said they weren't fresh but they taste really fresh to me. I had an empty 5lb container of protein laying around my room and washed it out and poured all the almonds in there. Almonds are the perfect snack, has protein, carbs, and some healthy fats. Will be buying again."
1,These almonds arrived in a clear plastic bag and every almond was perfect.  I transfered most to a vacuum container to preserve freshness. I will reorder from this company.
1,"I first ordered these almonds a couple months ago and was very pleased with the product.  When it came time to order more, I unfortunately went with another supplier that was running a sale. The other company's product was stale and taste was off, and I couldn't wait to get through the other almonds so I could order from Azar again.  Now just ordered my 3rd bag and couldn't be happier with the quality.  Bag is easily vacuum resealed with a Food Saver if you have one."
1,"The almonds arrived quickly, nice big bag of good fresh almonds.  Lots go into brownies, and a few days back I put some in fruitcakes, one of which we are already eating and is very tasty!"
0,"First time ordering almonds from internet.  I would say about 80% of the almonds are very stale, they do not taste fresh at all"
1,These almonds are just wonderful!  Very fresh and crisp.  They are the perfect addition to the trail mix I am making.  They are a great snack too.
1,"This Product arrived on time.<br />The quality was better than what I would get at the local grocery store(s), and price better that them of course.<br />Would buy again"
1,"There are a lot of nuts in this bag.  They are good.  Bought from Amazon and I didn't have any bad ones.  I ate on them for days until I finally got so sick of almonds that I threw the rest in the trash.  I probably had 80% of the bag left.  It has been about 6 months and I never want to see another almond again.  5 Stars, but I won't buy again."
1,My son truly enjoys this product.  He is 17 and has a cup of french vanilla every day prior to school.  He likes the sublt vanilla flavor.  I am not a flwvored coffee drinker but this one has lured me away a few times.  Good stuff. Could have a stronger coffee flavor  for my liking
1,"I am normally a dark coffee fan but on occasion I have a hankering for a flavored cup of coffee.  I keep trying new ones that sound really good, but I am almost always disappointed, and realize that I'm not really a fan of flavored coffee.  There are two flavored coffees I keep coming back to however and this is one (the other Sugar Bush Maple).  Great vanilla flavor and aroma and still tastes like coffee.  This is always on my reorder list."
1,"This is very pleasant, smooth coffee flavor with a hint of vanilla.  Not bitter.  I do happen to like Van Houtte French Vanilla slightly better.  Be aware that all pods have a 6 month shelf life, so don't buy too much all at one time, like I did."
1,"I was very pleased with this French Vanilla product. Typically with the flavored coffee, I tend to like Hazelnut but this French Vanilla is awesome!"
1,"We have bought many french vanilla coffees and any other coffee that have vanilla in it. I have to say, this is one of our favorites. Of course, I am not a ""purest"" coffee drinker. Sorry, I add creamer and sugar. The International Delight French Vanilla Creamer increases the natural vanilla taste of this coffee. We tried other vanilla coffees with ""vanilla supreme"" in their names but they were supremely lacking compared to Timothy's product. No chemical or tangy after taste with this one."
1,"This is a good cup of coffee.  It has a light NATURAL vanilla flavor.  It is smooth with no bitter aftertaste.  Far Superior to Gloria Jean's French Vanilla.  I would have given it 5 stars if the vanilla flavor was a tad stronger.  It truly only has a ""Hint"" of vanilla."
1,"I like flavored coffees, but don't want the flavoring to overwhelm the coffee.  This has a nice balance."
0,"Has a good taste but its so weak even when brewed on the small cup setting. Generally, i find Starbucks coffees to be too strong and Duncan Donuts to be too weak. My preference is somewhere in between. Unfortunately, these Timothy's k-cups just taste like water."
1,"THIS IS A GOOD COFFEE FOR THOSE OF US THAT DON'T LIKE THAT HARSH, DARK, HAIR RAISING, CREOSOTE TASTING BLEND. NOT LIKE GLORIA JEANS, OR STARBUCKS... THIS IS MILDER, NOT SO ACIDIC.  I BREW IT IN THE MEDIUM CUP SETTING IN MY KEURIG, AND IT COMES OUT RIGHT. THE LARGE CUP SETTING MAKES IT TOO WEAK. ENJOY!"
1,"One of my fav. k-cups, tastes more like regular coffee though (but a little better than regular.)"
1,This is one of my favorite flavors.  This French vanilla tastes better than Gloria Jean and van heutte
0,I tried a few of these then threw the rest away. Timothy's regular coffee is good but the flavored coffee is terrible
1,"I think this has a nice vanilla flavor. not too strong, but good. Even my husband, who doesn't like flavored coffee, likes this. Also great with vanilla syrup added~"
1,I like the coffee and purchasing on Amazon.  I wish we could purchase single boxes of flavors we would like to try instead of two packs.
1,I have a Keurig coffee maker in my classroom. Dropping in a French Vanilla K-Cup and knowing that in a few seconds that warm French Vanilla Coffee aroma will be filling my classroom is great. Not a heavy coffee taste just a pleasant cup that I can enjoy.
0,"very diappointing flavor.  I thought Timothys made fine coffees, but skip this one.  You might as well get unflavored coffee, since you can't taste any vanilla in this one.  I am trying another brand next time- Gloria Beans, perhaps?"
0,"I love Timothy's coffee pods, so when I bought a Keurig, naturally I bought Timothy's.  I bought two flavored coffees but they are way too bold and strong for a morning coffee drinker.  I am now trying Gloria Jean, Emeril and Caribou, looking for a pleasant morning cup.  I may consider opening up the K-cups to see if I can dump the contents into a toddy maker, I hate to toss these, but find them unpleasantly harsh."
1,These little k-cups have me drinking more coffee than ever...two in the morning...one at lunch and one in the evening...almost every day. It is definitely my favorite of the k-cups I've tried.
0,"After using French Vanilla creamer in other coffees, I made the jump to French Vanilla coffee.  What a mistake.  Definitely not the same.  Not even close.  This coffee is weak and the french vanilla flavor is barely noticeable to me.  Ended up pitching the rest and going with that amazing Italian Blend, also by Timothy's."
1,I am addicted....this coffee is great.<br />We are on subscribe and save and go through about 4-6 boxes a month.<br />Everyone in my home enjoys this flavor and thus there is no need for another.<br /><br />Its a medium bodied coffee and the flavor is perfect.<br />I dont know what else I could say about it...but the price at Amazon is perfect and subscribe and save gets you some additional savings.<br /><br />Try it out...you wont be disappointed!
1,Title says it all.<br />Quality control seems to be a bit better than the Green Mountain stuff. At least I have not run into any cups that leak their grounds with Timothy's as I have with GM.
1,"Timothy's World Coffee, French Vanilla, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 25-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)<br />This is my absolute favorite K-cup!"
1,"Although my favorite k-cup so far is the Butter Toffee, this is the 2nd place Runner-up.  It's got a great flavor and is sweet enough that you won't need to add sweetner."
1,"My husband is the tea drinker in our household. I love my coffee.  Timothy's tea is his favorite. Having our Keurig has really made a big difference for us in being able to have the drink we want and not having the aftertaste of the other when we brew a cup.<br />I highly recommend The Keurig and Timothy's K-cups in the tea as well as the coffee flavors.<br />My mother is getting a Keurig from my sister and me for her 73rd birthday this month.<br />If you purchase, sign up for the automatic shipments.  It is much cheaper and the boxes are 24 count. The boxes at a local store are only 18 count boxes."
0,"Nespresso makes GREAT coffee and GREAT machines. I switched over to a Nespresso machine 7 years ago and have never looked back. I save a small fortune every year by making my lattes at home.<br /><br />That being said, the Nespresso capsule offers posted here are from a third party who is putting a large additional margin on their price.<br /><br />You can order the same products online from Nespresso for approx $0.55 each (half the price here)."
1,This coffee is the best i have had in a long time.  It is so good that it keeps me out of local coffee shops.  I am hooked.
1,We have been using the Char Crust rubs for years. They are the best dry rubs on the market!!!
1,"""Bounty"" bars consist of a soft, almost molten center of sweet coconut coated in an outer layer of milk chocolate. You can easily buy them ""over the counter"" here in Australia. But if that's not the case where you are, and you don't mind a diet rich in junk food, then yes, this is a candy bar worth going to the trouble of ordering over the internet.<br /><br />Note that here on Amazon you can purchase bounty bars in boxes with varying numbers of bars inside, so it is worth your while to crunch the numbers and think about what package offers the best value for you. At the same time, it may not be entirely in the best interests of your health to have _too_ many of these things lying around at home all at once!<br /><br />Theo."
0,"Amazon sent the wrong product. Received regular Mars chocolate bars. Also had an expiration date which had expired.  I was really surprised that Amazon would ship expired food.  Amazon is in the process of sending me the Mars Bounty Coconut bars that I originally ordered. Hope I get the right order this time. I will let you know when it arrives if it is the right item. It seems their packaging recently has been really poor, with no protective packaging on the product, or the wrong product altogether. I order a lot from Amazon and am a Prime customer. Don't know where their priorities are right now. Amazon used to be so reliable ..."
1,We are so glad that we can order Bounty Bars through Amazon-used have to get them in Canada. Thanks-we love them and service was fast.
0,I love bounty and the one star is not for Bounty but for Amazon.<br />The first shipment they sent me had expired 2 months before.<br />The replacement shipment I got though it didn't expire till 11-11-2011; It might as well have been. They were dried and flaky. I didn't bother even returning them. I usually order though 3rd party sellers but I got greedy with the free shipping and sacrificed quality.<br />I've never had issues with Amazon products but this one really dissapointed me.<br />No need to contact me Amazon. I'll still shop with you I just won't be buying Bounty directly from Amazon for now.
1,"This dried beef makes great creamed chipped beef. One can buy it in supermarkets in Philadelphia, or in Maryland and Delaware, but not apparently here in Connecticut. (I guess the managers here suppose not enough people would know what to do with it.) However, on the Amazon.com site a shipment costs nearly $120 plus almost $25 shipping. That must be one hell of a lot of product! Too bad it can't be bought in, say, lots of 10 of the small packages (about 5 oz. each) as they are sold in supermarkets. What retail customer not doing a fund-raiser is going to want that much?"
1,"First and foremost, I cannot stress how important it is to feed your cat an all canned food diet - cats do not have a drive for thirst, so only a canned food diet will keep them correctly hydrated [diabetes, urine crystal free].<br /><br />Important to learn: if you feed your cat all wet diet, they only need to drink 1oz of water a day to keep fully hydrated.  If you feed your cat an all dry diet, they need to drink 7oz of water to keep hydrated.  That's a full cup of water!<br /><br />Second, cat food must be high in protein, high to low in fat [depending if you want your cat to be lean], and have no more than 10% carbs.  Dry foods are 30% plus percent carbs. Diabetes is rampant in older cats, and it's recommended to keep their carb intake at 5-10%.<br /><br />You should feed grain-free diet and feed meat from feathered birds, not beef, never fish.  Grain free almost always means high fat, so be careful if you want to keep your cats lean and healthy.<br /><br />I feed this Fancy Feast formula, plus Merrick's cowboy cookout or grammy pot pie [grain free, low fat], plus wellness turkey and chicken formulas [grain free, low protein, high fat].  I use Fancy Feast to entice the cat then they eat whatever else is in their dish [wellness, etc].  Grain free food, while great for them, doesn't really taste great.<br /><br />This formula is:<br />56% protein<br />33% fat<br />10% carbs<br />74 calories per can"
1,"My kitty loves all of these flavors.  This one especially looks-- and even almost smells-- like people food.  I mix in a tablespoon or two of water to be sure she's hydrated, and down it all goes!  Amazon's price with Subscribe and Save is the best I've found."
1,I don't gag when I open Elegant Medleys like I do when  I open other brands. This cat food actually looks appealing too. My cats won't eat anything else.
0,"In the past, I have never had any problems getting the correct order.  However, I ordered 2 cases of Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys Tender Turkey Primavera.  Instead, I received 8 boxes of the Primavera Medleys. This contains three different kinds of cat food one of which is fish.  I have a cat that is prone to bladder infections anytime she eats fish.  Normally, I would return an order that wasn't correct.  However, my cat is hungry and would like to eat!!  So I have 12 cans of wasted cat food.  When I reviewed my order, I discovered that this company was under review for problems with orders.  Thanks, Amazon.  I would have liked to have known that before I ordered this product from you again!!!!!!!!  :("
1,"Tender Turkey Primavera is by far the most favorite of our 4 indoor & 1 outdoor cats. We have tried almost EVERY cat food out there & end up donating those cat foods to  our local Humane Society. BUT, this is one of the foods that they adore & will never turn their noses up to!"
0,I tried everything to make these sprout. Inside. Outside. Soil. Plastic cup method. Even one of those jiffy plant starters. Nothing seems to work
1,"This might be my new favorite flavor of Cape Cod Chips.  The combination of rosemary, feta, and garlic tastes terrific.  None of the flavors overpower each other.  The only bad thing is that the bag is only 7 oz, whereas standard Cape Cod Chip bags are 8 oz."
1,"I absolutely love Chicago-style cheese and caramel popcorn like Garrett's.  So, feeling a craving for the stuff, I decided to try this gourmet cheddar cheese popcorn.  It was delicious, but very salty.  The cheese is also not the same quality of stuff that they use in the better Chicago popcorn shops.  Frankly, it didn't taste as cheesy and a bit fake.  The popcorn itself was quite fresh though.<br /><br />All in all, I guess if you're desperate for some gourmet-esque popcorn, this stuff is good.  However, in my book, it doesn't compare to the real, fresh gourmet popcorn shops' stuff."
1,"I received a bag of this kettle corn over the holidays and found it to be quite delicious, crisp, and flavorful.  It is the plain variety (Zebra?) and I highly recommend it."
0,"I tried the variety pack of the popconopolis from Amazon. Really liked all of it except for the cheese. For my taste the cheese was way too salty. If you thought Cheese Doodles gave you orange fingers, you should have seen my fingers after eating some of this. The coating seemed to be a fine powder that really caked onto my fingers. Also, with this one cone the popcorn had no crunch...seemed stale. Maybe this was just a bad or outdated cone. I love my junkfood, but actually threw away a small portion of the cone. One of those things I asked myself, why did I eat that much? I wasn't enjoying it."
1,"We fell in love with Popcornopolis when we first tried it at a Blockbuster store... however the price<br />was pretty steep for the small cone that you got... so I looked it up on Amazon and lo and behold here<br />it be!  This popcorn is unreal... if you like pecans and caramel popcorn you will LOVE this. I still<br />have a hard time figuring out how they make it so good but whatever they are doing they are doing it<br />right!  It is fresh and crunchy - PERFECT for a late night snack and a cuppa decaf coffee, feels like<br />you are eating something super sinful yet it isn't too bad for ya.<br />Can't beat the price either! I sent this to my mother in law as her mothers day gift and she was super<br />thrilled - she actually hinted to us that she wanted this because we had sent them a 5 pack sampler and<br />this one was her favorite.<br />She said she hid them where noone else can find them.<br />Hope this review helps.... I am also in hopes that the chocoloate zebra will be available on Amazon too...<br />That one is amazing as well  :0)<br />PS: The cheese one is softer and kind of stale even though the flavor IS something to write home about -<br />don't get it unless you don't mind it stale-ish. Also the husks can get annoying in the cheese kind."
1,Popcornopolis Cheddar Popcorn through Amazon is just as good as if you bought it directly in the store.  The vacuum sealed bags keep the popcorn fresh.  Great price and fast shipping.  I highly recommend for cheese popcorn lovers.  It is the best I've tasted.
1,"It's the first time buying a popcorn on-line @ Amazon.<br />I only like the caramel flavor, but the one that sells in Costco always comes with 3 different flavors, so I was thinking on going to the stores, and buy it there, till' I saw it at Amazon.<br />The arriving date was way too far, but after they confirmed the order, I got it in 2 days! I was happy, coz' I wanted to have this before mothers day, and I think is a very good price.<br /><br />I surely recommended!! ^.^"
1,If you love cheese popcorn this is absolutely the best you'll ever taste! I've tried many and none come close in rich cheesy flavor
1,"This is our favorite popcornopolis flavor, but its a shame they don't seem as fresh as they should.  In fact they were kind of stale, but they were still good!"
1,"High quality, attractively packaged caramel popcorn. We give this to many friends and it is always a much appreciated gift. You can't go wrong on this purchase.  Fast shipping as always."
1,"I received a bag of the Popcornopolis Cinnamon Toast Popcorn as a Christmas gift.  By the next day, I had finished the bag and was on Amazon to order more of the popcorn.  The packaging is adorable, but the flavor is OH SO GOOD!  It's perfectly crunchy and cinnamony and not too sweet.  Next year, Santa is getting Popcornopolis and milk on Christmas Eve."
1,"I sent this to my son for a snack during finals week.  It didn't arrive as scheduled, so he didn't have it for finals week.  He was finally able to pick it up today as the mail room on campus was closed for winter break.  It was a nice surprise and he had plenty to share with his friends, thank goodness it didn't spoil.  I would order this item again, but I would request a different means of delivery."
1,"This would probably seem like too much popcorn to buy, but it's a great gift. My friends and family loved it. It taste amazing! This is a great deal on this popcorn too. I will be buying this again."
1,"They have some of the best cheese and caramel popcorn I've had, and buying here at Amazon with free shipping means that on a per bag basis, its not anymore expensive than what I would pay at the local grocery store for a type that is not as tasty."
1,These are really good especially if you get a fresher batch.  You can tell as you're eating  them that it can't be good for your body but that won't stop you from popping one after another down the hatch.
1,"I totally love this popcorn.  I first had it at Universal City Walk in LA and thought it was terrific.  I've tried a few flavors and decided their Caramel and Cheddar Cheese (both white and regular) are for me, the best flavors.  The caramel is much better than any of the others I've tried at my local grocery."
1,This tastes the way I remember caramel popcorn tasting.  Highly recommend this for old-fashioned caramel corn fans.  It's actually a lot of popcorn.
1,It is by FAR the Cheesiest popcorn ever!<br />I signed up for auto shipments every 3 months and my husband and I can<br />eat a bag (4.5oz) in one sitting when at the movies or at home watching a movie!
1,This the very rich and cheesy popcorn.  I love cheese popcorn and have tried many different kinds but this is the best popcorn by far.  Try a bag for yourself.
1,A co-worker brought this popcorn to share.  We couldn't believe how good is was!  He finds it at Costco.  I don't have time to shop stores so I immediately went to Popcornopolis.com and placed an order for a variety of flavors.  Everything was awesome!  I'm a frequent Amazon shopper but just today thought to search for it here.  Amazon offers it much cheaper but the selection is limited.  Don't hesitate to try this popcorn!
1,This is great tasting popcorn... First tried it at our local blockbuster DVD store but then went direct to the Popcornopolis website and ordered direct - the big cones.  At Blockbuster and direct from Popcornopolis it was fresh and crunchy but for some odd reason this tasted a bit stale from the very first.  The flavor is amazing and just a large handful will satisfy that salty craving but it may be a bit stale if u get it from amazon... I do highly recommend Popcornopolis though... It IS the BEST popcorn you can get and we've tried a lot! The pecan and zebra is unreal too.  I recommend giving it a try at your local blockbuster first then their direct website. They have a nice array of yummy addicting flavors - we've gotten many many friends and family addicted to it and it makes a great gift if shipped direct from Popcornopolis- they have neat packages.  (by the way... The candied ones tend to be fresher from the beginning and last a long time!)
1,"I consider myself a foodie and am always trying to find the best of everything.  I tried Dale and Thomas popcorn when it was one of Oprah's favorite things and yes, it was good.  My local Costco store had the Popcornopolis people in-store for a few days and I was IMPRESSED.  The zebra (white and dark chocolate drizzled) was really great but the cheddar was like none other I have ever tasted.  WOW.  It has to be good if it says ""Why is this popcorn so good?"" on the back of the bag with an explanation.  Oh and two thumbs up for the perfectly sized, individually sealed cones.  I can eat one cone in one sitting (and they aren't tiny!) and can stop there.  It is a good limit-setter.  :)"
1,Sweet and tasty popcorn delivered to your door.  It's a slam dunk every time.  This popcorn is off the hook.  It is expensive unless you find a deal like on amazon!!  Go for it..
1,"This is great popcorn and amazon has it on sale for a great price, they even delivery it.  Ain't America GREAT!"
1,I love this popcorn.  Super fast shipping and fresh popcorn.  But I wouldn't spend the extra money for almonds next time.  The regular caramel popcorn is better and is less expensive.
1,I purchase this popcorn at Costco every chance I get.  I was glad to see it at amazon for such a great price.  This popcorn is always very good and fresh.<br />The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because my favorite cheese popcorn is a little more cheesy and stickier.
1,"This is by far the best cheese popcorn I have ever eaten. My husband is addicted to this stuff! Always fresh, really flavorful, WOW!"
0,"I ordered this popcorn and in the past have loved it, but this time ordering it for the first time from amazon I was highly disatisfied!! We got it and it was so stale that even my 2 year old would not eat it and he will eat anything. A customer guarentee came with the popcorn so we called and were told that because we ordered through amazon we were not able to get a refund or a fresh product. Never again will I order anything of this nature through amazon."
0,"When we searched for Garretts popcorn, it came up but what Amazon attempted to send me is not Garrett's Popcorn, but some Popcornolopis brand that I have no idea of.  I could spend 70 bucks at a local popcorn shop if I wanted popcorn other than Garrett's.  I don't understand the advertising it as Garretts,,,,wonder if Garrett's knows this?  Ummmmm"
0,"I just bought the Zebra flavor after sampling at a holiday booth. The sample had chocolate drizzled on each piece.  False representation. The actual bag contains few pieces with chocolate. (less than 10& of pieces have chocolate) It looks and tastes like Crunch 'n Munch or Cracker Jacks.  If you're looking for gourmet popcorn, this is not it."
1,We use this on fish also. It is a great seasoning and is a low cal solution to a great meal.
0,I enjoy several of the Shake and Bake crusts and the Ranch and Herb Crusted one is by far the worst.  My wife and I put it on chicken and it was terrible.  Do not buy this item.
1,"I have made yogurt on and off for years and this is by far the easiest way. I highly recommend this. No advance planning, muss or fuss required. I start it before I go to work in the morning. It only takes 3 minutes to make the yogurt from my end, the longest part is waiting for the water to boil for the container. Very quick and very easy! When I come home it is done and all I have to do is refrigerate it for the next morning. The yogurt is delicious and I've even made my own yogurt (from scratch) and it worked well. There are web sites that tell you how, if you are interested in doing this. The packets usually come in groups of 3 and are available on line or in stores. It is new to the USA so unfortunately, not many stores are carrying it as yet. I think that will change as people discover how great this system it and how delicious and fresh the yogurt is. Hopefully (Hint to Easiyo) they will sell the packets individually too.  Really, I love this product."
1,"My son sent me this yogurt maker for my birthday form Australia.  It is great!  Takes minutes to follow the directions to make a quart of yogurt.  the Easiyo probiotic yogurt base is great, too.  Best greek style yogurt you want to eat."
1,"I first came into contact with the EasiYo yogurt maker staying with friends for a month in NZ. I could not believe how easy it was to make yogurt and it was better than any yogurt that I had tasted before!! I bought the maker while in NZ and only four packets of the low fat greek to bring home. I thought that of course I could find it in the USA and my local health food store knew what I was talking about. The owner has one too and has tried to get a francise to carry it in her store to no avail. Bad NZ! It would make it so much easier to enjoy. Anyway as I said it's so easy to make, so delicious and smooth to eat, that anyone that likes yogurt, I guarantee you'll love this product. Hopefully NZ will let go and allow it to be carried in the USA!!"
1,"I actually found this yogurt maker in a thrift store in Auckland last year.  I wasn't sure at the time if I was making a good decision, because it took up a LOT of room in my suitcase to get it back to the States.  But, oh my gosh -- I love this thing.  First, making the yogurt is so easy, and the Easiyo packets are the best.  The yogurt is *very* creamy, and just so fresh when it's homemade.  It's those NZ cows!  Second, I love not having all the additional sugars in my yogurt.  Third -- it is cheaper than buying yogurt in the store!  I actually use some of the yogurt from the batch I make to use as starter for the next batch.  So, one packet of yogurt actually makes two batches for me.  Just delicious--- you will love it!!  In NZ, my friend made meringues, added dollops of yogurt and fresh fruit -- just the best dessert ever!"
1,"If only the jar inside were not plastic, which makes me nervous, especially with boiling water potentially leaching toxic compounds.  But a quart glass jar will break from the shock of the difference between the cold contents and boiling water.  If you try to use warm water to prevent the glass from breaking, warm, 95 F water added to the starter causes it to gel into lumps.  This will help prevent the jar from breaking, and the yogurt turns out okay, but after that, when you transfer a quarter cup for the next batch and add milk, you'd better not heat the milk up too hot, keep an eye on it.<br /><br />One of the reasons I bought this yogurt maker was that it was less of a hassle and used less energy, but the workaround to avoid the plastic container is a bit annoying.  Wish they made a metal jar, if that's possible..."
1,"I bought this Item back in the middle of February, and I love it. This Yogurt taste like a dream, the only bad thing I been unable to find where to purchase replacement. And who buys something for it to collect dust right, perhaps if I would have known that it wasn't going to be that easy to buy replacements I properly would have not bought it!!!"
1,great product but a little over priced  30 $ maybe but 40 was a little over the top  whoops  not to mention ocean spray concentrate from the Philippians
0,This price is a rip-off.  Check your local Sam's club and get the same can for $31.00.  That's over $170 more a year.  Why pay it?
0,"I am used to the excellent ketchup popcorn seasoning from Canada. I tried this instead for a change. Big mistake. One use and it was in the trash. Tastes like burnt seasoning, no ketchup flavor at all."
1,"I recently discovered Frank's sauces, and I love them, even if I can't find them in Italy. Lovely, hot but not only hot and full bodied."
1,Perfect for last minute food ideas because you just picked your veggies from your garden. Wonderful product.
1,"In getting ready for Christmas, I find that this is a great way to start and get my dates in larger quantities, with a great price and free shipping. Dates are fresh and chopped just the way I wanted."
1,"these hansen's strawberry banana smoothis drinks are so delicious. I grab one for breakfast, and I'm good to go, its almost like liquid fruit"
1,Mixes well with bananas and strawberries added for extra flavor and texture. Added some frozen vanilla yogurt and made an out of this world drink. I recommend putting in the refrigerator overnight to chill well before mixing for a cold flavorful smoothie.
1,I have ordered from Omaha Steaks for several years now and I have nothing but PRAISE for this company.<br />We only had a problem 1 time and they let us keep the extra order! I've never heard of that.<br />They are a Great company and we will continue to order from them regularly.<br /><br />A PLUS A PLUS A PLUS A PLUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Mike & Linda
1,"I gave these to my husband for Christmas, and we had them over the holidays.  They were sooo tender and juicy!  They arrive so quickly. I am always thrilled with Omaha steaks.  Thanks for such a wonderful product!"
1,"Thought we had good steaks where I live, but these are superior. Would definitely buy them again, well-packaged, great tasting product, exactly what I thought I would get, I did get...this company is famous for a reason."
1,"Even though this product arrived with a broken spray bottle, it works great. I spilled a little outside trying to get the sprayer to work and ultimately ended up transferring it to another bottle I had layout around the house. It smells awful, but works great. Even the area where I spilled it has been squirrel free, so the birds have been free to enjoy the feeders without squirrels stealing the food. This stuff works great, and is all-natural and rated for organic gardening, which I was thrilled about too, since I make a point not to spray chemicals on my lawn."
1,"I don't know how well it works to repel deer and rabbits, as I've used it for 5+ years to keep the squirrels from eating my flowers and plants.  I use it every spring as my perenniels and bulbs appear.  Be sure to shake it well before applying."
0,I purchased 2 bottles of this stuff to keep squirrels out of my corn garden.  Sprayed it around the garden as well as directly onto the ears of cord.  The squirrels destroyed my garden in a matter of days AFTER I applied this product.
1,It Works !!!  A pesky squirrel was draining my hummingbird feeders every day. I bought Deer Off and sprayed the feeders and the tree branches they hang on.  No more squirrels. They'll come in my yard but stay clear of the tree. Its been 2 weeks and we've had some heavy rain storms and its still working. The great thing too is that the hummingbirds are not bothered by the spray.  I am extremely impressed with this product. It's nice to buy something that works great.
0,"I just saw a rabbit next to the plants that were sprayed 3 weeks ago.<br />In the label, it is claimed that it works for 90 days... well it did not even worked for 21..."
0,I read the instructions.  Followed every letter.  Kept the new growth sprayed.  Either rabbits or squirrels still ate my rose bushes.
0,"I used this products to repel the squirrel that eat all my fruits.  They take a bite of each fruit, and then go on to the next one. I used the product around the plant, on the trunk, limbs, on the cables on the way to the tree. They keep going with their normal life, unaffected by the liquid.  They keep on climbing up and down and eating the fruits.  THIS PRODUCTS DOESN'T WORK."
0,"Used it to try and deter squirrels from around my bird feeder.  Didnt work at all, even after 3 sprayings."
0,"I sprayed ""Deer Off"" on and around our bird feeder and within a few hours the squirrels did not hesitate to have a feast with the bird seed I had just put in. Maybe this product works with deer (with which we've never had a problem) but it didn't work with the ""tree rodents"". Save your money !"
0,"Wish I could say this was a good investment, but it lasted two days before the creatures came back and I saw them digging in my garden. The Deer off may be Dear Off but not Squrriel Off."
0,I used this product to try to deter squirrels from a bird feeder.  It did NOTHING!!!  Total waste of money!
1,The Inglehofer Cranberry Mustard is a delightful balance between sweet and spicy. It is perfect for turkey and mixed with diet mayonnaise in chicken salad. The tiny size jar is perfect for stocking stuffers or hostess gifting. I would like a larger size for everyday use.
1,"I have two Jack Russell Terriers and they simply love Bully Sticks!  We have ""bone day"" on Saturday mornings and this is the bone they have come to love and to expect each Saturday morning.  The only thing that buyers should be aware of is the ""regular"" bully stick is really, really skinny.  My two medium breed dogs finish them in about 5 minutes.  In my past purchases of Bully Sticks from other retailers, I have come to expect that ""regular"" size is more like about a 1/2"" to 3/4"" in diameter.  These regular ValueBull Bully Sticks are more like 1/4"" to 1/2"" in diameter and I probably would not have considered them to be such a ""value"" had this size been established.  They are however, 6"" in length.  The dogs still love them, but this was not the deal I thought I was getting."
0,"I ordered these for my dog and they just seem to get smaller and smaller. Better off with ""Best Bully Sticks"""
0,If you are talking ounces you would be better off getting a 12 pack for 19.99 at petsmart. These are tiny. They are only as big as a pencil in diameter one way. They are flat and about half pencil size the other. I do not even know if they are truely pizzle sticks as the ingredients only say beef chews. I personally never saw a cow with a pizzle this small! Must be calf ones.<br />I have small dogs so I am sure they will love them. They did come on time and were boxed appropriately. But for $50.00 it is not worth the price! As a shopper for dog treats for over 30 years these are worth about $25-$30.00 if you compare to whats out in the regular pet stores. Won't purchase again.
0,Not pleased with size of bullysticks. Very small & skinny. Will go back to previous vendor. Bullysticks are usually bigger and thicker. At least the ones I've gotten in the past. This time we tried a new vendor...
0,"Very few of the sticks are the actual size shown. Many of them were as wide as a straw! It took my dog less than 1 minute to chew it up (the Regular size ones take him 15 minutes). Also, they were of all different widths - nowhere near as consistent as shown in the picture. A complete waste of $$."
1,It is nice to be able to give my maltese these pizzle sticks. She was unable to chew some of the larger ones. It is nice to be able to pick the right width for the different size dogs.
1,My three little dogs love these. The price is great and shipping is fast. Having 3dogs and a cat saving on quality products is important. And by the way my cat likes to lick on them too!
0,"Some of the bully sticks were a little bigger than drinking straws.There was no value here.Some of them had a smell.I will never buy from this store again.My Corgi would eat the small bully sticks in about five minutes.All bully stick vendors should have the weight on the package,that would help in determining value.Most of them have the count."
1,"This is my absolute favorite coffee and Brown & Jenkins does it right! Rich, full-bodied, smooth...a pleasure to brew every morning. And I'm happy to support a great small business who gives so much back to their local Vermont community."
1,"I've always been a fan of crystals in the litterbox, and the fact that these are scented really is great!  My basement does not smell like cat, while at the same time, the smell is not so strong that my cat refuses to go in the litterbox.  My cat must use the litterbox more than others, because I've never had the experience of one bag lasting a month.  It lasts two weeks (non-scented used to be 10 days).<br /><br />They are also pretty good at not tracking all over the place.<br /><br />I use the subscribe & save option to make this even cheaper, but I found that it was already 20% less than 7 lbs of ""high quality"" crystals  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HWE6F0"">Ultra Pet Cat Litter Pearls (Original) Crystal Clear, 7-Pound Package</a> and not too much more expensive than the bulk stuff <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ML1OK"">Clear Choice Silica Crystals Cat Litter Pail, 12-Pound</a>."
1,"Target no longer sells my most economical and favorable cat crystals, however, though these are about a 3rd more expensive, my cats love it and so do I. Odors are kept to a minimum and clean up is fairly simple. It will never be a pleasurable task, but, my cats rarely go a day without having their litter box cleaned."
1,"This set was (and is) very handy for specialty cakes, and the colors are just what I was looking for.  Nice and bright, works great with ""electronic"" gadget cakes (xbox, cell phone, etc.) makes them look like they're all powered up.  Great with airbrush--little bit goes a long way, but also works well for painting on tiny details.  This set would be great for anyone looking to take their cakes to the next level."
1,"My puppy has a delicate digestive tract.  We were constantly cleaning up diarrhea until we got her on the Wellness Lamb and Sweet Potato.  Since then she hasn't been sick and at 1 year old she is full of pep and energy, healthy looking coat and no more sickness.  This  has truly been a 5 star food for our dog."
1,I tried this on a whim at the local health food store. I am completely enamored with the product.  I serve it with Bosc pears and it has been a hit.  The crisp sweet of the pear with the tangy and creamy taste of the chocolate goat cheese is a marvelous opposing match. I give the cheese high marks as a dessert cheese. Others must like it where I live because I have to reserve the log or logs before they are sold out.
1,This is pretty neat. The first taste is cocoa (not chocolate) with fresh curd but than the goat cheese flavor kicks in and gives a very different aftertaste. Quite enjoyable.
1,"After having been diagnosed with a thyroid nodule, which later turned out to be cancer, I thought I had better try to get more iodine in my and my family's diet.  After researching some, I found that Dulse is a great natural source of iodine.  I tried a package of this, and found that it is pretty good.  The package came with a suggestion to stir-fry it a few minutes in a hot skillet, to make it like ""chips"", which I tried.  I and my family enjoyed it much better that way.  The quality of this dulse is great, and the price seemed comparable with others I could find.  I ordered more of this, and am using it as a regular supplement to our diet."
1,"I started eating this about a year ago after reading how healthy sea vegetables are for you.  I add it to many different dishes.. the ones listed above, eggs, casseroles.  For myself, I like the taste so use large pieces, but for those who don't care for the taste, I grind it into a powder using a coffee grinder, and then add it to the dish.  That way the nutrition is there without the taste.  I also like this company's kombu."
1,"I bought this because it was touted to be a salt substitute. Unfortunately, it just tastes like seaweed, which it is."
1,"I love this product. Make homemade sport gels from it and I am not attempt to eat it during the day, because raw taste is very salty. I will buy it again."
1,"On a recent trip to Asia, I fell in love with this coffee.  More like a coffee-flavored sweet beverage, these combine lots of sugar, lots of cream, and some instant coffee into one delivery vehicle.  It's a sweet, warm comfort drink with the need for nothing more than hot water and a container.  Quick, easy, and tasty.  Also, cheap.<br /><br />Note that these are not for American sized 24oz cups.  These are for actual 1-cup cups.  If you use too large of a vessel, it will taste watered down."
1,I was introduced to this during my stay in Dubai a few months ago. This is awesome coffee. I brought some home with me now I'm searching for it online. I crave this coffee. Its the best.
1,"i love this convenient instant coffee premixed with cream sugar - and it actually tastes much better than brewed coffee! Believe it or not, i saw this Nescafe 3-in-1 first sold in the Philippines before it became available on Amazon or anywhere else in the USA. I highly recommend this rich tasting Nescafe 3-in-1 instant coffee over regular brewed coffee! Great to have when you travel!"
1,I enjoyed this coffee because all the elements that I enjoy are included.  It has just the right amount of creamer and sugar.  I am working overseas where it is difficult to get things so this was perfect.  The first time I ordered it came perfectly packaged.  The second time it came in an open box and it appear that extra sticks were placed in the box to make up for the missing ones in the open package.  On top of that the box was open and held together by a string.  A STRING.  It apparently was shipped directly from Thailand.  I will make sure I know where my purchases are coming from in the future.  Over all this is a great product but the shipping is questionable.
1,"After staying in SE Asia for a while, I found these in the supermarket and boy, was I impressed. Even my husband, who typically likes his coffee strong, started swiping my Nescafe coffee packets. They're easy, they dissolve perfectly and are delicious. Just the right sweetness and coffee taste, in my opinion. It makes me wonder what Nestle is thinking not offering these little gems in the States. The price overseas for this 30 pk bag is about $3. I am in sticker shock at the nearly $17 price tag and refuse to pay that much. They're good but I'll stick with the Vinacafe which we've found locally, until the price drops for Nescafe."
1,"I like the product Nescafe 3 in 1 but causes some acidity, other vise it's ok i like it. i advice the people who need<br />Quick cheap and healthy coffee should buy this product. Thanks"
1,"Last year while in Liverpool, England I had the experience to try Nescafe 3 in 1 instant coffee sticks.  I have searched for nearly a year to find them in the US and finally decided to purchase online.  They are delicious for those who like a little extra in their coffee and easy to take with you whenever you need a little coffee break.  I appreciate being able to purchase online....I can close my eyes and return to Liverpool!  Thanks, Heidi O"
1,"I i was born and raised in west Africa half of my life. and i grew up drinking coffee and tea we grew ourselves. so Nescafe brand has been part of my unforgetable childhood, after i came to America i find it extremely hard to drink the coffee here, because its too strong for me and i can get easily addicted to the caffeine, which is bad news for me cause i don't like being dependent on anything that i can control or stop. so i gave up on coffee and stick to my tea and hot chocolate. recently my THai roommate in college gave me a pack of these coffee after coming back home from winter break, i told her that i dont' drink coffee anymore, but then i started to work night shift at the hospital and need to stay awake since im not use to working at night. so one day i drank this coffee praying that i wont get addicted to it, and i swear i almost cried, because it gave me that nostalgic feeling i have been craving and searching for the past 10 yrs. the coffee is not at all too strong, nor too light its just perfect, it has creamer which i love n sugar but i add more sugar because i have a sweet tooth. overall you will NOT be disappointed if you buy this product."
1,"I drink only black coffee, but this was a stocking stuffer for the ladies in my family. All enjoyed, good brew. Thanks, Nescafe."
1,This is the best coffee - well worth the money.  So easy to take to work or on a trip - rich delicious coffee in a minute.  Loved the fast service too!
1,Haven't been able to find this in the USA so Amazon is the answer... This is the BEST instant coffee. Worth a little extra to purchase online.
1,The seller got us our coffee within less than 24 hours.  Very impressive customer service and the coffee was great!
1,"I too first tasted this in Thailand, where we had it in the morning during our multi-day hiking trip.  It was the only thing getting us out of the warm sleeping bag in the morning.<br /><br />Very creamy and sugary - just the way I like it."
1,"i cannot believe that more places dont stock this item, its one great cup of coffee.  i dont even drink coffee, but this stuff got me hooked when i worked in qatar and visited dubai.  now i have to have it for the winter months at least.  fast shipping."
1,"I, like many of the reviewers,fist tasted this in Thailand were coincidently i have meet my wife hahah, she now sends it to me in Afghanistan were I'm currently working,and luxuries are at a premium or non existent. some of my coworkers have tasted it and are asking me to get my wife to send them some"
1,I am SO hooked on this coffee. Best instant on the planet. Perfect for the office where crummy coffee is served and place is loaded with turkeys who leave an empty pot on the burner.
1,"Enjoyed the coffee,i first drank this brand of coffee when i was in Thailand and enjoyed it very much....Thank You"
0,i found this Nescafe 3 in 1 Regular Instant Coffee 30 Sticks (600g) in my local farmes market selling it for $7.99
1,"I ordered this coffee and mmmmmmmmmm i fell in love this Coffee, I drink this coffee in Russia before!!! I did't find in USA this kinda coffee!!!!!!!!!<br />Seller do you wanna be rich????????? What is going on with you??? Where is coffee? When it'll be available again????????????"
1,"Love fig newtons!  These are really fresh individually sealed, unlike their 1lb counterpart packages that have a tendency to get stale rather quickly.  These are worth the extra cost for that reason alone.  But, they're grab and go snacks too that are somewhat healthy for you than a regular cookie.  They also make great treats for after ballgames and other sports.  We love these in our house, highly recommend!"
1,Most people have had these at sometime in their life so no need to tell you how good they are. Only problem is - when getting this quantity it is hard not to eat them continuously!  Too bad the calories can't be quartered :)
1,I love these individual size snacks. These packets are portable and (at least in my case) keep me from eating too many fig newtons.<br /><br />The only thing I would appreciate is if Amazon would give you an idea of when these items will expire. I really hate wasting food but I can't possibly eat a couple of boxes of fig newtons in a month.
1,"I like Fig Newtons and have been missing them since I cut out white flour and enriched flour from my diet. These are made with whole grain and taste very good. The reason I can't give them five stars is because even though the advertisement does not list ""high fructose corn syrup"" as an ingredient, the actual nutrition label does. This is an ingredient that I try not to have in my food, but it is getting very difficult to find products that don't contain it."
1,"I demand you to eat more of this product ... Soon, this item will be mandated by your government to be consumed by all ...  cause it's sooooo damn good!!!"
1,"Arrived fresh.  Handy packaging.  I take them with me on longer bike rides.  Give me as much fuel as a Powerbar or whatever, cost a lot less."
0,I should've listened to other reviewers when they said these things are dry. They are very dry and taste nothing like the fig newtons I'm used to. Too bad they couldn't successfully merge the fig newton with whole grains. It just doesn't work
0,"I love Fig Newtons and so does my 7 year old, so I thought I'd try the minis in a convenient size. Unfortunately they don't taste very good. There is hardly any fig inside and they're a bit dry. I'll opt for the regular size Newtons the next time I buy them."
1,If you are like me you love fig newtons but they are so sweet you get tired of them fast. This way the opened bigger boxes aren't left to get stale.
1,"While not readily available in many markets, the fat free fig newtons are an excellent dessert alternative for those trying to lower chlosterol without drugs. Very tasty and satisfying. The price and free shipping save us about 30% at Amazon compared to the Safeway market. Almost time for another case!"

1,"WHILE WATCHING TV, I LOVE A GOOD SNACK TO HELP PASS THE TIME. A GOOD LOW FAT FIG NEWTON WILL HIT THE SPOT. I'VE ALWAYS LOVED FIG NEWTONS IN THE PAST AND STILL DO NOW. WITH A LW FAT VANILLA MILK, AM IN BUSINESS WITH A REMOTE CONTROL IN MY HANDS."
0,the jam inside feels cheap and don't like the taste. thought the rate on amazon was pretty good but feel disappointed.
1,Fig Newtons are so good that I always keep them on hand. Just right for a quick and delicious snack or for a small dessert after a nice meal.
1,It's a ton of fig newtons so how can you go wrong. If you've never had a Fig Newton then you owe it to yourself to try them. It is its own unique flavor and texture.
1,"I have to stay for long hours at school, and I've been looking for snacks I can bring that aren't too unhealthy. When I found out about these fig newton minis, I was pretty excited since I absolutely love the full size fig newtons. Since they're smaller, there is of course much less of the fruit filling.. but still, a delicious snack. The size of each individual bag is quite small (a little over 1oz) so it's not too great at staving off those hunger pangs, but it helps."
1,This was our regular purchase item from grocery store. Subscribe and Save saved me time and $ . Loved it
1,just enough when you want a little something. i think we've all ate this as kids and it's easy to carry around
1,These are very good bars and being individually wrapped stay fresh a long time. My husband carries them in his car for a quick and easy snack.
1,"These are Fig Newtons, what can you say?  Everyone likes them (or not).  They are a nice-sized snack in a nearly indestructible foil wrapper.  You get two double-length cookies, approximately equivalent to 4 regular Fig Newtons.  Good for tossing in lunches, purses, the car, etc.  Arrived very fresh and in good shape.  Handy as a somewhat more nutritious snack.  We like them enough to order more, when on sale!"
1,love me some Newtons and I can eat these in bunches and never stop. they are so good. i have dug them from way back in the day and they are a must for me everytime.
1,"When you have a family that loves fig newtons as much as mine, it is best to buy them by the case than depend<br />on grocery store sales which don't happen often on these cookies.  They are still the best quality with the most<br />filling and crunch of any fig cookies on the market so they are worth the extra expense over cheap no-name<br />brands."
1,"This was a great deal online. My son loves fig newtons. I bought two boxes a while ago and they're perfect for breakfast, on the run, and for running errands. I throw the pack in my purse, keep some in the car, and in my sons bag."
1,"If this is the first time you've considered tasting a Fig Newton then, Welcome to; America, planet Earth, or back from the dead. Nabisco has been baking these little gems for over 100 years and they are a part of American culture. If you actually haven't tried a ""Newton"" they are small cookies that consist of a soft cake outer sleeve with sweet fig jam in the middle. These packages are half the size of a regular package of newtons and come in a rigid plastic tray, inside a plastic bag, inside a small cardboard box. These were fresh and well within the ""best by"" date."
1,This is a great food for large breeds. It has glucosamine in it that helps with the common problem of hip displasia found in large breed dogs. I would recommend this to anyone with a large breed. When I switched to this food my Mastiff started walking better and now doesn't limp. I will never feed anything but Hill's and the other poster is severly misinformed.
1,"Everything people  researched about what is in science diet is hear say. Then those people look up information about the contents they think they found about the food  and see that certain items are bad. Instead of using Google to ""research"" go to a vet store and physically see what they put in science diet dog food. My vet recommended I put my dog on science diet l/d because of liver issues and yes for the price this food  I had done a little online research and said man this can't be good for a dog. I went to the vet and read for myself what this  food contained and first thing it said was chicken ..so I kept reading and saw all the vitamins and nutirents are added in this food. I'm not going to sit here with a bag of the dog food and start writing down everything listed in this food because I don't have the patients to do so.  I encourage those to get up off the computer and go to a vet store and physically see for yourself what is in this food and quit listening to other people because they sound educated. By the way this food is dog wonders for my dog health."
1,"Science Diet dog food is pretty pricey, but the overall effects of this product is great. I had been feeding my dog Iams Lamb and Rice for years (also a decent dog food) and after my local grocery store stopped carrying it, I decided to try Science Diet to see why my vet recommened it so highly. My dogs love the stuff. A big bowl of Iams would last a couple of days or sometimes three with my animals returning to the bowl to chow down here and there throughout the day, the same sized serving of Science Diet is scarfed down in one sitting with my dogs liking the bowl clean.<br /><br />It has produced better 'dog biscuits' from them as well. Not that they had terrible stool from the Iams, but it is noticeably firmer and they don't use the bathroom nearly as much which lets me know they are digesting more of the material and excreting less waste. After a few weeks of them being on Science Diet I have also noticed their coats getting a healthier shine to them as well.<br /><br />It is pricey stuff, but if my results are typical, I recommend the purchase."
0,"This is a really lousy quality food made primarily of corn and byproducts. Corn is a cheap filler which offers little nutritional value and byproducts, well self explanatory (leftovers when all the nutritious bits have been taken out for human consumption). Dont let your vet talk you into feeding this to your dogs. Vets do not receive any nutritional training besides what is offered to them by sales reps from Hills! Whats ironic is that this ""food"" is no better then any low end grocery store brand, yet you're expected to shell out as much as better quality brands. Check out dog food advisor website for complete product rating and pick a food that is safe and nutritious to feed."
1,"THIS BY FAR THE BEST SALT I HAVE EVER TRIED. I HAVE TRIED MANY SEA SALTS OVER THE YEARS, BUT THIS ONE BEATS ALL THE OTHERS HANDS DOWN. VERY EXPENSIVE, BUT WORTH EVERY PENNY.VELVET IS THE RIGHT WORD FOR THIS SALT BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE VELVET ON YOUR TONGUE IT DISSOLVES WITH SUCH SMOOTHNESS AND NO HARSHNESS AT ALL. THE FLAVOR IS LIKE A MAGICAL OCEAN IN YOUR MOUTH. YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS ONE, YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED."
1,"We have a picky eater who has allergies.  A friend of our clued us in to the fact that dogs with allergies could have problems with grain in dog food.  Researched a little on the internet and turns out there's a lot of merit to that.  We selected Rachel Ray's because it had more meat than most (we just walked Wal-Mart and compared labels till we narrowed it down to two).  Our dog goes hungry before eating food she doesn't like and she gobbles this stuff up.  After 9 months we have noticed her allergies are completely cleared up as well.  Eye buggars and profuse feet licking (the vet said she's allergic to grass - really!)  So after 6 years, apparently we don't need the eye drops and the foot spray.  Just needed to change up her dog food.  Vet didn't mention that either... amazingly the guy who sells us the medicines - go figure!"
1,"I love the idea that proceeds from the sale of this product goes to rescue animals in need. That reason alone was what made me want to buy this product for my dog.<br /><br />My dog still eats his Eukanuba puppy food, but I wanted to buy this too, to give as another form of treat. Since I'm still training him and since I love rewarding him, I like to try anything new I see that seems healthy for him.<br /><br />Maybe when he is an adult I'll ask the vet if I can switch  him to this dog food.<br /><br />He does love the taste and if Rachel Ray feeds this to her Isaboo, it must be good."
1,Our dachshund dog does not like a lot of dry dog foods.<br />She loves NUTRISH. This is a good food that has been fed<br />our dog over 2 years.I'd recommend it to any dog owner.<br />I'm glad Rachel Ray put her name on this fine product.<br />I see other reviews and wonder if they work for another<br />dog food company. Our dog and Rachel can not be wrong ! !<br />  Allen Graves  Talent Oregon.
1,"I have 6 dogs ranging from a small Pom to Beagle to APBT and they all really like this food.  The first time I tried it I put it in their bowels along with some of their old food like your supposed to and they picked out and ate all of this and left the old food there!<br /><br />I am not saying this is the best but its far far from the worst or even close.<br /><br />Take some of the ""non verified purchased"" reviews with a grain of salt as some seem to have no life and go from brand to brand saying the same thing and wanting to push their views on others."
0,"I was hoping that mega-bucks Racael Ray would put out a better dog food then this. Out of the first 10 ingredients, five are terrible and should not be fed to a dog that you love. Chicken Meal,Corn Meal,Soybean Meal,Corn Gluten Meal,Dried Beet Pulp-research these products for yourself, they are the top 5 items that cause allergies and food intolerance in animals among other things-that is 50% of the first ten items.<br />I expected better from Racael Ray! On the plus side however, her ""Just 6"" treats is one of BEST products out there, so I know she has the knowledge to make heathy foods for pets, just not willing to part with her money in her dog food line. My dogs LOVE the Just 6 treats and because they are super good for them I do not mind feeding the treats to them."
0,Purchased this at a local grocery store because we ran out of regular dog food. Our dog refuses to eat this food. Not really sure why. He would rather starve and drink water than consider eating this food.
0,"read the ingredients: Corn Meal, Soybean Meal, Corn Gluten Meal...<br />why? why? why???<br />it's documented: grains cause inflammation, arthritis, diabetes....<br /><br />Research for yourself what your dogs should REALLY be eating.<br />look at the ingredients of Stella and Chewy's products,<br />or PawNaturaw Products.<br /><br />We all love our fur babies, and I know Rachel Ray loves hers...<br />so I was hoping she would have given us a better product.<br /><br />It's not too late, Rachel! Re-formulate now!!"
1,"This is the only olive oil we use now.  It is a wonderfully flavored oil and is great for cooking but really perfect for using as dips or dressings.  I actually don't buy it via amazon because you can get it for $20 less and $0 shipping at vitacost, but it's worth every cent, no matter where you purchase it."
1,The coconut cashew bar is not my favorite but nontheless it is still good.  My 5 year old with celiac disease is a coconut fan which is why I purchased this variety.  He seemed to enjoy it.
1,"This is a pretty decent bar, and quite filling. I would suggest less cashews and more coconut to make it more tasty."
1,I love these bars.  I keep them in my purse just in case I get caught in a situation where I get hungry and need a g.f. snack.  The coconut/cashew blend is awesome.
1,The flavor of the coconut cashew is wonderful. They are a wonderful snack my husband. He likes to keep with him because he has celiac disease and never wants to be without a gluten free snack. Bakery on Main has outdone themselves on this product. Love it!!
1,My daughter is gluten free and we picked these up at an expo to sample.  We have tried all of the flavors and they are so good!  They make you feel like you are not missing out on anything being gluten free.  Highly recommend it!
1,"Can you go wrong with cashews and coconut?  Hands down, these bars are supreme!  They are good for you and have a great texture and taste great!  Even if you don't have to eat gluten free, you should try Truebar from Bakery on Main."
1,"Not only are these bars delicious, soft, chewy, and altogether wonderful, they give me a wonderful nostalgic feeling when I eat them. Somehow, they remind me of being a little boy. Our 2.5 year-old son also loves these and the ingredients are such that we can feel good about giving him some. Highly recommended."
1,"Bakery on Main Coconut Cashew Truebar is truly delicious. I have never tasted a bar as good as this one. This bar is a good source fiber and Omega 3, made with many low-GI ingredients, non-GMO, dairy and casein free, low sodium with no transfats or cholesterol and certified gluten free and Kosher Parve. Only 190 calories. I win. Celiacs win. : ) (Also, usually the really natural bars (especially ones with nuts) cause break-outs on my face. I was just waiting for it to happen with this one and it DIDN'T. Double win!!!)"
1,This bar is exceptional for the fiber and good nuts.  I look for great taste in a gluten free bar.  I also must have it gluten free.  This is one product to try if you haven't tried it before!!
1,"Coconut Cashew hands down best ever! I started buying true bars last November 2011 from  Bakery on Main as a way to find better gluten free products if you know anything about being gluten free you will understand its very difficult to eat foods without being absolute sure they are gluten free. From a dedicated source Truebars are not only the very BEST ever tasting they are melt in your mouth best tasting, this is my favorite coconut cashew, so good I found it hard to not eat the entire sleeve of them, 1000% recommended by me.<br /><br />Celiac since birth."
1,Love the taste and texture of all the Truebars - my favorites are this and the Walnut Cappuccino bars - i can eat and not get tired of these bars all day. Our bike racing team has gone GLUTEN FREE and we are using many of the Bakery on Main products. Would highly recommend these to anyone - athlete or not.
1,This candy is AWESOME... read my review I posted on the 5LB bag page. And while you are at it... buy the 5# bag ... they are way cheaper. This 12 pack ends up being only 3.75 LBS and costs $12.50 and the 5LB bag is only $13.00 as of this review.
1,"First of all I would like to say that HANDS DOWN, Haribo makes the best Gummi Candies. It's true. If you've ever tried another brand, you'd know and once you try Haribo, you'd never go back!<br /><br />These Haribo Gummi Candy Gold-Bears are just Bursting with Flavor! They are soft and chewy. (But not so soft that they are sticky and stick to your teeth)! I've loved these since I was young and now my son loves them too. They come in about six different flavors and each one is yummy! You also get a good mix of colors and flavors. They're a great snack and most people can eat them because they're not a ""chocolate-type candy"" where you'd have to worry about allergies.<br /><br />They arrived at my home fresh and delicious. Everyone that's stopped by has had the temptation to eat some.  But, I do recommend the five pound bag over the pack of twelve.  You get approximately a pound and a half more in the five pound bag for about .50 more!<br /><br />Speaking of the Five Pound Bag, the price is a true VALUE! These cost so much at the market or candy store at the mall per pound! And these are the same exact bears, but you don't have to worry if everyone has touched them or how long they've been out in the open before you came along to scoop them up in your bag! That's a big plus for me!<br /><br />I definitely recommend these gummi bears, they are a sweet and delicious treat and the VALUE is phenomenal! I will definitely be ordering more and different kinds. We all have our favorites!"
1,"i enjoy my sweets, and the haribo gummi gold bears are no exception.  while many gummy bears are much too sweet and taste incredibly artificial, haribo gummi gold bears are the perfect little dessert or snack at any point during the day, as they are light, and they taste more natural than other gummy bears."
0,"as a real german person ( and sorry for my englis, but i try my best ) i have to say these gummy bears taste not like the gummy bears back here in Germany. i come to the US twice a year and the one year i was a bit ""homesick"", so i bought a bag of my fave german gummy bears. what can i say, the taste was like the original but actually not, even the colors aren`t right. my american friend loves the gummy bears from Germany, so i carry every 6months 30bags into the US. if you love the american version, fine, but if you ever have the chance to get a bag from Germany, try the ""original"", much better."
0,"German Haribos don't contain artificial flavors and no artificial colors. German Haribos are all natural.<br />The Turkish ones however taste too sweet and less fruity, and look much more colorful because of artificial colors (FD & C yellow no. 5, red no. 40,blue no.1) and unnatural flavors.<br /><br />When you send a mail to Haribo, they reply that the Turkish Haribos, sold in the US, contain that artificial stuff, so that the Gummy Bear flavor survives the long shipping by ship. Looking at long shelf life duration of even the German Haribos that seems like a lie to me. Cost cutting and less restrictive US-Food regulation seem to be the real reasons ...<br /><br />Hungarian made Haribos (seen in India) aren't any better btw."
1,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVT042"">Haribo's Original Gold-Bears (Pack of 12)</a> is a great way to buy sweets that aren't always easy to find in the US. I wasn't always a Haribo gummi fan, but I have my ex girlfriend to thank for getting me hooked.  These come in sugar free versions as well, but I prefer the regular ones.<br /><br />I really love this 12 pack more than the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVOSE4"">Haribo Gummi Candy Gold-Bears, 5-Pound Bags</a> that are also sold on Amazon.  The main reason is that the 5 lb bag is only ideal for a party with A LOT of kids eating them.  I know that the 5 lb bag gives you more candy for your money.  But these 5 OZ bags keep the gummis fresh and help with portion control.<br /><br />I always share when I eat these or save the excess.  For me a 5-oz bag is too much to eat alone.  1 5-Oz bag is good enough for 3 or 4 people to share.<br /><br />Haribo gummis are very chewy compared to others, but they also contain less sugar and more fruity flavor.  I personally think they are the best.  They have 5 flavors inside including pineapple, lemon, orange raspberry and strawberry.<br /><br />Definitely don't hesitate to get this.  I haven't tried all of the weird flavors (cola, etc) but I have had many and they are almost all great.  But these original bears are going to please most people.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
1,"I have been hooked on these gummi bears for years! I used to work on an Army base and whenever one of our soldiers would go TDY to Germany, we would make him bring these back for us!! I'd tried different types after I left the base, but couldn't find the particular flavor. When I did happen upon it, I was so happy to discover Haribo brand again! Yay, go Gummi Bearen!!"
1,"I am somewhat of a gummi connoisseur of the gummi candy.  I consider the gummi it's own food group.  (If not, what group does it belong in?)  Anyway, after searching and sampling bear after bear across the globe, the Haribo are the best ever.  The flavor and more importantly the consistency of the gummi is perfect.  They are not too soft, so some of the cheap store brands and they are not too hard or solid to where you can't chew them easily.  I ate these overseas years ago and every time I traveled to Europe, I would bring home a stash.  I found that Amazon now carries them, so I am in heaven.  When I bring bags to work to share, they disappear faster than any other candy.  Really a treat.  People laugh when I tell them Haribo is the best gummi bear ever, but once they try them, they all agree with me."
0,"I am German but have lived in the United States for almost 13 years now. It truly pains me to see what Haribo has decided to sell here in the US under the ""Gold-Bears"" brand. Anyone who has ever tasted the real thing will know immediately how fake these are - by simply looking at them!<br />You can tell right away that their German tagline ""No artificial flavors or colors"" does NOT apply here.<br /><br />Imported from Turkey? If you're going to ship all the way from over there, why not give the American consumer something worthwhile...?"
1,"Hans Riegel was not only one of the most prominent manufacturer's of sweets, he introduced a product to the world that's far more addictive than crack or heroine.  These sweet little gummies are some of the tastiest bits of candy on the market.  Unfortunately they're addictive as well...my son foams at the mouth, begging for gummies at all hours.  At times this works to our advantage...bribery, a la the Scooby Snack. However, we know these are not the most nutritious snacks on the market.<br /><br />Curse you Hans Riegel!"
1,"I'm a gummi candy freak.  I've tried everything, gummi worms, gummi o's, gummi bears, all different brands and flavors.  These are the best gummi bears out there!  These are chewy...very chewy...and delicious!  These make a great treat to end the day!<br /><br />Yes, the 5  pd. bag is a better deal but I like how these are individually wrapped.  It keeps them fresh longer and keeps me from eating 5 pds. of gummi bears in one sitting!!<br /><br />Love!!"
1,"This is the best gummy bears that I know of.  No wonder they are the biggest gummy bear manufacturer in the world (based in Germany).  It is not too sticky that it glues your teeth.  Not too sweet neither.  Just the right combination of flavors to taste.<br /><br />Just FYI: 5 oz bag has 3.5 servings, with each serving at 140 calories, 10% carbo, 21g sugar, and 3g of protein.  A serving is about 17 pieces of gummies."
1,"i've had my share of gummy bears in my life (they're my favorite candy,) and these take the cake.  where to begin?<br /><br />the fruit flavors are perfect and well balanced.  no matter what flavor distribution i throw back, from one at a time to a whole handful, it always tastes great.  great flavor balance.<br /><br />consistency-wise they are on the firm side (which is a very good thing, nothin' worse than a soft/squishy gummy).  the beeswax coating is the best way to keep them from sticking together as well, no powdery or filmy residue after you eat them.  just your plain ol' mouth ready to eat more gold bears.<br /><br />they have always been pretty fresh to me, as well. sometimes the 5 lb. HUGE bag can get a bit stale, but this only happens with the last few handfuls and even the stale ones are better than most other gummies.<br /><br />finally, they have what i call a long betrayal period, meaning you can eat a large quantity of them before feeling sick of them.  this could be seen as a vice for their obvious dental and dietary drawbacks, but i'm giving points for their lasting quality.<br /><br />I like getting the 5 lb. bag over this box of 12 bags because it's cheaper by volume and i like the lack of excess plastic packaging involved.  plus as i stated before they don't go stale very quickly.<br /><br />very VERY good."
1,"I have been a fan of HARIBO Gold Bears for many years and these are the highest quality, best tasting, gummys in the world. Definitely recommend getting the 5 lb bag, its more economical. Thank you HARIBO!!"
1,I don't know why my local Safeway discontinued these German candies in place of their own Bear candy- there just isn't any substitute for the original.
1,"I first tried these after a friend brought them back from germany. can't eat just one? I'm lucky if a bag lasts me more than one sitting. forget ice-cream; when it comes to these gummies I lose all willpower. at least they're fat free... :P<br /><br />oh, if you're in the portland area check out wallgreens, they carry them!!"
1,Deeeelicious! Bought two large bags of these from Amazon. The shipment took a while (2 weeks!) but was worth the wait. Haribo is by far my only favorite gummy maker. Yuuuumy!
0,"These gummy bears are indeed original Haribo candy but it is made in and shipped from Turkey (yes, Turkey).  I am not sure how long it takes to get to the US but the candy is unusually hard and stale.  You may want to stick to the ones you buy at a local supermarket.  I have had much better luck (albeit 30 or 40% more expensive) with the same product from a local Walmart.  Your mileage may vary of course."
1,I grew up eating these when I lived in Germany.  They are truly my obsession!  These are the originals;  do not accept any substitutes for Haribo.  They are the only true gummi makers.  Enjoy!
1,I bought five pounds of these things and while they are good check the label. The product we buy here is from Turkey not Germany. I wanted real German Haribo Gummi bears and these are not them.
1,I was going to get my husband the 5lb bag for Christmas but then I saw these.  The individual packs guarantee you are eating a fresh bag every time and you can take them with you easier.  He takes them to work sometimes.  It's a bit more expensive than the 5lb bag but its still a good deal.
1,I tried these gummy bears while at my local drug store and was hooked. The texture and the taste kept me coming back for more..When I would try the generic store brand or other brands on the shelve it was such a step down in taste from Haribo. A matter of fact I'm about to go get some now. I highly recommend these gold-bears. Enjoy!
1,"I bought this item for care packages for my boyfriend currently in Afghanistan -he loves gummy candy.  It was a good price, and nice to have on hand, as I sent him two packages or so every couple of weeks."
1,"These gummy bears have such a great flavor, and they are more chewy than normal, so they last longer. Definitely the perfect movie snack!"
1,it's candy! it's delicious. these are on sale at amazon from time to time. I always buy them when there's a promo code.
1,"I love these gummy bears. They put me into a sugar coma though, so I try to only eat them every once in a while, but you can't beat the fruity flavor and gummy consistency. My favorite flavors are the Red and White. Soo full of flavor and yummy. Great deal on Amazon for these, based on what you pay in stores!"
1,Haribo really does make the best gummy bears and this was a great price and the candy was very fresh not hard like a lot of other brands that are on the market.  The kids love them as a quick snack.
1,Haribo is amazing and the price is excellent as well. The only negative is the difficulty in NOT eating a whole bag at once!
1,I have been ordering gummi bears through here for awhile. I am very pleased the way my order is completed and sent to me in a timely manner.  I would recommend this to anyone.
1,"I agree. This is one of the best gummy bear. However, check your local store, such as Walmart. It is just one buck! The price here is not so cheap."
1,"I absolutely love these candies. I cannot get enough of them and when I read about someone buying a 5lb bag on Amazon I checked it out and bought 12-5 oz bags. I feel it would be easier to carry with you to the movies, or work with smaller packages. The amount of money you save buying in bulk on amazon as opposed to stores in great and was enought o convince me. No other gummi bear compares in flavor and quality. Every other one seems to scratch my throat or taste too acidic and like cough medicine. Haribo on the other hand is gummy gummi bear goodness and like one other review said they are very versatile as they can be eaten by themselves, on top of ice cream, frozen in home-made ice cream, made in cakes, or part of decorative gingerbread houses you can do many things with this simple, great-tasting candy."
1,Haribo makes the best gummi bears. good mix of toughness with gummi goodness. Will order again soon.
1,"I'm addicted to Haribo Gummi bears, not only are they great to eat stand-alone but they're delicious as an ice cream topping too!"
1,"I used to buy these for my daughters when I was stationed overseas and would go on temporary duty assignments to Germany.  Everytime I came home they always knew they would have more gummi bears.  They have been doing nothing but remembering the gummi bears this year so as a christmas treat I decided to buy them some and if it's a big hit, it may be a new christmas tradition for not only them but my grandson too."
1,When I was a small girl my uncle used to send us gummy candy from Germany. I have been eating Haribo candies for as long as I remember... They were such a treat! and still are!!!
1,"These came fresh and flavorful. I was worried that they might be stale, because they're from Amazon, but they were still soft. These are definitely my new favorite gummi-bears."
1,It is a great buy compare to the local retail stores. I just wish Haribo had more orange colors!!
1,"I consider myself a gummi bear expert. These are very flavorable with a great ""chew""."
1,These taste as good as any gummy.<br />I will try other flavors next time.
1,This is my husband's favorite brand.  The 5 lb bag was a better value but I opted for the individual bags because we would surely eat too many in one sitting without the built-in portion control!
1,These are very good. They arrived fast and are being consumed as we speak. I would recommend these to everyone!!
1,The thing I liked about this is they came in small packages and it was delivered very quickly and fresh
1,"The creme de la creme of gummi bears.  You can't find this product in any grocery stores. (*update: I found these at Long's but for a 5 oz bag they were taxing it at 1.40 a bag.) That alone says enough for me.  It's one of those things that you can only find in exclusive places ie CostPlus, Amazon, etc.<br /><br />Their product is created more of starch, not of gelatin like other brands.  This results more of a cleaner bite rather than a chewy one.  I also found that in other brands, the gummi bears tend to be oily where as Haribo coat theirs with beeswax.  The process of Haribos gummi bears take days to complete; the quality is detected once you bite it.<br /><br />Very enjoyable, fresh (especially when you have 12/5oz bags to enjoy)."
1,"Everyone loved them.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVT042"">Haribo Gummi Candy, Original Gold-Bears, 5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>"
0,These bears were not fresh at all.  They actually were melted all together when I got them.  I contacted Amazon and they promptly took care of the problem.  I do not recommend this product but highly recommend Amazon.
0,These are the American version NOT the European version.  Too damn gooey and sweet.  The euro version has a firmer texture with more flavor and less sugar.  These are disgusting in comparison.
0,"I'm totally disapointed by HARIBO and by the american product - produced in Turkey. They called it original and its not, because they use the corn syrup in the Haribo for the Americans. I'm German living in the US and ordered it for my 2 year old daughter. But I'm totally disapointed. They dont use fructose or syrup made out of fruits. The corn syrup goes into the lever of our kids and turns into fet. Its a grazy thing what Haribo does and I throw all the Gummib&auml;rchen into the trash. Its not ORIGINAL Its against kids and its not a sweet in somehow a good way - its a sweet in a very bad american way where people are used for the experiements of food industry and there profit."
1,"This is the best candy ever tested, once you test it you will always want some more."
1,"This is my favourite brand of gummi bears, and the price it cost me for 12 packs of these is such a great value. I would definitely recommend."
1,"From my experience as a gummi bear lover and amateur connoisseur, I have found that Haribo consistently makes the best gummi bears. However, if you purchase a big bag and fail to eat them quickly, they will get hard. That's why this 12-pack of 5-oz bags is perfect for those who want to satiate their gummi bear cravings without overindulging. Subscribe and Save also allows you to replenish your gummi bear stock periodically at a lower price than most grocery stores or discount stores (e.g. Walmart or Target)."
1,"Kudos to Haribo Gold-Bears. I am in heaven munching on this delicious candy.  Never thought I would have so many bags to myself. And I like it that way.  They are really good, soft and chewey.  I know I will reorder soon."
1,I send these every three months to my nieces and nephew.  They love them and the 5-ounce package is a perfect size for the three of them to share.  I had considered a bigger bag but the twelve packages do not dry out like an open package of several pounds.  I love Haribo's repeat order opportunity.
1,"Listen people, I had no idea that Gummy Bears could taste so good.  My friend always eats Haribo Gummy Bears and I asked her what is so special about them, she gave me a few and I have been hooked ever since.  Haribo Gummy Bears are is the best cany out here, better than chocolate better than anything.  I buy the 3 pound bag and I go through it in no time.<br /><br />HARIBO GUMMY BEARS IS THE BEST!!!!!"
1,Good price for these tasty gummi bears.  These are good sized packages.  The product was fresh and tasted really great.
1,"I love gummi bears, and Haribo is the BEST! These are nice and chewy, excellent fruit flavors. Convenient-sized packages and cheaper than in my grocery store. I'll be ordering these again!"
1,These are our favorite snack.  They taste really good and the flavor's are yummy.  The bag sizes are just right for our daily snack quantity.
1,They are a little harder then when bought in a store.  But definitely not rock hard.  Delicious never the less
1,"These are the absolute best gummy bears! Amazon has a great price and 6 day shipping...to Afghanistan! It doesn't get any Better! When you need a gummy bear fix, look no further."
1,"While on an international travel, I purchased a few bags of Haribo Gunni Bear candies at the Heathrow airport. I loved the taste and so when I got back, I decided to buy some more. Since I had not seen this brand in  the US, I searched online and came across this product on Amazon. I ordered a total of 24 packs, and I was pleased to see that it was exactly the same that I was hoping for, at even a better price! Thanks. I will most probably buy again."
1,"My husband absolutely LOVES his Haribo Gummi Bears.  No other brand will do.  These always arrive fresh and quickly from Amazon, and are a far better value per bag then any other store in our area.  I highly recommend this product."
1,"The best gummy bears on the market. And when you get so much for such a great price, it makes them taste even better. Arrived well packed. Fresh."
1,"Recently purchased these using the kindle with special offers grocery coupon. We have been eating them ever since. They are the best tasting gummy bears out there. My son loves them, my wife loves them, and I love them. Highly recommend if you are going to buy candy."
0,"I thought that I'd really enjoy these but they're so overrated!! I usually like gummi bears but these just aren't that good, I could have bought Walmart's brand and been just as happy! I will now be ordering these or buying these again EVER!! I spent too much and they didn't taste that good, too bad I didn't know how awful they were before I bought... Yuck a real waste of money!!:("
1,Great price for this gummy treat! The best gummy bears by far and they come in a generous quantity per bag.
1,"Well, I am really the one who eat these. My husband and my 3-year old love them. My son particularly likes the red ones, so my husband will eat the rest and leave him the red ones."
1,"In search of the original gummi bear from my youth, I struck gold on Amazon. Not only was a wide variety of the product(in terms of quantity and packaging) available, but pricing was quite reasonable. The 5-ounce bags work great as stocking stuffers and ancillary birthday gifts."
1,"This is the first time that I have purchased Haribo Gummi bears and they are chewier and the taste is more subtle than other gummi bears with which I was familiar.  However, they quickly become addictive and that is why a 5 lb bag would spell disaster for me because I would be unable to stop eating them.  I like the fact that the gummi bears are chewier because it slows me down.  Initially I ate several gummi bears at one time and it was hard to distinguish the different flavors.  I currently find the taste to be more distinctive if I eat the same flavor at one time.<br /><br />I will buy Haibo gummy bears again because I like the consistency and taste which I think is more subtle than others that I have tried."
1,They are confection perfection!  Not too soft and just the right amount of flavor.  I love these gummy bears!!
1,"These are gummy bears for the gourmet. They are not the traditional gummy bear taste, they are much more complex. Don't be put off by the tougher texture, I like to open the bag and let them get a little tough before they taste the best!"
1,"I have access to these gummi bears on a daily basis! I love these gummi bears, the lil gummi bears and other Haribo candies!! My fianc&eacute; works for a retired teacher (Joe) who gets these candies and sells them to teacher who uses this candy as a fundraiser. The best candy I have ever tired!!!!!!!!!! Yum Yum!<br /><br />If you know anyone who needs fundraising ideas: we are the European Student Programs, Inc, our number is 1-800-437-2602, ask for Joe..we ship anywhere for free! :) enjoy the Haribo products!!"
1,"THis are the Original Gummy Bears, my brother discovered in Germany and since then (last year 2006) we couldnt find them nowhere. Great product."

0,After eating these gummi bears my husband and I experienced intense stomach discomfort similar to a stomach virus. I wil never order these again.
1,"Great taste, great price. I subscribe and save. Best taste and texture when slighly warmed (70s F) from winter room temperatures. Great stocking stuffer. Amazon must do pretty good volume since they're always very fresh.<br /><br />5# bag is good deal, but not good choice for portion control or freshness."
1,"I recently ordered 2 boxes of Gummi Bears as a gift for a friend for Valentines Day.<br />They arrived and she was surprised and happy. Unfortunately somewhere in Amazon's shipping chain someone cut open one of the boxes and stole one of the packages. An Amazon sticker was places over the intruders opening to attempt to cover up the theft. I reported this to Amazon but I received no response.<br /><br />I had previously only ordered books from Amazon and never had a problem, always received what I ordered in good condition and well packed.<br /><br />What really ticks me off is that they did not respond when I reported the theft.<br /><br />Peter"
0,The shipment came quick enough but the Gummi Bears were all melted together in one big glob.  Wasted a lot of money and the Gummi's were for a party I was throwing.  SO I had to run out to an outlet mall to get them.
0,I searched for 'vegetarian candy' and this was one of the first results - gelatin is made from animal by-products.
0,"I have been eating 3lbs bags of Haribo for years, enjoying this candy exclusively. Tonight I ate a handful from the bag and nearly gagged, this stuff was disgusting!  I looked on the back of the bag and saw MADE IN TURKEY!  Amazon has never cheated me before, but this was shameful.  I will NOT eat Haribo products again, and have already tossed that worthless bag of gunk into the compost.  Shame on Haribo for producing candy in Turkey and sending the filth to the USA!  Shame of Amazon for being part of that scam."
1,"These are the ""gummy bears"" I mentioned in a previous review. I don't know if the American version tastes as good as the European one, but if they do, I'm jealous...NOT. I mean, 12 packs delivered once a month?! You're kidding, right? I can eat three of these in just one evening. (In fact, I just did.) Where do you think my unnatural energy to write customer reviews come from? Health foods??? Seriously.<br /><br />""Haribo"" has the best candy on the block, so if you're local drug store doesn't stash these cute little teddies, I suppose you have to order them from...Amazon.<br /><br />But don't tell me 12 packs are enough."
0,"I did a search for vegan candy and this was near top of list. But the product contains gelatin, which is made from animal bones, pigs and horses' hooves. Very deceiving for Amazon, and potentially a legal suit in the making!"
0,"As one other reviewer already did, I would like to point out that these are NOT vegetarian- they contain gelatin."
0,"I bought this purely on curiosity on why it's so highly rated.  So when I tried it, there isn't anything special about these gummy bears.. don't waste your time or $ if you generally don't care about gummy bears."
1,"I couldn't believe that someone spread such utter porcine ablution about my favorite coffee candy.<br /><br />IT DOES NOT CONTAIN HIGH-FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP. Never did, never will.<br /><br />Ingredients: Cane Sugar, Glucose (tapioca), Milk Powder, Coffee Extract, Natural Coffee Flavor, Coconut Oil, Salt, Caramel.<br /><br />Don't take my word for it, go to naturalhomeandgarden-dot-com; ""The Arabica coffee used in our candy originates solely from the Toraja Province in the northern Indonesian Islands, one of the finest growing regions in that area. Arabica coffee from this region is considered by many as the best in the world, prized for its full body, well balanced acidity, and sweet and woody notes. Rooted with a deep sense of cultural history, the coffee has been grown in this region for over two centuries. It is considered by connoisseurs to be among the finest and rarest in the world.""<br /><br />Bali's Best is simply the finest coffee candy I've ever tasted. It tastes exactly like a cup of fresh-brewed Sumatran coffee, with just enough sweetness to officially qualify as ""candy.""<br /><br />I have no idea what the other bozo reviewing this product was eating, but it certainly wasn't Bali's Best coffee candy. (They don't know the difference between HFCS and tapioca-derived glucose, either.)"
1,"This candy is so good!!!  It has a strong coffee flavor, but is sweet, not bitter.  And it is a great price, too:  less than $18, including shipping and handling, for 300 pieces!  Can't hardly beat that."
0,"I've tried numerous coffee candies and this is by far the worst I've ever had. I should have known, seeing the main ingredient as Glucose syrup. Not only does it break up in your mouth, but the texture of the center goop is nauseating like a blob of snot. It breaks into sharp shards first, then you get the gross inner surprise...bleh!!! If you like high fructose type syrup, then this crap is for you."

0,"We got the order very quickly, which was great.  However, the product is stale.  What should only take 90 seconds to pop takes us twice as long, and still with many unpopped kernels in the bag.  We don't have this issue with other brands, and am surprised this one is of such poor quality, especially since it's more expensive than the other brands.  Save your money!"
0,"The friendly face of Mr. Redenbacher may grace this bag of popcorn, and the bright colors and promising text may promise a healthy snack in every bag, but don't be fooled.  Behind that kind smile and bright colors is the smell of smoke, and blackened dreams.<br /><br />Simply put, this is the worst popcorn I've ever had.  Not for it's taste, but in the fact that every single time I've microwaved it, both the popcorn and the bag itself come out burnt.  No matter how closely I followed the directions, or turned down the power setting, or changed the times, both the bag and the corn came out blackened, filling the kitchen with the pungent odor of burnt popcorn.<br /><br />For those who think the problem may lie with the microwave I used, that wasn't the case, as it is new (only a month old).  While I initially went on a setting of 10 (high), like the bag recommends, I eventually resorted to going as low as 7, which resulted in the bag going flat, and the bottom getting burned.  At that point, my father and I agreed that I had wasted my money.  I've popped bags of popcorn over 5 years old that tasted better and come out with no burn marks whatsoever.<br /><br />Despite the low calorie count per bag, this is one popcorn best left on the shelf."
0,"This isn't the worst quality food you could feed, but it isn't a high quality product, either.  Yet the price is comparable to premium quality holistic foods-- probably a marketing decision related to Rachel Ray's starpower?  I purchased this during an emergency- an ice storm had begun and I was out of dog food, so I grabbed a small bag at a convenient store on the way home from work.  My dogs ate it willingly, although they didn't love it.<br /><br />Nutrish foods (both the chicken and beef options) have lots of indigestible corn, artificial dyes, and gluten.  Corn seems to pass through most dogs nearly undigested, leading to large stools and wasted money.  Gluten was the ingredient implicated in the tainted pet food scandals over the last couple of years-- it just isn't a wholesome ingredient, and it's one I tend to avoid. The good things I can say about this food are that it doesn't use yucky slaughterhouse ""by-products"", and that it includes great vegetable ingredients.  Overall, there are worse options on the grocery store shelves, but this is an overpriced, less-than-great food choice for your best pal.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Ingredients list, so you can make up your own mind:<br />Chicken, Chicken Meal, Brewers Rice, Corn Meal, Soybean Meal, Animal Fat (Preserved with Mixed Tocopherols), Corn Gluten Meal, Brown Rice, Oatmeal, Dried Beet Pulp, Natural Flavor, Dicalcium Phosphate, Salt, Calcium Carbonate, Dehydrated Alfalfa, Dried Peas, Dried Tomatoes, Dried Carrots, Potassium Chloride, Choline Chloride, Olive Oil, Vitamin E Supplement, Zinc Sulfate, Ferrous Sulfate, Iron Oxide, Dried Parsley, L-Ascorbyl-2-Polyphosphate (Source of Vitamin C), Mixed Tocopherols,plus the expected vitamins.<br />``````````````````<br /><br />Here are a couple of alternatives you might want to check out:<br />Nutro Natural Choice Ultra Adult Dog Food- net wt. 35 lbs., Blue Buffalo Chicken & Brown Rice Adult Dog Food, 30 lbs., Wellness Super5Mix Chicken Dry Dog Food (30-lb bag)or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009YWMYE"">Blue Buffalo Lamb & Brown Rice Adult Dog Food, 30 lbs.</a>."
0,"There you think the name Rachael Ray would be associated with a high quality product.... it isn't. Perhaps Rachael doesn't know what a high quality ingredient is.<br /><br />Nutrish is full of fillers and allergens, though it says No Fillers on the packaging. Brown Rice is #8 on the ingredient list, which means there's hardly any brown rice in it. One of the main ingredient is Brewers Rice. Corn and soy are allergens + dogs cannot digest corn.<br /><br />***Brewers rice is the small milled fragments of rice kernels that have been separated from the larger kernels of milled rice. (AAFCO definition).[1] Brewers rice is a processed rice product that is missing many of the nutrients contained in whole ground rice and***<br /><br />I received samples of this food sent to me by the manufacturer. The samples were past the expiration date and the ingredients of the product are not good enough for my dogs. I'm sticking with Innova."
0,"Rachel Ray either knows NOTHING about dog nutrition or she doesn't care.  Rachel, you are no Martha Stewart.<br /><br />Nutrish is anything but, it's loaded with COMMON dog food allergens (soy & corn), fillers (corn gluten & dried beet pulp) and<br />'animal fat'... which is a nice way of saying: We took all the dead & diseased animals from the slaughterhouse leftovers, plus the euthanized dogs & cats, rendered them down, drained off the fat & sold it back to the makers of Nutrish as 'animal fat'.<br /><br />There was a big investigation by the Dept. of Agriculture about 15 years ago, that discovered that many dog foods that<br />contained ANIMAL FAT had high amounts of barbiturates in them, because the fat contained the rendered remains of<br />euthanized pets, which are euthanized by a barbiturate overdose.  DVMs across the US were finding that it was taking<br />more of the barbiturate to euthanize the pet because the pet was being fed a small dose in its food on a daily basis,<br />due to the rendered animal fat found in about 25 dog foods, including Nutro.<br /><br />Dried Beet Pulp is the by-product that is left over from the processing of sugar beets, they extract the sugar, and what's left<br />is beet pulp (usually fed to pigs as it's cheap), but in dogs (which are carnivores) it's INDIGESTIBLE & produces gas (which<br />can cause gastric torsion - fatal if not caught & repaired via a DVM surgery in time) and beet pulp produces a FALSELY firm<br />stool, causing you to believe that your beloved dog is healthy because he's pooping some firm poops.<br /><br />No, the dog can't digest the beet pulp, it dehydrates the dog & passes through like a bale of hay....<br /><br />A good dog food contains WHOLE ingredients (not meal), no fillers, no soy, corn or wheat, whole fruits & veggies, no<br />salt and should contain whole turkey or chicken, whole herring and cottage cheese.  Your dog does not need salt if<br />the food contains whole veggies, potatoes, whole fish or cottage cheese, as those foods naturally contain salt.<br /><br />Natura Pet makes Evo (grain free), Innova, California Natural, and their pet food (cat, dog, ferret) contain 100%<br />HUMAN GRADE ingredients... ""natural"" means nothing.  Natura sells to mom & pop pet food stores, not chains or<br />supermarkets, because their food is preservative free, very tasty & HIGHLY caloric, so feed 1/2 the amount that<br />you would normally feed.  On Evo & on Innova your dog will poop 75--50% less stool volume because there's no<br />fillers and it's digestible.  These foods produce a glorious coat & even the pickiest eater will eat them.  Don't<br />supplement with canned food or other items, you won't need them.<br /><br />My Borzoi would spit out filet mignon scraps if they were cold, not sauteed in butter.  LOL!  But, she LOVED Evo."
0,"I was hoping that mega-bucks Racael Ray would put out a better dog food then this. Out of the first 10 ingredients, five are terrible and should not be fed to a dog that you love. Chicken Meal,Corn Meal,Soybean Meal,Corn Gluten Meal,Dried Beet Pulp-research these products for yourself, they are the top 5 items that cause allergies and food intolerance in animals among other things-that is 50% of the first ten items.<br />I expected better from Racael Ray! On the plus side however, her ""Just 6"" treats is one of BEST products out there, so I know she has the knowledge to make heathy foods for pets, just not willing to part with her money in her dog food line. My dogs LOVE the Just 6 treats and because they are super good for them I do not mind feeding them the treats,but not the food."
0,"Not only does my dog not like this, but it also gives her diarrhea.  Avoid giving your dog this food if at all possible!  There are too many bad allergens in it.  Such a shame Rachael Ray put her name on this awful product."
1,"My dogs love Rachel Ray's Nutrish dog food.  I had tried Purina One, Beneful, and Dog Whisperer Organic dog food, and my dogs ate them reluctantly late at night as a last resort.  But they enjoy their Nutrish.  I really like that ingredient safety is the #1 goal.  Give it a try.  You can find it at Walmart too."
1,"Torcik Wedlowski is a wondeful treat. First found it in Poland but until now I was unable to find on the net. Love the taste and recommend it for a something out of the ordinary. Rich, not too sweet and great looking.  The shipping and handling is high for a small purchase, but probably worth it since going to Poland costs a lot more."
1,This product is outstanding. It's a taste treat for the mouth. I'm a chocolate lover and this fits the bill exactly.
1,"I discovered Wedel chocolates on a trip to Poland and can't get enough.  The chocolate is perfect - rich and smooth but not too sweet.  This torcik is a superb with a cup of tea, some strawberries on top, or even ice cream.  Delicious."
1,"Apart from a hunk of quality dark chocolate, this could be the best dark chocolate treat I've ever had. Unfortunately, it's made with one of the worst oils you can ingest, but so are many. Not too sweet, leaves you wanting more.  Seriously good, and I've had plenty to compare."
1,"A Polish friend took it to me to Italy, where I live, and it made me HAPPY.<br />I would suggest to keep it some minutes in the fridge in summer time.<br />If I cannot buy it at any other place, I'll buy it from Amazon US ! But 10000Km are not too much for such a delice."
1,I fell in love with Stash chocolate mint tea two years ago.  I am thrilled to be able to buy it now in an economical and environmentally friendly way.  This is used for my private use and I've felt uncomfortable with all the many boxes I've gone through in order to have my six bag a day tea fix.  If you are a tea junkie and care about our landfill situation then go for broke and purchase this way and save yourself a couple of hundred bucks.
1,"I have tried many OOlong teas and this is by far the best.  It has a wonderfully light coconut, mango flavor.  The two flavors blend well together, neither one overpowering the other.  I will definitely buy again."
1,"really nice tea, and smells wonderful. I enjoy it with a teaspoon of ""sugar in the raw.""  Stores well as is wrapped in foil. I usually buy the box of 100 teabags since it is an excellent value"
1,"Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile. I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you really, truly like chamomile tea, or own a restaurant, this ginormous box of 1,000 single-serving tea bags is a good choice."
0,Fast shipping. Smells good when you open the tea bag - tastes like watered down coffee with a faint mint aftertaste. Not recommended.
1,"Met the owners of the company today at the NW Chocolate Festival and was able to sample all their current flavors of brittle.  I really liked the blend of flavors in the Bombay Bliss brittle.  The ingredients sounded like an odd combination, but it was not at all.  Very tasty!"
1,"I can now make all the Tiramisu I want plus all the low carb variations that are out there.  Specialty items like this are hard to find in country stores where I live so I keep them in the freezer and escape to Italy anytime I want.

1,"I consider the Alessi Savoiadi lady fingers to be a good value with great taste, very low fat, and a long (9 mo.) shelf life. I liked the last batch better as they were more crisp."
0,"I bought a case of these to make some desserts.  I had no idea I would get so many in each 7 oz. package, or that they would be so big, or that they would be so crunchy.  Taste is fine.  Just know that if you're making a dessert and you expect the ladyfingers to suck up the sauce or sherry or liqueur, buy more sauce/sherry/liqueur than you planned!"
0,"This item was very important for my small baking business and not only did I never receive this item, I had to call them for a refund. The response I got from them regarding the no-show? ""Oh, did you want to re-order it?"" Uh, NO! I had to tell them they needed to return my money asap, which they did do (the very least). I will never do business with this company again and if their ratings are to believed, I'm not the only one very unhappy with them lately. I gave them a single star only because they did return my money."

1,"There has never been a more clever design for candy than the m and m.  The hard candy shell allows it to survive in harsh climates that would ruin chocolate exposed to the temperature highs and lows.  If you can eat just a few, then this should be a part of your home like that container of pretzels.  If, on the other hand, you like to take a container and camp out in front of the tv or computer with them, then the calories start climbing..."
1,"I got this from my local bike shop and I was blown away. It's full flavored and really gets me up in the morning. An added bonus was that my girlfriend doesn't mind the smell of this one brewing, though most others bother her. I will definitely be buying Jittery Joes again, though I will probably order directly from their website as they have a much larger selection."

1,"I NEVER WRITE REVIEWS. But this one you gotta read. Besides tasting great, this product lasts forever! I just finished up a container that had been sitting on my shelf (with a plastic lid)for 22 years and it was still good...a litte, LITTLE mind you, off color.  Then I opened a new one, also 22 years old.  It was obviously still the same as it had been 22 years ago.  This good tasting milk substitute lasts FOREVER."

1,"I'm a wings freak, I rarely get wings anymore at restaurants because they just are not good enough, fast food wings,,,,FORGET IT! If you want the best wings you have ever had, in my very critical opinion, follow this: Put 10 paper towel dried wings, skin on, in a gallon plastic bag with seasoned pancake mix and shake, tap off excess and place on pan. Heat fresh peanut oil, use enough oil so all the wings will be submerged in a deep fryer or Wok, get it very hot but not smoking. Drop in wings, turning as needed. I like them extra crispy, so I wait until they stop bubbling, indicating that all the water is out of them and the chicken fat has melted into the oil, remove and drain on paper towels. I use a large stainless bowl and add Crystal Wing sauce, a tablespoon of salted butter, and an once or two of white vinegar, heat just a bit on burner and add wings and flip a few times until coated. Serve with carrots and celery with a buttermilk ranch dip. Tried the same recipe with other sauces, but its a waste of time and chicken, this sauce is King."
1,I ordered my sportea and it arrived within 10 days.  I brew a fresh pint daily and drink it on the rocks with a slice of lemon or orange and a little bit of sugar. It is caffeine free but still is a picker upper in the afternoon.  Refreshing and delicious! I would highly recommend it over any tea I have ever tasted.
0,"Advertised was a 15 pack of gum, 6 of spearmint, 6 of peppermint, and 3 of another kind of mint. I expected fifteen packs of gum, and bought this because of the quantity relative to the price. I am absolutely appalled that though the gum was in its original FIFTEEN pack box, only thirteen packs were present. One of each non-spearmint flavor was missing. It is rude and unprofessional for packagers to ""take a couple for themself"" and hope that no one is the wiser. If you are going to sell me thirteen packages of gum, do not advertise it as fifteen! To intentionally do this to customers is practically theft. Good day."
1,"I just recently started making shaved ice, and ordered several flavors with my machine. So far it is the best syrup I've had. The flavor is nice and sweet, and it filters into the ice really well. I would definitely recommend this to people that enjoy a sweet, bubblegum type flavor."
0,"What a disgusting flavor, I have never tasted anything worse. it was so bad i poured in into the toilet."
1,"If my dog could review this product, she'd give it 5 stars. She obviously loves the bacon flavor and being a very licky puppy, this is a real treat for her. As the pet owner, I like that she seems so content with the product, but it's a non-traditional way of delivering a treat and seems a bit awkward. The treat is given through a roll-on ball, like the old deodorants. With little treat bites, you can reward a dog with one or two nibbles, but regulating the number of licks or the time they're allowed to lick doesn't work so well. For training purposes, I wouldn't recommend this product, but just for gratuitous treat giving, I think it's just fine."
0,"I tried this product on my dogs 3 times and each time, they would not touch it!  Admittedly, my dogs are picky, but no even one of them would try it.  They would walk up and sniff it, but they would not even taste it.  My dogs (3) are all small dogs and don't eat a lot of food.  Maybe if your dog is larger or less picky, it would appeal, but I can't say I would recommend this product."
1,"Our six dogs (four of our own, plus two foster dogs) all LOVE getting their ""licks"" from this Bacon Flavor Lickety Stik!!!  They are all medium to big dogs (Boxer mixes, Pit Bull mix, Black Lab mix , Plott Hound & Greyhound mix) and they all come a-runnin' when I pull the bottle out.  Even Mollie, our finicky-eater Black Lab mix, loves it.  Sometimes, they try to take a bite, but they all quickly figure out that the trick is to lick the little roll-on-deodorant-type ball.  The key, of course, is to hold the bottle while the dogs help themselves, as opposed to giving them the bottle to do with what they please...  ;o)<br /><br />The bottom line is the Bacon Flavored Lickety Stik gets a unanimous ""Four Paws Up"" from my test panel!  Highly recommended!"
1,"I have to say this is an unusual product.  It's made on the same order as a deodorant and the dog licks the roller to get the flavoring.  We got the liver flavor and all the dogs loved it.  In fact, there was some times when two dogs were trying to lick the roller at the same time since they can't seem to wait their turn.  It's definitely something to try...don't know how well it would do training your dog instead of the regular treats, though.  It'll probably get gross after a few lickings too but a damp paper towel should fix it up...especially if you wipe it after the dog uses it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't comment if it really tastes like liver flavor.  The dog's aren't talking but they definitely seem to like it...<br /><br />Oh yeah, and its made in the USA!"
1,"Well, the title says it all.  The little dogs of the household loved this interesting twist on the traditional treat.  They did not seem to understand why they were not allowed to walk off with it, but they grasped the concept eventually.  Often traveling with our two smallest poms, this ""roll-on"" style treat is a simple, non messy, non-poop-inducing alternative to traditional treats.  It is ""just enough"" when you want to reward them without having to worry about making a mess in the car.  I am not sure if this concept will catch on with the mainstream, but as long as it is competitively priced, I can see this being a useful tool for many dog-rearing activities.  While we are far past that stage, I can see this being helpful for different training activities as well.  Bring yourself and your dog ""outside of the bubble"" and give this new treat a try."
1,"Can you imagine how this product came to fruition?  It seems like an accident.  Like the guys in R&D accidentally filled some roll-on deodorant tubes with dog food flavoring.  Or maybe it was a large-scale Big Lots-style buy where the guys at the pet food factory got an incredibly great deal when a Ban roll-on factory got flooded and had to unload a warehouse.<br /><br />In any event, what seems like a really weird idea is...well, a really weird idea that our dog LOVES.  Of course there's not much nutritional value to letting your dog take a few slurps off the end of a liver-flavored roll-on doggie treat, but hey, there's not much nutritional value to that rawhide toy you just bought him either.  Give this a try for dessert."
1,When I first saw this I wasn't to sure but I love to give my pups new things to try. When it came in I checked it out....it looks like a roll on deodorant. I had to laugh but then came the taste test. I think my dogs are in love with this! We have small dogs...all less than 6lbs and I have to roll the ball for them to get more flavor so it's not so bad but I imagine that larger dogs can roll the ball themselves. If you're looking for something new and different then you may want to give this one a try!
1,"Nina, Sam(antha) and Grizzly are ""licking it up.""  The feature that appeals to me most is that the calorie count is so low per ""taste.""  It's a real snack alternative that many of us with pets should consider!<br /><br />Great idea!<br /><br />I rate ""PetSafe Lickety Stik 1.6-Fluid Ounce, Bacon Flavor""...Five stars!<br /><br />P.S., As many pet snacks are notoriously high in fat, I truly recommend this as a low-calorie alternative!<br /><br />P.P.S., Maybe they should come up with on for us humans?  Just a thought!"
1,"I ordered this, not sure if my dogs would like the roller ball or turn their noses up at it, but I'm happy to report they loved it! They went at it with gusto-so much so that I had to put it away after only a few licks-afraid they might make themselves sick. Little did I know that my little monsters would find a way to knock it off the shelf & absolutely destroy the bottle while I was at the grocery store. I came home to a shredded bottle & 2 pomeranians with very guilty looks on their faces.....<br />I think this is a great product & if the reaction of my dogs is any indication-so do they. I will definitely be ordering more when it becomes available, but might have to invest in a lock box to keep it in....lol!"
1,"I have the most picky dog in the world.  She's a big dog, which usually means they'll eat anything, but not my dog, so when I got her the Likety Stik, I honestly didn't think she'd like it, but she loved it!  And what a great training tool.  Rather than fill your pocket with treats,(that usually go through the wash) you have a neat, no fuss way to reward them.<br /><br />I did have to squeeze it to get the liquid moving along after she'd licked it, and it dripped onto her pure white, newly bathed ruff, but it came off with just water, so no worries.<br /><br />I then took the Stik over to my in-laws to give to their obese King Charles spaniel, and he of course loved it, because he eats anything.  What they liked was being able to give him treats that didn't add to his weight problem.<br /><br />Lickety Stik is a great new way of treating your dog.  Whoever came up with it is a genius.  I'm going to buy every flavor for my dog, and one for my in-laws dog."

0,"The roller ball on this treat (basically gravy) does not roll around readily from the friction of my dog's tongue licking. The only way to get gravy out of the bottle to where the dog can get it is by squeezing the bottle to force the gravy out around the edges and letting the dog lick the gravy off the surface (kind of defeats the purpose of bothering with the roller ball). I let my dog lick this treat for two sessions, but when I went back the third, the roller jammed so no matter how hard I squeezed, none of the gravy inside was coming out. I stood the bottle upright and pushed down on the ball to try to loosen it from the bottle top edge and let more flow through. This seemed to get the flow going again for 2-3 rough squeezes, but it shortly jammed again. I can still move the roller ball around with my fingers, and there will be a little gravy stuck to the part of the ball I move into the open, but it's not working as it was the first two times. There is still 2-3 tablespoons of product left in the bottle. Sorry, but I'm not going to sit there and manually roll the ball around with my fingers or forever tinker with pushing down on the ball so my dog can lick a miniscule amount of gravy at a time. I've checked for anything blocking the area between the bottle end and roller ball, but haven't seen anything likely to stop the flow or rolling (no dried clumps, etc). The convenience is lost if the gravy doesn't come out by itself from squeezing the bottle and the roller ball can't roll with the dog's tongue alone.<br /><br />I would recommend not using this over any carpet or floor surfaces you don't want to risk getting stained since there will likely be dripping. The gravy (when it did come out from squeezing the bottle) comes out from all sides of the ball at once instead of from one point where the dog can focus, so depending on which side your dog likes to lick, it might not catch the gravy from the side that isn't being licked right away in time to catch the gravy before it falls to the floor.<br /><br />The taste seems to be rated middle to low by my dog. My dog loves bacon flavored treats (can't get enough Beggin' Strips) and ate this product up readily enough in the beginning when it was new, but it's since become clear he isn't crazy about it. Now he's seen what this gravy is about, he might take one or two licks then walk away. I have to keep calling him back to encourage him to finish up and take another lick. I don't think I would be able to get him to finish the bottle even if it were flowing properly.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would bother buying more of these unless I was assured of the reliability of the bottle not jamming again and the roller working properly. I would love to see some sort of refillable roller bottle offered so I could fill it with some cheap homemade gravy instead (there is no way to refill these bottles yourself) since I do like the concept of limiting how much gravy he's able to get at at a time via this roller mechanism."
1,"My little diabetic shih-tzu, Lily, is notorious for hating anything new. I am constantly on the search for healthy new treats that I can give her after she has her insulin shot (every 12 hours...ugh!) I received the Liver flavor Lickety Stik and was prepared to donate it to the local animal shelter because I was just sure Lily would turn up her nose to it. Lo and behold...she liked it! It took a minute or two for her to figure out how to get the treat out and I squeezed the bottle too hard and some dripped on the floor, but Lily quickly lapped it up. I don't think the ball turned very easily, but she was determined to try to get the treat-juice out of the bottle. I think this is a great idea, but I am only giving it 4 stars because the packaging was hard to read and the ball didn't seem to turn very readily."
0,"The smell and taste of the Lickety Stik was an instant success with our dog.<br />But the dispensing ball dosen't move easily, very much of the time,<br />and it's a nuisance for us to keep helping the ball turn for our dog to get this treat.<br />We get more on our hands then our Golden gets in his mouth.<br />When we try to turn the ball for our dog, even we find it difficult.<br /><br />The roller BALL is a concern, we don't consider it 'pet safe'.<br />If our Golden Retriver got this bottle,<br />he could easily bite this roller ball out and would try to eat it.<br /><br />The ball requires a strong tounge to move it, even at that it gets stuck.<br />We can't imagine this stik being at all compatible with small dogs.<br />If you squeeze the bottle to force the liquid out around the ball<br />most of that drops to the ground between licks.<br /><br />This would be a great idea if it worked, and was truely 'pet safe'."
1,"I have one dog, Rex, a Shepherd/Lab mix and he absolutely loves the Lickety Stik. Now if he sees me get it out, he automatically sits or gives me his paw. So cute.<br /><br />This is a great new idea for doggy treats. Especially when walking my dog- I've gotten tired of carrying a bag of treats for him. And new ideas are always welcome, I don't want to overfeed my dog with other treats... They can get expensive because he's allergic to almost everything.<br /><br />So the lickety sticks come in three flavors- liver, chicken and bacon. Rex loved each one. The container that holds the liquid treat is a roller... I saw another reviewer describe it like a deodorant stick with a roller. That is exactly what the case is like. Unfortunately the liquid doesn't just come out when the ball is licked, the bottle has to be squeezed for your dog. My roller gets stuck if I don't squeeze or push it with my finger.<br /><br />I highly suggest trying this item out, great alternative to milk bones :)"
1,"Really like the idea of a roller-ball to give treats, especially as rewards when training (skateboard, leash walking and close commands).  The dispenser is similar to a roll-on deodorant design.  Lickety Stik is a healthy all natural (according to the ads) liquid containing vitamins and low in calories in several flavors. The dispenser contains over 500 licks.  A no mess way to give rewards plus it carries the made in the USA with all-natural ingredients.  My English Bulldog puppy loves the stuff (liver flavor); however, it also comes in chicken and bacon flavors. Following  is a list for those who read the ingredients,  1)natural liver flavors, (2) cultured milk, (3) lecithin, (4) mixed tocopherols (natural preservative- a source of vitamin E), (5) scorbyl palmitate (source of vitamin C), (6) rosemary extract, (7) green tea extract.  A caution about dogs allergic to chicken - they should not be licking this stuff. Unlike most treats, the shelf life is 18 months and ""best"" licked by date is stamped on the bottom of the roll-on dispenser. The description indicates the Lickety Stik formula contains antimicrobial agents - basically no germ transfer. The stuff does not have to be refrigerated.  Naturally, you must shake the dispenser often.  Will be ordering the Lickety Stik 3 pack with all flavors from Amazon.  ""Reilly"" recommends the treat!"
1,"I had to give the ball a partial turn to get some of the liquid on it after shaking to mix it up, but after I did that my dog licked away and loved it! This is a good low-cal treat for dogs and would be great as a training aid. Our dog dutifully performed her repertoire of tricks to get more of the treat, and then followed me back to the kitchen as I put it away. The only bad thing is that you DO have to hold it for the dog, but if you're using it as a training aid that may actually be an advantage.<br /><br />There are over 500 licks in each tube and 10 licks is only 1 calorie. I gave my dog 10 licks per trick.<br /><br />FWIW, my dog is a 1.5 year old hound dog/bird dog mutt."
0,"The Lickety Stick is truly a unique product. It's basically a rollerball bottle (like some deodorants) with different flavored syrups (like chicken, beef, or bacon). I've never seen anything like it. The promo video says dogs love the taste and it's very low cal (oddly, the video also warns of an epidemic of pet obesity, which while probably is true, I had never heard it described in such catastrophic and somber tones). The treat is on the high price end of what dog treats usaully cost, but the maker boasts each bottle contains over 500 licks. I've been trying to figure out if that's a good deal. Normal-sized treat bags don't usually have 500 treats, but on the other hand, you would never just give your dog 1 lick off this thing.<br /><br />If your dog likes the Lickety Stick (there are review testimonies here going both ways), then it's left up to you how long puppy gets to lick, so the touted cost-effectiveness could quickly evaporate (there is no recommended serving size on the bottle). All in all, the Lickety Stick reminds me of a sugar free lollipop. They can have a decent flavor, but not everyone will like them; they don't have calories, so they're ""healthier;"" and because they're calorie free, they don't fill you up at all, which leaves me with a final thought.<br /><br />Regular dog treats do at least have a substance factor; they are a solid food. The Lickety Stick is a calorie free liquid, so the filling factor is missing. And so while Charlie did enjoy the Lickety Stick, she probably won't be getting another one. She is already in great physical condition, eats an organic dog food regimented according to the bag-recommended diet, and is taking C9 vitamin supplements. Basically, she gets enough health stuff is what I'm saying; so when she does get a treat, I want her to enjoy it like the treat that it is. I'm not convinced the Lickety Stick does that. Now, if you are trying to wean your pet off table food or lower their weight, this product could probably help you do that."
1,"Well, it must taste good, 'cause my dog just loves it.  It did take a minute to teach him to lick it instead of just trying to grap it out of my hand."
1,"PetSafe Lickety Stik is a weird looking dispenser full of a delicious liquid treat my pooches are crazy about.  The strange design is slightly bigger than a deoderant bottle and the dogs get their treat by licking the roll-on ball!<br /><br />I own Wonderland Kennels, with 7 Boston Terriers and German Shepherds that I train and compete with.  Even the picky ones love this stuff.  The bottle is small, but it goes a loooong way because the pups are only getting a little at a time, instead of a larger treat.<br /><br />Pacino and Molly (German Shepherds) first instincts were to try to bite down on the dispenser, but it didn't crack and is still holding up fine.  They quickly learned to just lick it, though the best way to introduce it to larger dogs is to hold it completely upside-down so the angle makes it easier to lick and harder for them to grab.<br /><br />I'm honestly surprised by how big a hit this little Lickety Stik is with my pups, and how long the bottle lasts.  Maizy, Molly, Gracie, Pixi, Einstein, Pacino, and Isabelle each give it four paws up!  :)"
1,"When I received this ""Lickety Stik"", I really wasn't sure what to expect with my dog.  Turns out I had nothing to worry about - he is CRAZY about it.  If I even go near the bottle he starts wagging his tail and giving me the excited look.  One aspect about this doohickey I really like is that you can use it as a reward for your pet, without constantly having to give him a biscuit or similar treat; just a lick off the Lickety Stik will do the trick!  The occasional biscuit and treat is okay, but this is much better for active training.  Highly recommend, though you may want to shy away from trying it yourself."
1,"My two Min Pins, who are constantly begging for treats, and then turning their noses up as most of what is offered to them, absolutely love this product.  They actually sat in front of me and took turns licking from the container.  It was hysterical; like two hamsters drinking water.  I will but this product again!"
1,"I wasn't sure if my dogs would be able figure out what to do with this, but they got it right away.  They loved the taste and would have kept licking it as long as I let them. The container is 5"" tall and approx. 1 1/2"" around and easily fit right in my jeans pocket, so this would be very easy to take on a walk. I could also see that this might be helpful if you happen to have a dog who won't eat - you could roll the liquid around the edge of his bowl and it may entice him to eat."
1,As soon as I got this in the mail I opened up this product.  My dogs absolutely loved it. In fact they tried after licking it to pull it out of my hand. This will be very convenient for my agility lessons and shows with my dogs.  Great product!!!
1,"with the exception of my senior chihuahua that viewed the container of Lickety Stik as possibly a lethal weapon and, not wishing to take any chances, tore out of the room when she saw it for under-the-bed protection.<br /><br />""Oh well,"" I said, ""I've got three other dogs.  Let's try them.""  At first my toy bichon-poodle was also wary and stepped back.  But when she saw my shepherd and chow chow growing very excited and thrilled by this new offering, she relented and tasted some herself.  It was a decided hit.<br /><br />There are no directions on the small plastic container as to how to use, so I was uncertain if I should squeeze it and, if so, how tightly.  I quickly learned that squeezing it too firmly causes the liquid to pour out so, if squeezed, ""lightly"" should be the watchword.  I would advise the first time trying it to place a paper towel under the container until one gets the hang of manipulating the small plastic bottle and administering the treat to the dog(s), which will not be a problem as my two large dogs, and eventually the smaller one, just kept wanting to lick and lick and keep on licking.  They found this new-found gadget to be very exciting.<br /><br />What is most appealing about it to me is that it contains all natural ingredients - nothing artificial.  They consist of natural flavors, cultured milk, lecithin, rosemary extract and green tea extract.  It also contains Vitamin A.<br /><br />So this is a fun way to make your dog(s) happy, small enough to carry in your pocket, light enough for easy carrying.  Now I've only used it once, but I predict that the next time my dogs (chihuahua excepted) see me holding the by now familiar container, there'll be a stampede of sorts.  Just like in television commercials.<br /><br />Tail waggin' good!"
0,"Do you know those Tootsie Pop commercials where they'd see how many times the Tootsie Pop could be licked before they'd chew right into it?  That's how this Likety Stik worked with my dog.  He licked it three or four times, then immediately wanted to chew on the roller.  I repeatedly pulled it out each time he'd try, but it kept repeating.  Lick, lick, lick, chew.  Lick, lick, lick chew.  Within one minute, no exaggerating, he had chewed off the end and I was scared to death that he'd swallow the roll ball. Fortunately he spit it out, but if he had swallowed it, he easily could have choked to death on it with it blocking his windpipe.  I would never buy this product again, and highly recommend others not to.  Seriously, it was completely chewed through in one minute of opening the package."
0,My dog just didn't like the taste of them which surprised me since he likes food.  Tried each flavor same result.  I cannot recommend.
1,"This is a nice idea for a low calorie dog treat.<br /><br />It looks just like a roll-on antiperspirant, and you have to roll the ball to get it going. One problem is that this is a syrup or other liquid that is pretty sticky and I usually have to get the ball rolling myself each time. Also, once I offer it to my dogs they can get one lick but cannot get the ball moving.<br /><br />The other problem I've had is my dogs want to take the whole thing, not just lick the surface of it. They seem to like the taste because they really grab the whole thing.<br /><br />I think it's a fun idea and it does seem to taste great to them, though I wouldn't really recommend it because of the ball being hard for dogs to roll. (in my experience)"
0,"I have a 60lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix who loves all sorts of treats so I'm always on the lookout for new products. Unfortunately, many doggie treats have gotten a bit pricey these days if you plan on giving them a helping. When the PetSafe Lickety Stik (essentially the same design as a roll-on deodorant) popped up on Amazon Vine I naturally snatched one up right away. Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Low in calories, 1 per 10 licks.<br /><br />+ My dog loved them.<br /><br />+ Container has a re-sealable cap.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Fluid can drip out of roller ball and leave a sticky residue on surfaces.<br /><br />- Container is not really pet safe if the dog gets ahold of the treat.  Most dogs could easily chew apart the package and choke on the roller ball.<br /><br />- Doesn't promote healthy chewing, essential for a dog's teeth.<br /><br />- Small container is not good for bigger or messier dogs.  My dog licked not just the roller ball but the handle itself including my fingers.<br /><br />- Smells absolutely awful.<br /><br />My dog loved the Lickety Stik (although he's not terribly picky about treats) and the product allowed me to stop his treat giving at any time. Sadly, he doesn't get any dental benefit from ingesting this treat. Better suited for smaller dogs who won't slobber all over trying to lick out the fluid.  Still, I wouldn't pay the asking price for the item. The best thing about this treat was they occupied my dog long enough to groom him sufficiently."
1,"My family has two chihuahuas. I tried the dog treat on the two of them today and got different reactions. The largest chihuahua liked it and the smallest chihuahua did not. This is par to the course and people like different things too.<br /><br />The treat is a liquid that taste like liver. It can be rolled easily anywhere you desire. All you have to do is take the top off and squeeze the sides of container. It is easy to use. It certianly is a new concept as I have always thought of dog treats as something solid.<br /><br />I would recommend it for any dog owner. If you have any questions, ask at this email!"
0,"This is a pretty neat concept, rewarding your dog with licks rather than treats, to cut down calorie consumption.  However, it's only good if your dog likes it.  Mine doesn't.  To be fair, he's 8 years old and set in his ways."
0,"This item seems like a great idea...a convenient, and non-messy way to carry treats for the dog.  It is like a roll-on deodorant container...a bottle of fluid with a rolling ball top that brings the fluid up to the top of the ball as it is spun.  It has a rich, bacon smell smell to it and my little dog (7 lb. Maltese) was interested in it, but I couldn't get him to lick it beyond the first tentative taste.  I think that it was the novel delivery that threw him off, not the taste.  I believe that with a larger dog, where one tongue swipe would clear off and refresh the ball, it might be better received.<br /><br />I'm back after trying this with a larger dog with no success.  He just wanted to take the whole thing in his mouth.<br /><br />This seems like a good idea and it might work if you started using it with a puppy as a training device.  Perhaps you could ""train"" older dogs to use it properly, but it is certainly NOT worth the effort to do that."
0,"We have four smallish house type dogs that rule the roost here, so we thought we'd try this new bacon flavored Lickety Stik product on each of them. Reviews were mixed. A couple of them sniffed a lot, but didn't seem to want to partake. The other two licked gingerly, and would continue to do so as long as we squeezed the plastic bottle, but they didn't seem overly enthusiastic. It seemed to take a lot to squeeze the brown goo out onto the plastic head, actually, and it tended to drip off too much at times before they could lap it up. I think it also was bothersome that the plastic bottle looks a lot like a roller-ball underarm deodorant dispenser. Rather bizarre in a way. One of our sons is always teased about liking bacon so much, so at the latest family night supper he was asked if he wanted some Lickety Stick for his underarms. Everyone laughed. Except the dogs. They were trying to do a serious analysis and review. Anyway, maybe some dogs will like this stuff, but our family voted against buying more for our dogs. It was an interesting experiment, and your mileage may vary."
0,"I'm always willing to try something new for my dogs, and this sounded like a great idea, a portable no-mess treat delivery system.<br />The flavor I'm reviewing is ""Smoky Bacon""<br />I experienced some of the same issues noted by other reviewers. The ball in mine did not roll freely, so once my dog licked it clean, I had to manually advance it with my finger. So much for the ""no mess"" aspect.<br /> Squeezing the bottle as suggested by a few only results in a glop of foul-smelling liquid oozing out and dripping on the floor.<br />Yes, I said foul-smelling. I know dogs have a somewhat different take from their people on what smells good and what doesn't, but 3 of our 4 dogs recoiled at the smell of the product. Our only ""outside"" dog would take a lick, then take a sniff of her own rear end...presumably she found the scent similar. If you've ever seen a dog do that, then you know what I mean.<br /><br />I'm also concerned about how sanitary this delivery system is. Between uses you have a ball laden with dog-mouth bacteria multiplying. I doubt rinsing the ball before storage would help much, undoubtably some slobber is going to contaminate the bottle contents during usage. Refrigeration is not suggested on the label but it might help retard bacteria growth between uses.<br /><br />I think this product is another one of those things that sound like a good idea but the execution is flawed. I cannot recommend this product in good faith, and the $7.99 suggested retail price is a little steep for 1.7 fluid ounces of product."
0,"I tried this on three dogs, a border collie, a weiner dog, and a little taco dog. Each one showed an interest in only one of the three flavors, bacon being the top contender (two out of the three), as opposed to the chicken and liver flavors. However, the weiner dog (who has no other known allergies) was clearly allergic to this product -- she sneezed every time she licked it so I gave her no more. She has never sneezed like this before.<br /><br />In summary, with all the treats that are available for dogs these days, even though this one is a low-calorie type, I would pass it by. It seems like a good idea but in actuality, I'm pretty sure that you'll be seeing this product on the sale table at Big Lots before too long."
0,"I usually try to see the good side of things so I'll start with  - my dog liked the taste.  She is an older dog and it takes a lot to get her excited, this did.  As for me, it's messy, and kind of icky when you think about the dog's saliva being put into the bottle every time you roll the ball top.  The top is a roller ball that is very difficult to turn.  You get your fingers sticky with this strong smelling liquid, and it has to be done repeatedly. You can run it along the counter to turn it, also a bad idea. The dog just gets a taste from the ball, then wants to EAT the bottle which, according to the warning label, is a no no.  No eating the roller ball or the bottle!  If they were to get hold of the ball it could choke the dog.  Bad design if you ask me.  OF COURSE the dog is going to want to bite the bottle if it tastes like bacon juice.<br />  I gave her a couple licks and decided to throw the rest away.  Sorry puppy."
1,My dog loves this treat. She loves the taste of it and I like that it lasts a while. Other treats just do not last long with her including rawhides but with the Lickety Stik she gets approx 500 licks. She goes nuts every time I go to twist the top off of it and doesn't stop licking until I finally say that she's had enough. With any dog treat some dogs may not like it but I think it's worth a try to purchase Lickety Stik for your dog at least one time. I have found one problem with this treat which is the roller ball doesn't roll so well sometimes. It gets to one point where my dog licks it and it stops turning which annoys her and annoys me as well because I have to get my hands all messy trying to fix the roller. This is the only gripe I have with this treat but it is also why I deducted one star from the overall review.
1,"I'm not sure exactly what this product is meant to be used for.  I would think it would be great to take on walks for a quick reward.  Just whip it out of your pocket and give your dog a lick.  No where on the product did I see the shelf life or how to store it.  I'm assuming it does not need to be refrigerated.  It looks just like a roll-on deodorant bottle.  It's just liver flavored gravy in a deodorant bottle. It's dispensed when the dog licks the ball.  I got the liver flavor. I don't see this lasting very long.  It's a small bottle.  There is a little ""window"" at the bottom of the bottle so you can see when it's almost empty.<br /><br />I could see these being used for treats in training.  ""Chester"" says it's great!"
1,"I only have i bottle (bacon flavor), so I don't know if it is typical, but the ball does not roll easily.  My dogs can get the liquid treat, but only if I squeeze the tube a bit.  And they aren't small dogs with weak tongues.  They are a Border Collie and a Labrador Retriever.  They do enjoy the treat, thought the Border Collie is not overly enthusiastic.  The Lab is enthusiastic about anything edible, even remotely, edible.  A bit messy as it drips a little when I squeeze it, but then it's not meant to have to be squeezed.  I will check other reviews and if my hard-to-move roller ball is the exception, I will be ordering more of this handy, portable treat which is easy to keep mess-free in a pocket."
1,"Lickety Stik is an all-natural dog treat that comes in a deodorant-like container with a roller ball on top.  The idea is when your dog wants a treat, you give him a few licks of this lo-cal product instead of something more fattening.  Ten licks = 1 calorie.  I wasn't sure what to think about this product at first--great idea or somewhat odd?  My dogs made the decision for me:  they love it!  In fact, when I picked up the bottle to write this review, they both came running.<br /><br />I think Lickety Stik would be especially useful if your dog is on a diet, or when you're training and don't want to give too many high-calorie treats.  This is a winner at our house."
1,"Gracie (our miniature Dachshund) absolutely loves this ""lick stick"".  She comes running when she sees me get it out.  The only drawback is that when I put it back away, she looks  at me like I am the meanest person ever."
1,"I got this thinking my chubby lil dog might benifit from a treat that was tasty but didn't add extra lbs. She's very picky  and I wasn't sure she would take to the new style treat. She loved the Bacon flavor and the hands on attention she got while I held the bottle. Our other dogs loved the  treat as well, the only downside of the treat is that u have to hold the bottle and squeeze it gently for the dog. And one can't be.shared one dog always wants to be first."
0,"Maybe my doggie is just not smart enough for this product?? I'm not sure. It comes packaged like ""Tussy"" Deodorant from the old days. You roll it around and the flavor is on the ball and as your dog licks it, the flavor keeps returning. Ok, what did MY dog do? Try to take the whole bottle. No way was he going to just ""lick"" it... he wanted the container. I obviously couldn't give him the whole thing because he would chew it and the liquid would squirt all over. Very strange ""treat"". If your dog is used to taking treats from you and chewing them up, getting them to just lick might be a trick. Not for Gus."
1,"The dogs like the Lickety Stiks, no question about it.  After one brief attempt to just bite it, the 3-year-old settled in to licking, and the the 11-year-old understood the idea from the start (to be fair, they are both experienced with the concept of licking ice cream and the 'lick it!' reminder may have helped).  I am sure if the Stiks were left in reach, they would quickly chew into them and make a mess, so that's something of which to be careful. They did not drip when held upside down, which was pleasing.<br /><br />I am fortunate that neither of our dogs are overweight or have weight concerns; owners with chubby dogs expressed extensive enthusiasm when I asked them about the Stiks.  The younger dog is not a huge treat hound -- he can often 'take it or leave it,' and these proved no different.  I keep hoping to find the motivator that he just can't walk away from.  The Stiks didn't prove to be his Achilles heel but they are in excellent company in that regard -- both dogs clearly found them palatable and enjoyable.<br /><br />My primary use of treats is in training, and my main quibble with the Stiks is that it is hard to use them to lure... you know how you have a treat in your hand and you allow the dog to nose it but not take it while you lure them?  You can't really do that with these.  They also wouldn't be good when set on a target, as a chunk of bait is. Also, the licks of the rollerball take time, while a small, soft chunk of cheese or liver can be gulped down without any noticeable delay in the action.<br /><br />I found all three 'flavors' to be rather unpleasantly smelly -- I think the manufacturer could maybe dial back the scent and still have plenty of appeal to the dogs.  They were also kind of sticky and did leave a smear if one accidentally brushed the roller-ball dispenser across any surfaces while wielding it.  Our newest vehicle has terribly inappropriate light-colored upholstery (what were we thinking?) and the commercials for the Stiks that talk about keeping one in the car made me cringe -- I would not want these anywhere near light-colored textiles!<br /><br />I'm glad to have tried these but I don't know that I will make a point to purchase them in the future, especially at the current price point."
1,"The main thing I love about this product is that its so good for use during training.  It's so much easier to carry on walks than a bag full of chopped hot dogs or dog treats.  Plus licking has been shown to have a calming effect on dogs which could make this product helpful for reactive dogs.  I like that the ingredients are all natural and there are no ""iffy"" ingredients.  To top it off my picky raw fed dogs love this stuff.  I'm keeping it as a training treat only to keep it special for them.  I would definitely recommend this product and plan on buying lots more!<br /><br />ETA:  I would caution against using this with totally unruly dogs.  If you think your dog would rip it out of your hand and chew it up enough to dislodge the ball I would not use this product as the ball *could* be a choking hazard.  I have pit bulls and they could tear this container apart in 2 seconds flat but they are well trained so I know they wouldn't. I would also caution against leaving it laying around where an unsupervised dog could get at it for the same reason.  But I think the benefits to this product far outweigh the potential dangers as long as your careful about it."
1,"Very handy way of dispensing a reward. Very palatable and dog is eager to get the next lick. Keep's one's hands clean while dispensing the treat. It seems great for training, as it is quick and easy to access and use. Great new product!<br /><br />*Donn (the dog) loves it. :)"
1,"I recently got PetSafe Lickety Stik for my dog, and she loves it!  The product consists of a bottle filled with a flavored liquid, and whenever Tiny wants some all I have to do do is shake the bottle, remove the cap, and let her lick at the roller until she's satisfied.  There are times when she tries to bite the bottle, but I usually solve that by completely upending it so that she can't get her mouth around it.<br /><br />All in all, if you want a treat for your dog that's low on messiness as well as being something that they'll enjoy, then PetSafe Lickety Stik is a good one."
1,"The Bacon Flavor Lickety Stik is like crack cocaine for my dog Rocky. If I handed him the product, it would be gone--plastic and all--within 30 seconds. However, you aren't supposed to ""give"" your dog the Lickety Stick, which works like a roll-on deodorant, the human holds it while the dog licks it. If your dog reacts like Rocky, you'll get a big kick out of it. While the novelty won't wear off for Rocky, I have the distinct impression that I'll get bored with it after a while.<br /><br />On the other paw, Mr. Peabody seemed to enjoy it, but he wasn't as enthusiastic as Rocky. Could it be their difference in age? Mr. P. is six years old and Rocky is one. Rocky also eats everything, including light bulbs, styptic powder, and prescription eyewear, but not with as much vigor as he attacked his Lickety Stik.<br /><br />Our third dog, Charity, sniffed it, looked at me like I had serious issues, and turned away. She's seven. Based on Rocky's & Mr. P.'s enjoyment of the product, I give it five stars; but if Charity was an ""only dog,"" it would get none."
1,"I didn't really know what I was getting when I chose to receive this product, but I love getting my dog new things. I thought it was really funny when I opened it- it looked like a roller-style deodorant! But I tilted the product to get the juice by the roller-ball and let my dog lick it. She loved it and caught on very fast!<br /><br />If you're looking for a treat you can give to your dog and then walk away, this isn't the one. You have to hold it so that he/she can lick it; they cannot eat the plastic part. I think it's a great treat for training. It's easy to carry around and ""operate"" (uncap, tilt, hold in front of dog). I'm using it to teach my dog simple things...she's learning to stay right now, and so I tell her to sit, I walk away, and when I let her come to me, she gets a few licks. It works like a charm!<br /><br />Of course there's the chance that your dog may not like the flavor or might try to chew the bottle instead of licking it. If you're lucky enough to have a dog that likes it/licks it instead of chewing it, it's a great treat to add to the mix! It's something different and new!"
1,"The lickety stick is not a lollipop.  It is a roller that looks similar to roll on deodorant or shoe polish.  Inside is the flavored juice.  When the dog's tongue licks the roller, the juice coats it and the dog gets a taste.  I was sent the liver flavor.  One of my dogs loved it.  He was slow at first, but once the roller got coated with the flavored juice, he just went at it.  He even tried biting it. I had a hard time getting it away from him.  My other dog was afraid of it.  I think he thought it was medicine.<br />So this is an interesting way to give a dog a treat. Kind of fun to sit there and watch him lick it like a lollipop.  My only complaint is the smell was gross.  The bacon flavor would probably smell better."
0,"Pros: Very low-calorie; dogs love the stuff; good for them--nutritious, all-natural.<br /><br />Cons: Stinky; can be hard to get out; you have to stand there squeezing it the whole time (so giving a normal treat is far more convenient); messy. They inevitably drip all over, so you'd better use them over an easy-to-wipe floor, or outside.<br /><br />The way it usually works for me is:<br />*squeeze...squeeze...squeeze*<br />""Where is it?""<br />*liquid starts pouring out; lands on floor because it always comes out on the opposite side of the roller-ball from the dog*<br />With luck, the dogs don't step in it too much, and I can easily go over the area with a damp cloth after pointing out the spots for them to lick up.<br /><br />It's not as ""convenient"" as they'd have you believe. You don't just squeeze, let the dog lick the coated ball, and recap it. This is liquid, and it's going to make a mess and require cleanup. (To be fair, regular treats can leave behind crumbs, slimy goo, etc., as well.) You can travel with it, sure, but I would sure as heck NEVER use it inside my car. Your hands can obviously still contact the sticky end and require washing, and I never feel right screwing the cap back on without first rinsing and wiping off the sticky end. If you don't make a habit of doing this, I'm certain that eventually you'll wind up in a dripping, oozing, gooey predicament. This may be cleaner for your hands than pieces of something else that may be sticky, slimy, and/or odiferous, but it's hardly the neatest thing in the world.<br /><br />Also...""no delay in presenting?"" Hmm. There's typically more of a delay in waiting for the liquid to start dripping out, with the dog sniffing at it and waiting, than there is in fumbling with a treat bag in your pocket. Either way, they know what's coming to them, but speed is not really an advantage of this product.<br /><br />The very concept should make it excellent for training, especially, because that can run you through your allotted treats very quickly. Dogs really can lick as much of this stuff as they want at any given time...one lick is hardly ever enough, but always appreciated. I normally wind up squeezing every few seconds for about 30-45 seconds, maybe a minute or so. It makes a good diet snack because they get something very flavorful, less filling, and more healthful. However, it's so messy that you'd have to keep it somewhere nearby and out of reach during training, rather than inside your pocket.<br /><br />Of course, they put a positive spin on the necessity of standing there holding and squeezing the tube, saying that the administration of this treat provides a bonding time and reinforces to the dog the source of his/her treats. Well, okay. I can't call that untrue, although it is rather unnecessary for anyone whom has as strong a relationship with his/her dog(s) as I do with mine. And they are all definitely well aware of me as a provider (or slave, in the opinion of the dog with the catlike mindset.) You should see them make firm eye contact, then look back and forth from your face to the treat cabinet or room, pointing you in the desired direction! Don't get me wrong, though; it is usually pleasant to stay close to your pet, giving him/her continuous drops of scrumptious meat-flavored liquid as he/she focuses intently on that ball--instead of simply watching them snatch a traditional treat and devour it wherever they feel like at the moment.<br /><br />A marginal amount of bonding may occur while you hold onto this thing for a couple of minutes and the dog laps at the putrid-smelling goo, obviously mocking you for your deficient senses of smell and taste.<br /><br />I tried out the three-pack of liver, chicken, and bacon for my three dogs as stocking stuffers this past Christmas, and we've still got a little bit of bacon and liver left. They obviously last a decent amount of time. I wouldn't be averse to buying them again if I saw them at a fair price in a store, and was looking for a small-portion, different type of dog treat.<br /><br />I haven't used them yet as a ""distraction"" or ""soothing"" technique; I suppose this might work, although you'd clearly need someone else to administer the stick while you did the grooming or whatever you were trying to do. And I wouldn't necessarily expect a dog to keep still just because s/he was licking...not my nutters, anyway. But, it's an idea, at any rate. It might well be a good anxiety-reducing distraction. They do get pretty excited over it, so depending upon the situation, it just might have that power.<br /><br />Edit: I'm sorry, but I had to lower the rating to two stars. You're far better off dripping the tasty, low-calorie liquid onto a hard surface and letting the dog lick it up. It should be sold as a kibble gravy or something to pour into a tiny bowl, rather than as a ""Lickety Stick.""<br />These things really do just splatter all over the floor/ground whilst taller dogs lick SOME liquid from the ball, and shorter ones risk being hit with falling droplets. It's a good idea, but perhaps the substance needs to be thicker, or it needs to pour out neatly into a little tray, or something. Some dogs are better at catching it all before it falls, but height differences make it tricky to try and let two of them share one, if they're both willing. You can do one in each hand, sure, but of course that doubles the mess. The secret, really, is to squeeze slowly and gently, watch for where it starts to emerge, and rotate the ball so that the dog can lick it before it slides around the ball and falls.<br /><br />I somewhat doubt my likelihood to recommend or re-purchase Lickety Stiks, unless they come out with a particularly interesting new flavor, or improve the stuff itself. Furthermore, my dogs have actually begun shrinking away and ignoring them, obviously mistaking the sticks for their tubes of tooth-cleaning gel and spray--not the product's fault, naturally, but still a newly noted disadvantage worth mentioning."
0,I tried with my dogs but they didn't like it at all. I ended up throwing it out .  Very messy.
0,"This is the strangest thing I've ever seen.  Imagine your roll on deodorant container  being filled with some bacon flavored  gravy and then allowing your dog to lick from it for his daily treat!  Are you kidding me?  This idea is gross and unsanitary and how do you get a dog to understand the concept that they are only supposed to take a few licks and that's their treat.  My dog kept trying to grab the container, she thought I was trying to tease her with it.  Finally I started rolling it on the dry milk bone type treats that she's not crazy about to get her to eat them.  If they called it ""Dog Bone Icing"" it might sell better  and make more sense."
0,"As much as our dogs enjoyed Lickety Stik, the cloying stench of ""savory chicken"" repulsed the rest of the family. The odor wafted off the stick and filled the room like a musky air freshener. We called it ""Icky Stik"" or ""Stinky Stik"" as the experience was so nauseating that no one volunteered to reopen the stick, despite pleas from our dogs.<br /><br />We tested the PetSafe Lickety Stik as part of the Amazon Vine program, which is to say the product arrived free. The company sent us the Savory Chicken flavor and we tested it with our Cockapoo and Miniature Schnauzer, both adult females. Neither dog had trouble figuring out how to advance the roller ball so they could taste the liquid. One warning: if you get this stuff on your hands you'll play heck trying to wash it off.<br /><br />A collective shudder ran through the family as we wondered: if Savory Chicken smells this bad, can you imagine inhaling a deep whiff of ""Braised Liver"" or ""Smoky Bacon""? Worse yet, the company touts the product's portability and recommends carrying it in your purse. That's a bit risk since this stuff in the bottle is hardly perfume.<br /><br />The company says Lickety Stick consists of all-natural ingredients. Here's the list from the bottle: Natural Chicken Flavors, Cultured Milk Lecithin, Mixed Tocopherois (Natural Preservative - A Source of Vitamin E), Ascorbyl Palmtate (Source of Vitamin C), Rosemary Extract, Green Tea Extract.<br /><br />In summary, with so many better options available for dog treats, we cannot recommend Lickety Stick because of its foul smell, sticky ingredients and the serious risk to your purse should the bottle leak.<br /><br />Rating: One star."
0,"This product is really dumb and pointless. My dog was simply not interested, and I was not interested in holding it in my hand while she licked it. When I ordered it, I thought I was getting something you could just give the dog, and she would entertain herself for a long time, by licking. It sounded like a good idea because my dog really likes to lick things. I give her something lick-able when I want her to go lay down and be quiet. This product is useless for that purpose. This is an interactive treat. You and your dog both have to interact with it. It gets old, pretty much immediately.<br /><br />The product itself is gross. It's sticky and unappealing. The smell is nauseating. My dog would take a sniff, and sometimes a trial lick, and then just walk away. I'd be left standing there holding a phallic shaped bottle of mysterious smelly goo.<br /><br />Here are some things my dog likes better than Lickety Stiks: dirty diapers, dead pigeons, week-old garbage, and other dog's butts.<br /><br />The only people who really enjoyed the product are the teenagers in my house, who think ""Lickety Stik"" is possibly the most hilarious product name they ever heard. The jokes lasted most of the afternoon. The packaging offers plenty of crude suggestions (""give a lick"" tm  they trademarked that??), as if my kids needed any encouragement. Even the shape of the bottle - a rigid cylinder with a ball on top - was fodder for hilarity. They thought it was just so funny.<br /><br />So this is a stupid product with a funny name and a suggestive shape, which solves no problems, has no appeal beyond comedy, and is completely worthless."
0,"Are we seriously supposed to stand there for hours and hold this bottle up in the air while the dog licks it? This is the new wave of dog ""treats""??<br /><br />To be honest, when I ordered this, I kind of missed the whole ""Likety Stik"" wording on the bottle. I mean I definitely saw the ""Likety"" wording, but didn't pay any attention to the ""Stik"" part. I saw that it was bacon flavored, so I assumed it was a bacon flavored substance almost like a gravy to pour over your dog's food, especially by the shape of the bottle.<br /><br />When it arrived, I was like what the heck is this?? At first glance you would almost assume it is roll-on deodorant, but then you see the picture of the dog in the middle of the bottle, so you know it can't be.<br /><br />But I did try giving this to all 3 of my dogs. None of them knew what to do with it and seemed aggrevated when they licked the ball and nothing would come out. I then figured out I had to squeeze the bottle to make the contents drip out. When I did that, they stopped licking, looked at the ball, took one whiff and turned their noses up in the air as if to say ""ewwww get this thing outta my face right now""!!<br /><br />I find that dogs (mine anyway) like to chew, so they kinda don't know what to do with this odd invention. They aren't rabbits who drink water from a water bottle. This reminded me of something like that. This is for an animal who is used to licking from a rolling ball. You can't exactly give it to a dog, then let them go off on their own with it like a normal treat or a bone, because rather than licking the ball, they would want to investigate what it's made of and would chew it to bits until the contents fell out. In my opinion, not a very good idea and could potentially be very dangerous. I really don't see the point in this item at all, unless of course you are a rabbit."
0,"I decided to try this ""treat"" with my new dog. I am trying to teach her different responses and thought that a treat that did not add calories to her diet would be a good idea.<br /><br />I introduced the treat to her and she ignored it at the beginning. The shape of the container is of one of the old fashioned roll-on deodorants. I moved the ball around to get some of the liquid on it and re-introduced it to my dog. She liked the flavor but was frustrated with it as the ball gets stuck. She tried a few times and ended up yanking the container from my hand and running away with it.<br /><br />She is a very fast dog and when I caught up with her she had managed to rip the ball of the container. Lucky for me she did not swallow the ball as I think it could have killed her. I picked up the ball and threw it away. I could not get container from her as she was busy using it as a chew toy.<br /><br />I will not be buying this product for her as it is hard to use and I do not think that she should be chewing on plastic. The contents were delicious to her as they were a chicken based.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product."
0,"Well when I ordered this product for my dogs I had high hopes that this would be something that they might like.  The concept is that the product looks like a deodorant roll on...if you remember those.  You take the top off, and then there is a roll over which the gravy-like product is dispensed.  The gravy is thick and difficult to get to start dispensing.  Once it does start coming out of the sides of the roller ball, the process of it coming out is inconsistent.  Sometimes it comes out slowly,  then sometimes you have to shake the bottle a  good bit to encourage the gravy to come out around the roll.  This usually means that you are having to futz around with this dog treat much more than you would like to have to.  The dogs also got a little discouraged with the process as well.  They would actually walk off and give up on me with a frustrated look on their face as if to say that this was hardly worth it."
0,"**Vine Voices will receive a total of 3 Lickety Stiks in separate flavors; Savory Bacon, Braised Liver, and Savory Chicken**<br /><br />Above is the description given for the Lick Sticks and the reason that I made that choice. What I received is one lick stick, not three. My Dobie loves Bacon and Liver so I was really looking forward to receiving both and figured he may be interested in the chicken as well. When I opened the envelope and saw just one lick thing I looked at the shipping invoice and it said that the one stik was bacon flavor. So, although puzzled at the lack  of the other two stiks I figured that at least he was getting to lick one of his favorite flavors. Not to be. The tiny bottle, about the size and apprearance of a small roll-on deodorant stick, was labeled ""Savory Chicken Flavor"". I figured I would give it a try and held it for my Dobie to lick. He gave me a scornful look indicating that he failed to find it ""Savory"" and walked away. I tried several more times but he began to give me a look that meant his patience was running thin. He is a large Dobie and very strong so I heeded his message and apologized by giving him a treat that ensured his forgiveness. The lack of receiving three sticks, the shipping invoice labeled as bacon flavored and the actual tiny bottle of disgusting chicken something are all a mystery to me."
0,"I would have preferred to directly inform the company that makes this product vs. writing a review on Amazon but I couldn't find a way to do that.<br /><br />First I would like to thank the makers of Lickety Stik for donating these things to a Canine Cancer walk I participated in this weekend.<br /><br />I have 2 dogs, as it seemed, one dog liked it and the other did not.<br /><br />I screwed the cap back on and put it on the counter while I took a shower and when I came out I found the Lickety Stik butsted open on my couch and leaking all over the place.  The plastic roller ball was no where to be found, when my dog seemed ill I became concerned that she ate it but I found it later, thankfully.<br /><br />I would not buy this product as my dogs are not usually mischievous or eat things that are not edible but this instance was too close for comfort.  I feel the construction of the container is weak."
0,"This was not at all what I expected. It was like the old-school roll-on deoderant from the 1970's. Only instead of fresh-scented anti-persperant, it was drippy, smelly, bacon-flavored dog juice.<br /><br />So I guess you're supposed to stoop down and hold the roll-on bottle in front of the dog while it licks the roller ball to get the dog juice on its tongue. You're supposed to do this without yacking from the smell. Meanwhile, there's a million dog treats out there that you can throw to the dog and he runs off and eats it and you're not doing deep knee bends to apply dog juice roll-on to your dog's already funky tongue.<br /><br />To say nothing of the fact that the dog just wants to take it and bite it. Like a dog would do.<br /><br />Try again. Fail."
1,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:42 Mins<br /><br /></span>Since neither of my 2 dogs can write about this new Lickety Stik, I will do my best.<br />A new idea for treats is always welcomed.  We had 3 flavors of Stiks, Bacon, Chicken and Liver.  We tried all three on both Sundae and Casey.  Sundae licked all three and seemed to like them all. Casey, however, wouldn't try any of the three, just turning his head in apparent disgust (lol).  Having had dogs my whole life, you never can tell what a dog will like or dislike.  I didn't give this 5 stars, because of some functional reasons, not because Casey didn't even try it.  First, the lick ball is exactly like a deodorant ball. As a matter of fact, the container reminds me of an Arrid Rollerball Deodorant bottle exactly.  It doesn't move freely by just licking, you have to gently squeeze the bottle for the liquid to be available to the dog.  If you squeeze too hard, it drips onto the floor. Other than that, it seems to be enjoyable.  It is supposed to be healthy, but I had to use a magnifying glass to read the rather small label.<br /><br />The video is one of our taste tests. Hope you enjoy it."
1,"- UPDATE - 10/28/2011<br />It's been several weeks of using it and there is still a ton of licking left, definitely getting my moneys worth out of this treat.<br />Another thing that has been nice is the ability to keep this in my pocket without making a mess. So going for a walk with it has been nice (and a great way to keep his attention when there are other not well behaved dogs around).<br />- UPDATE -<br /><br />Well the puppy dog has spoken... he loves Lickety Stik!<br /><br />When we first presented it to him he was a bit unsure and tried to bite the stick which was kind of cute but he quickly realized he had to lick it.<br />Now every time the Lickety Stik comes out as a reward or to teach him something, he just can't wait to lick the bejesus out of it.<br /><br />Not only does the dog love it and responds really well to it, it's made in the USA!<br /><br />This is a very unique, clean, easy to use, easy to carry, and fun treat for your dog. I would highly recommend this to most anyone. Way to go PetSafe!"
1,"We have a new puppy, and are attempting to train her using a rewards-based system. This works well, except that we don't feel comfortable giving her treat after treat after treat. Then, along came the Lickety Stik, and it solved our problem! Our puppy LOVES this, and it's become an invaluable training tool. We have bought several in different flavors and keep them in different rooms around the house. When our puppy is doing something she shouldn't be doing, we give her the appropriate command (""Off,"" ""Wrong,"" ""Leave It"" etc.). If she does what she's asked, we say ""Good Girl!"" grab the Lickety Stik, and she gets a couple of licks. This has worked amazingly well, and we're not stuffing the puppy with treats. There are some times when we feel she'll continue the bad behavior just to get a Lickety Stik, but that's the same with any treat. To solve this, once we know she understands the command, if she continues to do the behavior, she doesn't get the treat. She soon realizes that to get the Lickety Stik, she has to not do the behavior at all.<br /><br />Of course, your dog may be different, but this has been our experience.<br /><br />Also, my daughter is working at a local pet store as a grooming assistant, and she tells me that they have started using the Lickety Stik there to help calm their dogs and curb bad behavior while they're being groomed. I felt that was a pretty good endorsement right there."
1,"I am a veterinarian with 7 years experience, and I have 3 Great Danes.  I am always looking for safe, effective, fun, and innovative new pet products.  I saw the video for this product, and definitely agree that carrying a pocketful of crumbling treats isn't much fun for training/rewards, so decided to give it a try.  All 3 of my girls tried to bite the bottle at first (and I think most dogs will), but within a few seconds, all of them figured it out, and were licking away very happily, each taking their turn sitting down for me.  I also recently used it to help keep them standing still while my 8 year old daughter gave them baths outside with the hose on a nice warm day....much less mess than doing it in the tub inside!  It was also handy when we went for a short hike at a local park a while back, as I am training the 2 younger Danes to wear backpacks (that's a whole other story!).  Even if the dogs jump in the river wearing their backpacks and get them soaked, their treats won't get soggy.  The only thing I would like to see is using a liquid treat that's maybe a bit healthier for them...the ingredient list on the Lickety Stik looks like a lot of processed stuff.  It does have a bit of an odor, too, but I didn't find it that strong or offensive like some of the other people here did.  And I think it's the odor that really draws the dogs to come check it out...otherwise, why would they want to just lick a plastic roller ball?<br />Also, I think it would be nice to have a bottle that is just a little bit larger for the large/giant breeds like mine...but this does work well regardless.  Finally, I think it would be great to have a refillable bottle, so there would be less waste...500 licks goes fast when you're training 3 big dogs!<br />Oh, and yes, I will re-order this, and do recommend it."
1,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:29 Mins<br /><br /></span>*disclaimer* I was sent this item to review.<br />Izzy, our mini schnauzer, is very food motivated. Schnauzers have a tendency to get chunky though, so rewarding her with food every time she does a trick is a balancing act between giving her something she likes but not having her snack with treats all day.<br /><br />At 1 calorie per 10 licks, along with a fun interactive way to give her the treat, the lickety safe is fun and healthy. She had no trouble at all figuring out how to lick the deodorant like ball. This would also be a nice travel treat in the car because it closes up and you don't need to get treat on your fingers to give it to the dog."
1,This is a great training aid for all dog owners.  It also eliminates clumped up dog treats that end up in your pocket after you forget to remove them before tossing  you pants into the washing machine!!!!
1,Used the chicken flavor to train my 11 month puppy with his invisible fence.  He loved the treat and my pockets are no longer full of crumbs. Great product!
1,"What I really like about this treat is that it is something you hold while your dog licks it--rather than him taking his chewy someplace and getting busy with it, he ends up looking at me, holding my gaze for as long as I'll let him keep lickin' that rollerball. Awesome for my friend's dog who's old and can't chew. (This is the liver flavor--which smells awesome. The bacon did not ship, but my pup doesn't mind.)"
1,"I thought this looked interesting a liquid dog treat what? So I purchased it, I have two small dogs a seven year old Yorkie and a seven month old puppy Bichon Frise/ Toy Poodle mix. Well I showed it to the puppy I got the liver flavor it does smell bad and let him sniff it he went wild and starting jumping towards my hand trying to get it and barking like crazy I told him sit and paw and he did  and I give him a lick he loved it. Now my Yorkie sniffed it and walked away but she is extremely picky about her treats so it did not surprise me at all. I love how this is small can fit in a jacket and is about the length of your hand opened, this is low in calories 1 calorie in 10 licks and the bottle has 500 licks! this is great I clicker train my puppy and he knows a bunch of tricks but I always felt Like I was filling him up with a ton of treats and then would have to feed him less dinner and I felt bad. But with this I no longer have to worry now it can be messy if your not careful don't squeeze too hard, I will definitely be getting more of this and trying it in different flavors for my Pup Mozart. This is also great for teaching small dogs to heel to stay by your left side and it is great to use outside when the puppy gets distracted by people or other dogs kids etc I can refocus his attention on me and get him to calm down."
0,"This is a really fun idea! It is a fun treat to give them, and my dogs REALLY like it. The reason why I am giving it a low rating, is because it stinks, really bad! The smell is so offensive that my boyfriend won't let me feed this treat to my dogs while he's around. If my dogs didn't love the taste, and if it wasn't so much fun to feed to them, it would be in the garbage. I won't be buying it again, and don't recommend it. However, if you ever find it on sale or find a free sample or something, it is kind of a fun thing to try ONCE. Another issue is the fact that it comes in bacon and beef flavors, which can (and did) stain their mouths and cause dark tear stains."
0,"I have 3 larger dogs - labs and golden retrievers, and I wanted to try this out with them, but it turned out to be basically useless.  None of them can understand that they're not supposed to eat the bottle, and only 1 of my dogs will continue to lick it after he realizes he can't have it.  Another of my dogs got so frustrated with it that she refuses to even lick it if I bring the bottle out.<br /><br />It was an interesting idea, and exactly what it said it was, but, unfortunately, it was a failure at my house.  I can see where it might be useful for smaller dogs or puppies, but definitely not for my dogs."
1,"My dogs love the Lickety Stik! I got the bacon flavor, is there anything better than bacon? I use it to distract Joe when his nails are trimmed, he hates having his nails trimmed. Once I figured out that I need to squeeze it gently because the ball doesn't turn it worked fine. I hold it up and Joe licks it like a lamb with a bottle!"
1,This product is very helpful in training my dogs. I find that it's much more convienant then treats. I will certainly be ordering more.
1,"Both of the dogs love this Lickety Stik. It took one of them a bit longer to figure out the ""roller ball"", but once done, they both love it. I especially like the personal interaction I can have at treat time. My main use has been to use it after giving medicine. It works great and now my girl looks forward to receiving a few tasty licks (her spoonful of sugar!) after taking her medicine. Great, innovative product, at a good price."
1,"Got this for my 9 year old beagle.  She ""expects"" treats anytime she comes back in from outside and has pretty much figured out how to work that system with my 4 year old so she gets treats every 5 minutes (really need to figure out a better lock for the back door!).  I saw this Lickety Stik and the concept seems good.  I had read some reviews about certain dogs not liking this product at all but that is not the case with my beagle.  In fact, she LOVES this stuff and will sit near the counter staring up at it.  My only issue with this product is that it really stinks....and I mean really stinks!!  I try to quickly open it, let my beagle take a few licks and then close it as quickly as possible.<br /><br />It works very similar to how a roll on deoderant would work so if you haven;t used it for a few days, it may take some manual intervention to get the top of the ball wet enough to turn on its own.  I don't have any issues as my dog can easily get it started using her tounge.<br /><br />I will most likely try the other flavors of this since my dog likes it so much.  Plus, assuming this product is accurate in its description, cutting back on the fatty treats she normally gets will be a benefit to her health."
1,"My dog LOVES Lickety Stik in the bacon flavor. Since she likes it so much, I plan on getting the other flavors too. It's a great liquid treat for your dog. I highly recommend Lickety Stik."
0,"I was given a bottle of the savory bacon flavor for the purpose of trying it out and reviewing it. I've tried on several occasions both with the bottle and with putting some on my fingers in case it was how it is dispensed that was bugging her and my dog just wants nothing to do with it.<br /><br />I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 because the concept is interesting and also because my dog is very picky. It's not the first time she's refused a treat, so I didn't think it merited a star rating quite so bad as ""I hate it.""<br /><br />I won't be buying any, though, unless she has a radical change of heart very soon."
1,"Our dog is a hugh White English Bulldog about 3 ft tall and 6 feet long. She loves bacon and loves the flavor of this, but she tries to bite and take the bottle away.<br />The bottle is a roller ball like roll on deodorant, and being a big dog she could choke on this if she did get it in her mouth, which is why we give 4 stars. she loves water out of squeeze bottle and would think this would do better in that type of bottle.<br /><br />I would reccommend this for small to medium dogs, but not for the Mastif breeds."
1,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:22 Mins<br /><br /></span>I selected this item thinking I would try it out on my parents dogs, but when my husband saw it on the counter, he wanted to try it with Kitty. Ha! She hates everything; there is no way she is going to like this stuff. I was wrong. To my total and utter shock, my cat actually liked it. So, here's the video to prove it."
0,"I was surprised when opening the package this product came in and found this ""Lickety Stik"" device.  It looks like a bottle of roll-on deodorant and that's how it works.  My first dog liked it and figured out she is supposed to lick it, but my other dog wasn't sure what to do with it and wanted to chew it.  This is worrisome because if he got hold of it, he may turn it into a bunch of plastic slivers and I wouldn't want him swallowing those.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik treat is a new concept and I understand the idea, but I don't think it's quite there yet.  It's also a little unusual to stand there holding the pets' treat.  Usually, when giving a pet a treat, I expect to get a few minutes of peace and quiet while he/she is enjoying the treat. There are no directions on the bottle, so I wasn't sure how to use it at first, but it didn't take long to figure out.  You just hold it in front of the dog and they have to do the figuring.<br /><br />I probably won't be buying this again."
1,"So, my dog likes it. I'll just get that out there right away.<br />But, it's awkward to carry and can be messy (which I didn't think it would be) but since you have to sometimes give it a little encouragement to get anything to come out, sometimes it just decides ""Oh you want ALL of it!"" and I have a sticky snouted puppy.<br />And, she has since lost interest in it and prefers treats she can smell better."
1,"I can understand this might not be for every dog;  my mother's dog just tried to eat the whole roll-on.  But my dog has no issue with it at all and loves it.  I taught her to recycle using this, and she goes out of her way to find stuff to recycle so she can get some.  It's like feeding a baby lamb out of a bottle.  If you have trouble getting the stuff to come out, squeeze it a little because that gets a little more on the roller ball, maybe that will encourage them to just lick and not chew.  My dog even has fun selecting which flavor we're going to open next."
1,"I decided to try this out after seeing an ad in a Bass Pro Shops catalog. I have two chihuahuas. One of them loved it and could probably lick it all day. The other dog wouldn't go near it. All in all, I think it really just depends on the dog itself; hence the mixed reviews here. It's not a bad product by any means, but probably not something I'll be buying often - just more of a fun treat every so often."
1,"I was resorting to the old trainer's trick of smearing peanut butter on the fridge or a plastic stool, so my new rescue dog could happily lick it off while I brushed him. It worked but it was very messy. Lickety Stik works much better, although I do generally need a helper to hold it while I groom. The big test will come when I next take him to the vet and bring LS along--will it work the same while he's getting his temperature taken? Or will the experience of the thermometer ruin the treat for him? If the former, I'm sure all the vets and techs at our clinic will be ordering this stuff! I was a little concerned with the stuff upsetting my dogs' digestive systems: the new guy has an  iron gut it seems but my other dog has a sensitive tummy. She, however, had some (inserted herself while I was grooming the newbie) and was o.k. We were using liver flavor. Overall, I'm very impressed so far and ordering some more."
0,"This product should have more explicit warnings on the packaging. My husband and I bought this as a treat for our 55 lb Doberman/Boxer mix. He loved the flavor and it served as a great distraction if we wanted to clean his ears or trim his dew claws. Unfortunately, with one swift bite he popped the roller ball into his mouth and down his throat. We needed to rush him to the emergency room where they induced vomiting and then monitored closely for 2 days at home until he threw it up on his own .... After surfing the internet we found numerous other claims with people having the same issue- some even needing to spend a few thousand on procedures to remove the ball.  Additionally, customer service for this company was a HUGE disappointment.  They were unshmpathetic and kept on about how it was not meant for chewing."
0,I was recommended this for my 15 pound rescue dog and her ongoing training.I initially loved the product...till she clamped down on the neck of the bottle sending the small down (roller) down her throat...I was very very lucky as I administered Peroxide immediately and she brought back up after 5 minutes...but please be aware that this can be dangerous
1,I think the packaging is ingenious -- who would have thought to put great meat juices into what looks like a bottle of roll on deodorant!<br />YAAAA -- 10 points for ingenuity !  And the dogs love licking the little roller.<br />If only it was re-fillable !
1,My 2 dogs love licking the treat and I don't feel guilty about too many treat.<br />Excellent to practice commands.
1,"Lickety Stik lickable pet treat from PetSafe are a hit at my house. My dog gets excitement every time I pulled it out.  It seems to be as good as a a moist treat without the sticky mess. A tidy rollerball dispenses all-natural liquid goodness --my dog just lap it up!<br /><br />All-natural flavors, naturally preserved<br />Only 1 calorie in every 10 licks<br />Over 500 licks per bottle<br />No mess roller-ball<br />Great for training<br />Conveniently fits in your pocket"
1,"I still carry regular treats in my pocket but this product is great. It is like a deodorant roll top. It is made in the USA and has only 1 calorie per 10 licks. So far my golden has liked all th e flavors. It is something different and when I am trying to keep his attention on me and not on a passing dog, I have it"
1,"I bought this product hoping to find something that will help me when I am trying to brush my 3 Siberian Huskies.  Lickety works better than I expected, they will stand for 45 minutes to get brushed if I use this.  Huskies are picky in what they will eat, but this is like cat nip to them."
1,"I have a three month old pug puppy who is incredibly food motivated.  Carrying around treats on a walk while I'm leash training him can be a hassle to fish out without spilling the rest or getting crumbs in my pockets.  We received a free sample of Lickety Stik at our puppy training class because of a pug's tendency to pack on the pounds and I was really surprised at how quickly the puppy took to it.  He will do tricks and readily follow on the leash to get a lick of this treat and becomes excited when he sees the bottle.<br /><br />The main drawback to this thing is that it stinks to high heaven and if I get a strong whiff of it the thing makes me gag.  The dog loves it, however so I am really considering buying more of this product in the future."
1,I got the Lickety Stik through the Vine Program.  I was a little skeptical upon ordering.  I have two dogs that both need daily medications and they also get vitamins.  It was always a battle to get them to take either and had to revert to the shove down the throat and blow on the nose tactic.  That is until now.  Put a little of this stuff on whatever they need to take and wham gone down the throat.  It took about a week and then I stopped using it and the dogs now take their pills without any treatment.  Highly recommend and made my life a little easier.
0,"This is a really fun idea! It is a fun treat to give them, and my dogs REALLY like it. The reason why I am giving it a low rating, is because it stinks, really bad! The smell is so offensive that my boyfriend won't let me feed this treat to my dogs while he's around. If my dogs didn't love the taste, and if it wasn't so much fun to feed to them, it would be in the garbage. I won't be buying it again, and don't recommend it. However, if you ever find it on sale or find a free sample or something, it is kind of a fun thing to try ONCE. Another issue is the fact that it comes in dark flavors, which can (and did) stain their mouths and cause dark tear stains."
1,"Great training aid. Very easy to use.  My puppy will follow this Lickety Stik anywhere!  After a while, just shaking the container gets her running to me."
1,"Many of these reviews seemed to be confused. This Stik if really created and used for training dogs/puppies. It is much easy to give them a quick lick when they walk next to you instead of giving them lots of treats or clicks. This product is a god-send. My puppy loves it and walks much better on the leash as a result. Also, just because you dog doesn't like the taste doesn't mean this deserves a poor review. Dogs have different tastes! For what this does, it deserves a better rating."
1,"This is great stuff!  I have a dog w/ no teeth and he could not have treats w/ the others.  Problem solved!  He LOVES this.  It's a bit messy but I've learned how to ""administer"" the treat w/ minimal dripping.  My others beg for it but I save this for my 19 y.o. toothless guy.  What a pleasure to be able to reward him too after potty call!"
1,"Likety Stik is a great product for some dogs obviously, but Foxy, my ten-year-old standard poodle, is not interested. She first thought she was to take the entire container into her mouth. When I didn't give her the opportunity to try to swallow the whole thing, she tasted the juice on the ball. Deciding it was pretty good, she looked around to see if any other dogs might just have happened to come by for a visit. She is a picky eater. When she reacts by looking to see if any other dogs are around, it is evident that something is extra tasty. If she really, really likes something super tasty, she doesn't take the time to look around for other dogs. She has licked it a few times, but she seems somewhat reluctant. The low-calorie idea is neat, but my picky eater needs all the calories she can get.<br /><br />From a people's perspective it seems a good product, but no matter how much I shake it, I find it necessary to turn the ball manually to make the juice available. It would be fun to try this stick on a dog with more enthusiasm about food.<br /><br />Four stars."
1,"Our dog really likes this thing.  It smells like it is full of flavor, and he seems to really enjoy licking the thing for as long as I'll hold it for him.  If you are unfamiliar, the flavored juice in the container is released each time the dog licks a small ball at the tops of the container; as the ball spins, it gets covered in the juice, which the dog licks off, etc.  So, well done!  My one beef with the product, though, is that the ball is a little tough to get spinning until it is fully lubricated, which means that I often have to use my fingers to get it started, which isn't ideal because I don't want to get any of the flavored juice on me.  That said, my dog is a big fan of this product.  So, while I think this is a good product, I'm giving it four stars because I think the delivery mechanism (ie the ball) isn't the best, and could be improved upon."
1,My dog loves this and she has learned amny tricks fast.  The best part is that it doesn't put weight on her.  I use it all the time.  Highly recommned it as a traiing aid.
1,"Yes, this must be very good, all of the dogs loved it, and didn't want to stop licking it.  They lined up waiting their turn.  Would recommend as a treat."
0,"My dogs seem to find Likety Stik extremely tasty as demonstrated by their desire to keep licking it. On my part, however, there are some reservations.  I have the liver flavor and for one, it is one of the worst smelling doggie treats that I have.  Not too sure if people want to carry this around in their purse. The stick works like a rollerball, like some of the anitperspirants you see out on market.  When you first open, it does not roll very easily, but eventually it will get going after your dog licks it a few times.  The second major reservation that I have is that if it is being licked, then the part my dog just licked cleaned, saliva and all, goes back into the fluid reservoir which doesn't seem too clean to me. Some may argue that this shouldn't make any difference to my dog who loves licking his hooha and whose favorite appetizer is cat poop, but I cannot help to think that this may be a festering ground for bacteria.  This may be prevented by having certain chemicals present that inhibit this possibility, but then it loops back to my concern of feeding these to my dog.  Although novel, I don't really see a benefit of having this as a treat other than the caloric count."
1,"I got the savory chicken flavor for our dog, and he totally loves it. He'll perform any trick just to get some licks. It's easy to use and there's no mess. Great idea for a product! I plan to buy more!"
1,I have 2 large dogs who I allow to lick this every day. They seem to like it.  It must smell and taste good to them.  I like giving this to them as a treat for doing something good instead of something with a higher calorie content.
1,"I tried this product on a new dog I had in training, because I liked the idea of a liquid for increased reward value.  It has turned out to be a great reward for many dogs I work with as well as a great reward in numerous situations.  In many performance sports you need to be very careful when rewarding your dog on a practice field that there are no crumbs left behind.  This product is PERFECT!!  I also don't need to worry about my pockets getting eaten out of my pants after training.<br /><br />My advice is to watch the price you pay here!!!!  I buy mine locally at less than 1/2 the price you see advertised here.  Even Petsafe will sell it to you for $8.99 not $13!!!<br /><br />Otherwise certainly a 5 star product!!!!!"
1,"We have two little dogs and they have shared the licks.  I can't speak to the taste, but I feel like I'm giving them puppy crack because they became very upset when I put the stick up.<br /><br />As a human, I'm a little less enthused about the whole thing.  First, it's more like a bottle of shoe shine than a bottle of deodorant.  So, as you turn it upside down, you have to squeeze the bottle a smidge to bring the liquid to the ball.  Squeeze too hard, and your dog will get a face full of Lickety Stik juice.  The dog doesn't mind, though.<br /><br />Both dogs started to try to chew the bottle.  They sort of got the hang of it, but I'm not sure that I'm giving them a life lesson here or anything.  It's certainly not worth the patience, for instance, used in showing a toddler how to drink from a straw.<br /><br />Still, as a novelty, I'm cool with this.  I really do think the dogs will get militant when the bottle runs out, though.  For all I know, it's just sugar water, but whatever it is, they really like it."
1,"The five stars are from Panda the Puppy.  This thing smells horrible, and looks disgusting, but the puppy loves it. He loves it so much that I can tolerate the horrible smell for him.  Panda loves treats, like most puppies, but this treat in particular gets his attention. It is working as a great training aid too.  He sits, he licks.  It is a treat that he is motivated to work for, and it makes training easier. We do have other treats that work, but this one has the benefit of a fast grab. I don't have to dig in a bag or really search for it."
1,"This is like a deodorant bottle with gravy in it.  My dogs took to it right away and did every trick as if I had a chunk of steak in my hands.  I figure it's a lot cheaper than conventional treats and not as messy as wet ones.  You do have to squeeze the fluid out sometimes so if they aren't ready for it, it drips.  If you aren't over a rug or other cloth surface it's not a problem, because they'll lick it off the floor.  I do have to keep it out of reach when I'm not using it because I'm afraid they'd jump up when I'm not looking and run off with it for me to discover it all chewed up with a stained carpet under it!"
0,"My dog was pretty confused when I put this in his face. Whenever I do he'll lick it once or twice then step back and look at me like, ""Can I have a real treat now?"" At least he doesn't hate it, but he sure doesn't get excited about this whenever I pull it out.<br /><br />But don't go off my review alone, other dogs seem to like it. Just not my poodle."
1,"OK, so my dog loves this and she is a picky eater.  I literally had to force her mouth open and give a roll of it on her tongue and she has been hooked ever since.  I usually only give her high quality treats and chews but I figure a few licks of this roll on won't her her.  I don't think I will buy it because it really is not a healthy treat for her but since she likes it and it does not make a mess I gave it 4 stars.  If it was better nutritionally I would have given it 5 stars.  This is definitely a great concept!  I just wish is contained better ingredients.  : )"
1,"This is the most unique dog treat I've seen. The liquid treat is dispensed from a container that reminds me of a large lip gloss tube with a roller. I've given this unique dog treat ""4 stars"" instead of five as an average based on the varied reactions from my two small dogs. The smaller Malti-poo loved the treat and from his reaction would give it ""5 stars"". He immediately licked the roller, received the treat, and wanted more. Our Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a pickier eater in general and wouldn't even try it at first. He finally did, but didn't seem to like it. We have the chicken flavor and it may be he just didn't like the flavor.<br /><br />Since our Malti-poo likes it so much, I have just ordered the three-pack that has chicken, liver, and bacon flavors. The three-pack is a better value than the individual packs and I'm hoping our Cavalier will like one of the other flavors better than the chicken. This is a unique idea to reward dogs with a treat without filling them up like traditional dog treats.<br /><br />** Update:  I ordered the three-pack and my Cavalier definitely likes the bacon flavor much better than chicken!"
1,"I came across this PetSafe Lickety Stik and decided to give it a try.  We just got an 8 week old Bassett Hound puppy and decided to try out this Lickety Stik as a training reward due to its low calorie content.  Bassets are know to get fat quick so a low calorie reward is needed as Bassetts basically only respond to food.<br /><br />Basically, this thing has the same construction as a stick of roll-on deodorant.  You turn it upside down, the liquid inside saturates the ball in a second or so and your dog takes a lick or two of the ball.  It works fantastically for training a puppy or dog.  We got the bacon flavor and she absolutely loves it.<br /><br />The puppy loves it and will do anything to get a lick of this thing.  It smells terrible to us(a really disguisting rancid bacon odor)but she absolutely adores it.  The price of $8 may seem a little high, but we've have been using the same Stik for over a month now, numerous times each day and we still have a third of it left.  We will definitely be buying more of these.<br /><br />Lickety Stik is a fantastic product that is great for training or just a treat.  Highly recommended!"
1,"Imagine doggie treat flavored underarm deodorant.... have to squeeze just a bit to get the roller wet, then turn upside down and let the dog lick it. Unique idea.  Would probably be useful as a training tool. Our dog definitely likes it.  I imagine this works best as a daily treat. I shudder to think what would happen if you let the roller dry out, dog ends up with a tounge rash trying to push the roller past the dried out spot... or worse, squeeze to hard and drip doggie treat juice all over!! I'm just saying...  :)<br /><br />All in all, worth a try for the dog that has everything or just needs a change of taste...<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay"
1,"I have two dogs, one Black Labrador and one Chihuahua.  The Lab can't get enough of this stinky treat and even tries to grab it from me with her teeth.  She will lick on it all day if I let her. The Chihuahua sniffs it and snubs it. She couldn't be less interested. So, one out of two dogs loves this stinky treat.  Humans, on the otherhand, hate the strong smell.  I think it's fun and can imagine it is a great treat substitute for obese dogs who need to watch their calorie intake. If you aren't adverse to strong odors you'll love the handiness of this Lickety Stik!"
1,"I am only reviewing the Bacon flavor, but my dogs picked up on how this works pretty quickly and love the taste of it.  At first they wanted to bite the bottle and chew it like a treat but I worked with them for about a minute or so and they got down that you only lick it.  I have 3 dogs and all three of them liked the taste of it.  I like it because it seems like a more personal treat than just a dog biscuit.  I recommend this!"
0,"I am of the curious sort when it comes to dog treats and new ways to reward dogs so I jumped at getting this product.<br /><br />Lickety Stick arrived and three dogs were eagerly sitting in front of me; a cocker spaniel, a norwegian elkhound, and an australian shepherd.<br /><br />I unwrapped the stick and squeezed a little juice out of the tube onto the roller. I presented it to all three dogs. The cocker spaniel and the aussie eagerly licked away. The aussie licked away so much the cocker needed a wet cloth over the top of her head due to dropping juice on her head. The elkhound however, wanted no part in it.<br /><br />After a couple days of using it and trying it out I am left with the premise that it's an interesting take on a a dog reward - but in the end, the execution and possibility of making a mess leave this treat stuck in the treat drawer. I don't see myself buying these in the future."
1,"I guess I didn't really read the description of this product very well, but this was not what I expected! It is like a little roller ball of deodorant only it is filled with liquid log treats. (this one is bacon) It was easy to open, but I did have to squeeze the bottle a little and then roll the ball around to get the initial liquid to come out. Once my dog realized what she was supposed to do, she was ALL OVER IT. In fact, she got so excited that she made her self sick. I'm saving this one for an ""every now and then"" treat."
1,"What a great idea for a treat.  Lickety Stik is constructed like a roll-on deodorant with a flavored dog treat inside.  Hold the Stik upside down and my dog licked away at it.  It is low calorie (great for my dog who is on a diet). It is also very easy to carry.  I keep it in my pocket.Since it has a cap and has plastic construction, it doesnt get crushed in my pocket. It makes a great little reward during training sessions.<br /><br />I find it especially helpful to reward my dog when Im teaching him a new trick. With the lickey stik he was very eager to see the stik come out.<br /><br />A few notes on the Lickety Stik's use.  The first time you use the Lickety stik, you may have to move the roller-ball with your fingers to get the treat to flow a little.  Once the dog understands that licking the ball makes the treat flow, it is not an issue. Also when he is done licking, there is no dripping.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik also has a clear window at the base of of the bottle so you know when it is time to reorder.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik is not large which makes it easy to trasport. However it does mean that if it is your primary treat for you dog, you may run out quickly.<br /><br />Overall, I can say that the dog was enthusiastic about the stick. It was easy to use. It was fun to give. I am happy with this product."
1,"When I picked up the padded envelope from our mail basket, my cocker spaniel snapped to attention.  By the time I had the bottle out of the envelope, the Rottweiler had joined us.  Their anxiety grew as I struggled to break the plastic wrap around the top.  Finally I had the bottle ready for action, after a very long 30 seconds.<br />I had to rub the roller ball to get the liquid inside to lubricate the ball.  Squeezing the bottle forces the liquid to ooze around the ball.  Both dogs wanted to eat the bottle rather than lick the ball.  They give it a five-star review and suggest that the Vine program send more to our house.<br /><br />The rottie still wants to eat the bottle. The cocker has learned the licking technique.  The cocker is quite responsive to the sound of the bottle being shaken. (Cockers are the original foodies.)<br /><br />The major problem I have is that the ball does not move freely.  I get some liquid on the ball and hold it out for the cocker.  She licks it very clean.  Then I have to squeeze more liquid out and roll the ball around with my thumb.<br /><br />The ingredients seem to be healthy, or as healthy as something with bacon fat in it can be.<br /><br />This product can be a great training reward, but you will have a sticky thumb. The first time I offered my thumb to be licked clean, the cocker started to eat it. If you are training your dog, you probably will want a rag to keep your thumb clean.<br /><br />My vine review philosophy is to first test the product without regard to price.  Now that I have checked the price, currently around $8, it seems a good value for a training tool.  $8 does not buy a decent size bag of training treats.  And the dogs are much more responsive to the bacon than to freeze-dried lumps.  However as just a treat for being a good dog in general, it is not as satisfying as a regular-sized biscuit.  Pity my poor dogs who are only getting this one bottle of bacon treat."
1,"First off, i would have to say that I did not find the Bacon flavor to be appealing at all.<br /><br />OK I'm kidding.  I didn't actually lick it.<br /><br />But my dog did, and she loves it.<br /><br />The basics:<br />The container is like a roll-on antiperspirant.  If you use roll-on deodorant, and buy this product, you may accidentally sport a new aroma if you are particularly groggy in the morning.<br />Its a no-calorie treat if your dog is ... uh... ""easy to see"" as they say.  My dog is a bit thick (like a barrel on stilts), so I had some high hopes for this product.<br /><br />The pros:<br />My dog loves it.<br />Its low calorie.<br />No crumbs!<br /><br />The cons:<br />You can't throw it in the laundry room as an easy way to get them to be put up.<br />I had to hold it upside down, and it would drip.<br />When my dog is aggressive she threatens to take it away from me.<br /><br />Overall, I would say that this is one of the few products that delivers exactly what it promises.  I recommend it."
1,"For those that follow my reviews you know I have many dogs so I just had to try out this product.  It was so funny the day I received it. I was surrounded with furry friends. Incase you don't know dogs can smell just about anything and they knew something was in my hands that they were going to like.  The container reminds me of roll-on deodorant.  I know that sounds gross but nevertheless it did. It is made where the dogs lick the top of it to receive their treat.  Okay, now all I had to do was let the dogs lick it and believe me they were ready.  They piled around me and all took their turns, it was so cute.  Now, did they come back for more?  You bet they did, each seeing who could get their tongue on it first.  I could tell to them it was a tasty treat and for me it was a time to interact with my animals and show them love. You can't just let them play piggly wiggly and lick it all in one day, because they would, believe me. You have to allow only so many licks.  I liked this product and so did my dogs and plan to purchase it for them. Dog biscuits are of course a lot easier, you just throw them and they catch, but this is a special treat that allows you time with your animal. Nice product."
1,"The Lickety Stik is fabulous!  My dog immediately took to it and gets so excited when he sees the bottle.  I have been trying to train him to fetch a ball and then give it back to me, but I have had to wrestle the ball away from him.  I was worried about giving him too many treats because of calories, not to mention the expense.  I started letting him lick the Stik once or twice each time I got the ball away from him.  It didn't take long before he would drop the ball when he saw the Stik, and now he puts it directly into my hand, just so he can lick the Stik. I plan on using it to train him to do other things, as well.<br /><br />Considering how many times I have used it, it is a good value for the money.  It's kind of awkward to give him as a regular dog treat, so I save it for training and give him dog biscuits or other treat."
0,"First of all, let me say that my dog likes the taste of this treat - a lot. However, I have a large dog...and evidently an impatient dog. Rather than lick this ""roll-on"" treat, she would rather just bite it and chew it. That's really the only down side. Found out my daughters kitten liked it too. It's weird, like a 1980's deodorant company trying to do something profitable with their out of date product line. I wouldn't buy it, but my pets liked it."
0,"I was excited to get the Lickety Stik for my dogs. It sounds like a good idea BUT the roller part DOES NOT roll and in order for the dog to get something to taste you must squeeze the container which can be a mess. I have four dogs, as I dog train in obedience and in tracking. In the beginning all four were interested, but then they all became frustrated with it. I ended up with $25.00 of this garbage. SAVE YOR MONEY.it's not worth it!"
1,"I have three beagles and a lab.  To be honest, when I read about this product, I was dubious as to its ability to make them happy.  A lick?  That's it?<br />Well--I was right, and wrong.<br />When I first broke it out, the lab tried to eat it--he wasn't happy with the one lick.  The beagles saw him try to eat it, and then they were all about eating it, too.  But once they realized what it was all about, they LOVED it.  They were like crack addicts.  I put it on the dining room table, out of reach, and we kept catching them walking on their hind legs, noses over the table ledge, trying to get it.  They got so sneaky!  Climbing onto the chair?  Really?  When it was time for bed, when they usually get a cookie, they all ran to the table and gave me the distinct message--""WE want THAT!""<br />Last night I put the Lickety Stik on a tall shelf in the hallway of the house--and this morning, they ""knew"" exactly where it was, and wouldn't leave the hallway until I grabbed the thing and walked them outside.<br />So, we're calling it either crack for dogs or catnip for dogs haha..<br /><br />It's sort of like a roll-on deodorant style container.  The beef-gravy-like substance covers the ball and they simply lick it off.  Of course, as I said above, they will try to eat it at first, until they get the idea.  Although I'm convinced that should it get left within reach, they will eat the entire container.)<br /><br />It's a small container--about 5 inches long.  The picture made me think it would be much larger."
0,"My two dogs apparently loved the scent and taste based on the way they were all over the Stik as soon as I uncapped it. The problem was the roller ball. It didn't roll very well. This became the pattern -- place thumb on ball, roll, let dogs lick off residue, place thumb on ball, roll again ... It became tedious very quickly. My main dog grew impatient and latched onto the bottle with his back teeth, easily piercing the neck allowing the flavored goo to ooze out. I tossed the Lickety Stik lickety split."
0,"This product is a bit odd, to say the least. It is designed in a roll-on deodorant type of bottle and your dog must lick the rolling ball to enjoy his treat.<br /><br />When first trying to get my dog to try it, he really looked at me, looked at the bottle, looked at me, looked at the bottle etc. You could literally see in his eyes that he was wondering what the heck he was supposed to do, or what I wanted him to do. Finally he took a swipe at it with his tongue. I assume he was unimpressed because he made no effort to go for another lick, despite my encouragement.<br /><br />The whole idea is just weird. I give my dog treats as well..treats, or to reward good behavior, or just to be nice, or to get him to lay/settle down for a little - in other words to keep him busy for a few minutes or so. This type of treat obviously goes against the idea of keeping him occupied for awhile while keeping my time free since you have to sit/stand there and hold the bottle for him. Now, don't get me wrong, we always have a variety of snacks on hand and I would not mind standing there holding this bottle for him if he actually liked the treat. It's just one of those little extra things we do to show our love. However, he just seemed to not like the taste once he did figure out to lick it, otherwise I assume he would have continued to lick.<br /><br />The texture of the liquid inside just looks gross to me. It is a clearish, somewhat dark brown color. Kind of like pancake syrup although not as sticky/tacky.<br /><br />If your dog will lick the roller ball and likes the taste, then I guess it is a good buy, but if not it is obviously a waste.<br /><br />I also cannot help but wonder who sat around and thought ""Hmmmm, let's create a liquid dog treat and put it in a roll-on deodorant dispenser!!"""
0,"My dogs would not lick it or even pay attention to it. I thought it would be great for training as I am a consumate treat ""dropper"", but they were not the least interested. Too bad"
1,"My wife loves Hershey's chocolate.  I prefer Marabou, but I indulge her now and then with these fantastic Hershey's Golden Almond bars that used to be sold at retail but now are apparently very difficult to find.<br /><br />The box arrived promptly and was packaged well, included 5 bars as per the description, and they were all gone in a flash, so I guess they were good!<br /><br />If you like Hershey's Golden Almond and can't get to Hershey World, buying online is the way to go.  Enjoy!"

1,"I am in the midst of a transition from regular caffeinated coffee to decaf. I've had the caffeine withdrawal headache and my husband has been patient through the.... well-- grumpiness. Searching for a decaf coffee that actually tastes good had me daunted, weeping, wailing, gnashing my teeth...<br />Then I tried this one. It smelled good when I ground the beans.... It smelled wonderful as it brewed... Then the taste test...<br />Results: Deep mellow chocolate, rich velvet caramel... This coffee is so good it's ridiculous!!! AND it didn't cost more than I could afford. Thank you."
1,"Wow, a brownie in a coffee cup & zero calories!!  It's hard to find decaf coffee with a good taste -- this product really fits the bill."
1,My husband is type 2 diabetic and this is best sugar free we have found.It is much cheaper here than in stores where you can only get a small package.
0,"I ordered the case due to the five-star review and the good pricing here on Amazon.<br /><br />Well, I'm stuck with these packages now of noodles I don't want to eat again. I've had healthier, whole grain, even organic versions of pasta/noodles that manage to preserve a nice flavor and normalish texture.<br /><br />These did not. The graininess is offputting. There is no nice pasta/noodle flavor. It just like wet cardboard.<br /><br />At least they're good until 2010. I may find a recipe that they'll work with. Or I can start giving them away, package by package. :)<br /><br />Mir"
1,Delicious! We could not find these locally and we're so happy to find them on Amazon.  Great texture.  Delicious in Chicken-a-la-king casserole!
1,The Hodgson yolkless whole wheat noodles hold their shape and provide great taste to traditional noodle recipes.
1,"I use many types of salt in my cooking but it wasn't until I tried this sel du Guerande that I realized I'd been missing the boat.  This is simply the best.  It has a clean taste of the ocean without the ""dirtyness"" other salts can impart.  Use it as a condiment, sprinkled on after cooking."
1,"Fleur de Sel gives more intensity to salad dressings and is the moist, caviar of salt that is hand raked from the surface of salt ponds on the coast of France during July and August. You will need a mortar and pestle to grind the salt if you use it in recipes, but it is so worth your time.<br /><br />This salt has a distinct salty-from-the-sea flavor that is unique to these salts. The flavor just fills your entire mouth. Normal table salt will pale in comparison and almost has a chemical aftertaste in comparison to this highly prized salt.<br /><br />French chefs have known this secret forever and when I found this salt, I told everyone I knew about the flavor. Sprinkle this salt onto anything you want just before serving, especially good on steaks or freshly cooked vegetables. Also delicious with butter and rosemary on freshly baked bread.<br /><br />Want to taste the best caramels ever? Look for Fleur de Sel Caramels. They will not last long.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
1,I bought this an a cheaper alternative to the Le Saunier De Camargue Fleur de sel.<br /><br />It is not bad but I will stick with the Le Saunier product which you can find here:<br /><br />[...]
1,"I learned about this salt while visiting Arcachon, France and observing my friend cooking in her kitchen.  When I asked about it, her husband conducted a taste test with regular table salt used in the US and Fleur de Sel from Guerande.  The table salt tastes bitter and over powering compared to the lovely mild flavor of this hand harvested sea salt.  So when I got home, I ordered myself some.  There is a huge difference in the flavor of foods I'm cooking now!"
1,i've used non-iodized sea salt for sometime but recently discovered this particular brand. it's one of the best i've tried & really nice on fish & hamburger patties or roast in the slow cooker....
0,"This salt is very very 'salty' with a somewhat bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />There are better products (search for South African East Coast sea salt).<br /><br />I much prefer Maldon's, which is hardly gourmet."
1,"This is a must have snack.  If you like lemonheads and almonds you can't go wrong.  I found these in Walgreens so I decided to give them a try.  I was hooked!!!! They are addicting.  I have been looking all over for the Lemonhead Almonds.  Luckily, Amazon came to the rescue and I was able to purchase two bags.  You won't regret buying them.  Yummy!!!!!"
0,"I bought these thinking they would be sour Lemon-Head covered almonds. The idea of the flavor contrasts intrigued me. They didn't taste a thing like Lemon-Heads and they weren't even remotely sour. That should be enough to claim false advertising. To add to this the shell was particularly hard, like ""boston baked beans"" shells and the flavor of the coating was not good. I wouldn't call it a terrible flavor, just mildly un-enjoyable. The flavor I could best describe it as would be the ""lemon scent"" in cleaning products. The almonds were fine."
1,"I love these, I would recommend to anyone. These bars are so addictive. If you like blueberry you are guranteed to like these."
1,"is the best my dog is crassy about this treat<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050AM90O"">AKC Weight Mgmt Nutritionally Enhanced Dog Treat</a>how much i can say is the best but i can funded in the store,i have to here to funded and by the becase is realy good"
1,"I love buying dogfood on Amazon.  You are able to buy quality food, normally at a discounted price, and the shipping is free if it's fulfilled by Amazon.  It's a no brainer!  Why go to the store and lug a 30 lb bag of dogfood around when you get get it shipped to your house 2 day mail for free.<br /><br />So, if you're skeptical of buying dogfood on Amazon- don't be! I've been doing it for at least a year or two.<br /><br />Now, for this food specifically: It's high quality and my dogs like it.  I also noticed that when I purchased Wellness my dog had the WORST gas ever.  THis does NOT give my dog bad gas.  I do notice that the dogs eyes are a little gunky (which I heard can be attributed to their food) but not more gunky then when I was giving them the Costco Nature's Domain Salmon and sweet potato. (Also, a good deal but you can only buy at Costco)Their coats feel nice... and they have normal bowel movements.<br /><br />Overall, good deal and i recommend."
1,"nowfood ow this is a great product even though I was surprised and even a bit sceotical to buy dog food on amazon ;), delivery was ok, I wasn't in a rush that is and the product is as good as advertised, high in protein and no byproducts which makes for agile, happy and active dogs. I had a Catahoula female and she seems to love the pebbles which as an additional benefit clean hER teeth though they could be ideally larger in size, the pebbles ;) not her white teeth..."
1,This is a superb olive oil for salads. It is very pricey however. So it is to expensive to use for cooking.
1,"I received a gift basket from a client in Oregon today and it included the spicy Fatcat Pretzels made by Fatdog.  These are crazy spicy and I can't stop eating them!!  Soooo good!!  I'm in TN and I want to order more, but the $6.95 shipping is the killer for this deal since the price is only $4.95, or I'd order them from Amazon, but I can't justify paying almost $12 for a little bag of pretzels.  Hey fatdogmustard, how about cutting a deal on shipping?  If I could buy a really big bag, then I would pay that to ship them.  They are soooo addictive!"
1,"I recently tried these, after usually sticking to the Black Bean Sea Salt flavor.  These are certainly different from that flavor, but just as enjoyable.  The cheese flavoring is the perfect flavor for my pallet.  I won't switch to these from the Sea Salt ones, but will definitely add them to my chip rotation.<br /><br />Since these are fried in oil, they are by no means a health food, especially if you are focused on calories. That said though, they are an excellent snack and a much healthier alternative to potato chips or corn chips.<br /><br />The main thing that surprised me about these chips is how good they taste. To me, they taste just as good, and are just as fulfilling, as the other salty crunchy snacks that I tend to munch on in the evenings. I enjoy them plain out of the bag, and also find that they are good with salsa or dip.<br /><br />I wish the price was a little lower on these and wish that the bags contained less air and more chips, but otherwise I think they are great. I highly recommend that you try them.  The pricing here on Amazon, is usually about 30 cents per 6 ounce bag cheaper than what they charge at the local grocery store, HEB.  Specialty stores like Sprouts and Whole Foods charge even more for them."
1,"I bought this product on a whim when I was searching for something else. I am so glad I did! We love to sprinkle this on homemade pizza of just about any kind!  It adds a gourmet touch to any pizza, whether it's a specialty pizza made with mediterranean flavors, or even just a cheese pizza for the kids.  I look forward to seeing what other dishes I can make a little more delightful with a spoonful of sundried tomato sprinkles!"
1,My dogs love this dog food. They seem to prefer the souffle style wet foods that don't have a lot of chunkiness. This is one of those products. They also love the Cesar brand bacon and eggs souffle style dog food that comes with the pink lid. Great product. Arrives in a nice plastic case that has indentations to insert each of the dog food trays. Makes storing in the cabinet really simple.
1,"I gave this five stars because I've never known a dog who won't ""gobble"" these Cesar foods.  Yet, my Vet scolded me (""Misty's getting chubby) and says this food is sinfully rich (& fattening).  He put her on a ""healthy diet"" and she's not very happy.  Feeling sorry for her, I mix a small portion of the Cesar with her 'healthy' dry food.  She normally finds the Cesar, and leaves most of the dry food.  If you've got a skinny dog, with a picky appetite, this is for you!"
1,"My maltese always each all of her cesar products, not only this food but all of the foods prepared by Cesar.  I will continue to buy them for her."
1,I have two Westies and a Maltese. We tried many brands of canned food that they didn't like before we found Cesar's.  All three love this flavor!
1,"Our westies love the Caesar Canine Cuisine foods, they seem to prefer the pates to the sauced varieties, but they eat all of them. I like to give them a big variety of flavors and Caesar's food comes in so many wonderful flavors. This is one of their favorites.  And it is a better deal than in the stores.  So that is super for me."
1,"Convenience size container. Food is always fresh. I have one 10 lbs baby that should weigh 8 pounds so Vet suggested cutting her food back and adding canned green beans. The gravy is just the right amountto flavor the green beans and she loves it. So much, I have had to do this for my not over wgt dog, too. Great Product and delivery."
1,"My 7 pound poodle was always resistant to eating until we tried the sunrise products from Cesar.  Now he eats breakfast every day!  For additional goodness, remove lid and mircowave for 15 seconds....your dog will go crazy for it!<br />I have now purchased this to be delivered every two months--subscribe and save is a great deal for this item!"
1,"I have a basenji dog that is a bit ""picky"" and will not eat some dog foods (I have tried several of the ""premium"" and ""super-premium"" dog foods.<br /><br />He loves several of the Cesar Canine Cuisine foods and this is one of his favorites.  There is never any hesitation when I put his food down, he digs right in and consumes it almost instantly.<br /><br />There have been no GI upsets with this food - his stools are completely normal.  Traveling with him is easy with this food because it doesn't require refrigeration and no mixing - although I do give him dry food to ""snack on"" at will, he usually eats only a small amount of this and only when he has been very active.<br /><br />He gets two packages a day, one in the morning, one in the evening so a pack of 24 lasts 12 days."
1,I have always loved Silver Shred marmalade.  so grateful I can find it on amazon.  thanks for your great service.  I am able to find products I can't get anywhere else.
1,"Robertson's are famous for their (orange) Golden Shred marmalade but I've always been more of a fan of the lesser-known lemon version, Silver Shred as I prefer the tart, tangy flavor of lemons to the gentler sweetness you get with oranges. This stuff is amazing on toast made with really good bread, and even better in my opinion if the toast has been allowed to cool and then slathered in a really good butter like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00289S3X2"">Beurre d'Isigny</a> or even <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CC1FM8"">Kerrygold</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010EGNGK"">President</a> before spooning on the marmalade. As its name suggests, Silver Shred contains a fair amount of real shredded lemon peel which I know some aren't so fond of, but if you're among the ""not fond"" crowd, it's easy enough to avoid those bits or pick them out and just stick to the mouthwatering lemony jelly. Heavenly stuff!"
0,"Taste is OK for kids, but this should be called ""Halloween Artificially Colored and Flavored Sweet Drink."" No surprise on the Yellow #6, of course...but really, can you call it ""Hot Chocolate"" without even a hint of cocoa in the mix? Not in my book. Rename it and maybe it'll go up to a three-star concoction. Maybe."
0,"Anybody bother to notice that there is no chocolate listed as an ingredient in this hot ""chocolate?"""
0,"didn't nestle's stop using cans like this for their nestle's quick because little kids sometimes accidentally cut their wrists when they put their hand in to scoop the powder? i thought that was why they started making the plastic ones, because i had a childhood friend who's little brother cut himself like that and their family won a big lawsuit."
1,Good and tasty tea to end the day.  Tea is listed by Dr. Oz as part of a healthy dietary way to help lose weight.  It was easy to order and arrived earlier than listed.
1,"I found these in a Whole Foods one day and thought they were fantastic, but they were also quite expensive.  Amazon offers them in bulk packages for a bit less which is nice, though they're still on the costly side.  The great thing about these is that they are baked, not fried.  That means that there is no fat and very few calories, but they are still satisfyingly crunchy, making them a fantastic ""got the munchies"" snack.  These are indeed cut from real apples and every once in a while you'll get a stem or some slices that are just peel, but for the most part the quality is quite good.  My wife didn't seem to like them, though I'm not sure why - I think they're yummy.  :)  I'd certainly recommend them to anyone who can afford a somewhat pricey, but extremely healthy, snack.  However I'd also suggest trying to find a small bag to try first at a local grocery (most likely an organic-focused one - I don't think Food Lion carries these) to make sure you like them before buying this much."
1,"*****<br />These apple chips are tart, very crispy, and yummy! They don't have the processed or chemically taste that some dried apples have. They also are not soggy at all--I like my apple chips very crispy! They are 100% certified organic, baked with no added sugar, no preservatives or chemicals, no pesticides or herbicides, gluten free, and made from Washington State apples with five apples in every bag. These are a truly healthy and delicious snack.<br /><br />These particular chips are only just barely sweet, mostly tart. If you want sweet apple chips, you can buy Fuji apple chips from the same company that are just as crisp and good. I like to mix both together for a sweet-tart combo.<br /><br />I would also recommend buying these chips in smaller bags (the 2.6 ounce size) unless quite a few people are going to be eating these rather quickly. The reason is that exposure to moisture can render these crispy chips too soft. I like buying them in the smaller bags and then repackaging them in a resealable plastic bag to get rid of all of the extra air. Then I take out only what I plan to eat and quickly reseal the bag. My chips are always crispy this way.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"
1,"At first I doubted that these were going to be JUST APPLES. But they are! no sugars added which is great, because apple chips are amazing on their own! Forgo the hassle of making them on your own every once and a while and order a few from Bare Fruit. I don't think you will be disappointed. The granny smith apples are true to the fresh apple flavor. Great snack alone or maybe dipped in a little homemade peanut butter spread.<br />ENJOY!"
1,"This snack is delicious and healthy.  It's my daughter's favorite so I send them to her at college, a box of twelve smaller bags so that she can take them with her anywhere."
1,"These are just wonderful! They're crunchy, some chewy, tasty, healthy. Will definitely buy again. I like them much better than the cinnamon ones."
1,"Love these dried apple snacks- no added sugar. As expected, the Granny Smith's are a bit tart but not as crunchy as the Fiji apples. Like the resealable bag too! Much better price ordering in this bulk size- they do not last long since they are so tasty!"
1,"This is the perfect good for you snack anytime, anywhere.  The apple chips are always crispy and if you let them sit on your tongue to rehydrate it is like having of fresh slice of Granny Smith all over again! So glad I found this product and would recommend to everyone!!"
1,"These chips are great!  They have very few calories because they are just apples!  They taste nice and tart.  I signed up for repeat deliveries because they are so good.  The funny thing is that my Boston Terrier loves them too.  He recognizes the sound of the bag and runs over and watches me eat them, and I throw him one every once in a while.  A healthy treat for both of us!"
1,"I've been ordering a lot of the bare fruit baked chips to snack on lately. I find that I prefer the Fuji apples over the Granny Smith, despite the Fuji apple chips coming in an unmarked and nearly unlabeled bag. These are good and a nice replacement for potato chips, though a bit sour. More power to you if that's your thing."
1,"Granny smith version of these apple chips (like the apple) are a little more tart than the regular version of the apple chip. Also, these chips are $5.89 + tax/bag at Costco."
1,"These ""chips"" are so addicting!  I used to buy them at costco but they stopped selling them so I bought them here.  They are nice also cause I don't feel guilty about eating them!  They don't put anything extra on the apples.  They are so much better than the other apple chips you see at the store."
1,"These apples are delicious and work great for the HCG diet as a substitute for regular apples.  This is important when you travel as much as I do because the Dept. of Agriculture allows you to take these back into the country, whereas regular apples are subject to a fine.  The (Bare) apples also provide the crunch that is so satisfying when you are craving a snack.  I wish MY Costco would carry them."
1,"A delicious and healthy snack alternative for those potato chip and crunchy snack lovers.  I prefer the apple,but the pear chips are excellent as well.  Auto shipment is so convenient too."
1,"A++ Simply amazing, crispy, tangy, healthy. I don't feel guilt after eating a whole bag. What more could you ask for? I wish they had a banana version."
1,"These Organic apple chips are great. I really like the crunchy texture, and sometimes there's a chewy one too. A much healthier snack than potato chips. They are a satisfying crunchy snack and offer lots of fiber. These are not as sweet as the Fuji's or the Organic Cinnamon Apple Chips (Red bag), but all are a good."
1,Love that these are organic!  The taste is very good!  Very good value for all that you get!  Will order again!!
1,"These are super expensive in the supermarket. This is the best<br />deal you can get. I used to buy these at costco and they stopped<br />selling them. This is a really good deal, they came fast and taste amazing."
1,"First of all - conventional apples are one of the 'dirty dozen' of produce to avoid, so finding an organic version of dried apples to snack on is wonderful. I first got these at Costco like others here, but I am going to order here now.<br /><br />They are nice alone - but try them with a bit of organic raw cheese, some pistachios or healthy crackers - delicious! The combination of the tangy with the salty /creamy is mouth watering and satisfying.<br /><br />Much preferable if you are having a sweet tooth to do this as opposed to candy or pastry. You do have to watch the quantities because the sugar grams will add up, even though it is natural fruit sugar.<br /><br />I really encourage parents to get these for their kids as a snack, and try them with cheese or something salty."
1,"The Lemon Lotus is a wonderful product. Absolutely delicious, it's like drinking a glass of sweet lemonade with an ever so slight hint of the x50 Blue Lotus extract flavor (which I also love).<br /><br />I like how they switched from the shots to the powder. It dissolves easily when steeped and stirred into hot water (or when funneled into a water bottle and shook). I prefer this for 2 reasons.<br />One, the shots where just that, shots. As a powder I can enjoy a whole glass of it!<br />Two, I can more easily control the dose -- stronger when I'm in a bad mood, or weaker if I just want a nice refreshing drink.<br /><br />As for its effects, I would say overall, it subtly puts me into a calmer, more talkative and generally happier mood.<br /><br />Overall, I really love this product and will definitely buy more as needed. Was shipped and arrived very quickly and Mood & Mind have always been more than happy to answer any questions I have about their products.<br />Highly recommended, 5/5!!!"
1,"I got one of these as a free sample from ordering Kratom from their company, and I absolutely love it. It tasted good, and immediately calmed me down. I will definitely be ordering this, and it works so well, I might consider it as an alternative to my prescribed anxiety medications as it takes effect faster and works about just as well.<br /><br />Thanks MoodAndMind! You guys sell high-quality products that work better than the medications I'm on. I was and still am surprised at how well your products work. I would recommend the site to anyone, and already have recommended the Lotus shots to 4 people after just my one use.<br /><br />Oh, and it tastes great lol. 5/5"
1,"I tried the lemon lotus shot because of some friends who used it and spoke very highly of it.  Took a shot, had some wine, and had a great evening! A smooth, mellow, pleasant feel with no side effects. I enjoyed the shot so much I ended up ordering the lotus powder (20:1) as well. Now I'm a repeat customer. This company has always had super fast delivery and has answered any questions I've had quickly and thoroughly.  Couldn't be happier (and that's not just the lotus talking) :)"
1,This is by far the best blue lotus out there!I dont drink alcohol so I just took a couple shots and it was fantastic!Very mellow!I would recomend this to anyone who needs to chill out!
1,These guys rock! Nice refreshing drink with a little extra kick to help you wind down.I will reorder! Thanks again Mood and Mind!
1,"first off, great customer service. i ordered the blue lotus 50x and kanna and got this as a free sample. hands down, the best tasting herbal drink i have ever had, the stevia is an amazing extra for taste."
1,"In the time since I first discovered blue lotus, I've tried several conventional and a few unconventional methods to to consume it. The first time I got the powder, I just sort of grabbed a handful and dumped it into my mouth. That did not go well.<br /><br />Next I tried dumping a few tablespoons into yogurt and then eating it. That also did not go well.<br /><br />I tried buying the plant itself and burning it, steeping it in hot water, and even tossing it into a salad, but overall, my favorite method was making a tea out of the powder.<br /><br />Or so I thought. I decided to try the mood drink despite my apprehensions, and boy am I glad I did! When I got it, I opted to have two servings at once, since I'm what you might call a tall drink of water (or lemon lotus drink, as the case may be), and after making the drink and seeing how easily it dissolved , I resisted my urge to pinch my nose and down it in one.<br /><br />It tasted GOOD! And I don't mean the sort of ""good"" where you grimace and rasp ""H-hey, this is *cough* kind of good!"", I mean good like a nice glass of lemonade, with a hint of blue lotus. There was no annoying grit (the biggest problem I have when I make tea, but that's my fault) and it had a nice effect that wasn't too overbearing. Yet another highly enjoyable experience from a company that actually cares about the quality of their merchandise.<br /><br />BONUS RECIPE: Lemon Lotus Piledriver<br /><br />Ingredients<br /><br />1-4 servings of Lemon Lotus Mood Drink<br />1 bottle of Perrier or something similar<br />1-4 tablespoons of lemon juice<br />Vodka (Citrus works well, but plain is fine too)<br />2 pinches of lemon salt<br />Ice<br /><br />Directions:<br />Mix lemon lotus powder with room temp vodka, mix until drink powder is thoroughly dissolved.<br />Add in Perrier and lemon juice, put into shaker with ice and shake vigorously.<br />Pour into highball glass, garnish with lemon wedges or lotus ice cubes and serve.<br /><br />PS: Check out my blog for more recipes and such!

1,"I have tried this product many times as it really, really helps relax and it helps with sleep. An FYI, it mixes really well with your favorite liqueur. I feel it mixes well with either Whiskey, like a whiskey sour, or with vodka. You need to try this! And beyond that, this Company has the best customer service I have encountered with any mail order Company. They really, really care!"
1,I've obtained a sample of this with an order from Kratom.  It really enhanced the euphoric effects of Kratom causing me to order more immediately.  I highly recommend this product!
0,"I'm not sure if the four I purchased were from a bad batch or what, but the product had no effect on me whatsoever. I have tried the blue lotus 50:1 tablets and was very satisfied. I thought a liquid blue lotus would be absorbed better by the body, thus a better effect. It was quite the opposite. You live and you learn I guess, but I wouldnt try this product again unless it was free."
1,"I was very surprised how well the lemon lotus worked. I was using mood & minds Kratom (great stuff!) and I asked about the lemon lotus liquid shot, & the lotus powder. mood & mind sent me samples, and I was very surprised. This stuff is great and I would highly recommend both types. Great products, great people. Mood & mind are professional, and very honest good people. Thank you...."
1,"Great stuff delivery is very fast . I mix it with gin and tonic  the effect feel relexing and chiil nothing crazy but life seems less troubling , I tried it with kratom they seem to mix well"
1,"This stuff rocks!nice mellow buzz when its added to some booze:)I had a gin and tonic with one and it was fantastic!I will continue to buy this stuff for sure!And its 50:1 now so thats more than double the potency!It was 20:1.If you would like an extra kick in your drink,get some of these!TRUST ME!"
1,"50:1 lemon lotus 4 pack shots (first time user) Item was mind altering but not as powerfull as expected, started with one shot early in the day and recieved mild effects felt sort of like an alcohol buzz, later in the day i had another shot and had the same effects as b4 drank a can of beer and another shot trying to get more out of the lotus within the hour i did not feel much of a change,had a 3rd shot and no change 45 minutes later i was sober. problem could be because i didnt use right, was left wondering if maby you can only get so much effect out of product similar to kratom (you can only get so high with kratom after that you get sick and misureable) then thought maby i was suposed to take all 4 shots at once for the great feeling and phychoactive or hipnotic effect who knows it was fun anyway. After i do more research on using lotus i will most likely buy this product again and give it another run.<br />  Please do not let my story discourage you from buying and trying this product. my intent was to get the message across if you dont know how to use this product learn about it first then try it out, that way the seller doesnt get blamed for your poor results"
0,"This product is a complete waste of time and money.  Me and a friend tried it with a bottle of wine and it had absolutely no noticeable effects whatsoever on either one of us.  We did feel a little more sleepy than normal after taking it.  But other than that, this product did absolutely nothing to either one of us.  After my experience with this product, I am convinced the other reviews are either shill reviews or from inexperienced users who merely received a placebo effect from this product."
1,"My kids (18 mo and 3 yrs) love the HappyBaby Tots.  We have tried every flavor and they eat all of them.  I love that they are getting good, organic nutrition, and that the ingredients are wholesome.  They are very convenient to throw in your diaper bag or purse on-the-go, or to stick in a lunch box for a snack.  We use a spoon and sometimes a bowl at home for self feeding with my little one, but you can also give the pouch to them to eat directly from the squeeze pouch.  Thank you, HappyBaby, for such great products!!"
1,"My kids (18 mo and 3 yrs) love the HappyBaby Tots.  We have tried every flavor and they eat all of them.  This is one of my favorite flavors, because how often do kids get beets otherwise?

They are very convenient to throw in your diaper bag or purse on-the-go, or to stick in a lunch box for a snack.  We use a spoon and sometimes a bowl at home for self feeding with my little one, but you can also give the pouch to them to eat directly from the squeeze pouch.  Thank you, HappyBaby, for such great products!!"
1,this is so easy on the go!  I typically make my own food for my little one but this makes it so easy when we are out running errands!  my baby loves it!
1,"My daughter, who is in preschool, loves these Happy Baby organic pouches-her tops flavor are the apple-cherry, pear, mango, banana kiwi.  They are perfect chilled and very nutrient dense.  Easy to throw in bag as the package is soft and BPA free."
1,"My 8 month old son loves these. I keep one in my purse at all times. He is breastfeed and we make his other solid foods (cook, puree and freeze)--but this is what I use when we're out so that I don't have to worry about microwaving or his fresh food going bad from being out too long. He really likes this flavor and I'm happy because it includes three foods that I haven't been making for him. I'm trying to introduce him to all the fruits and vegetables that are OK for him to eat at this age, and I'm hoping that eating the spinach in this will make him less likely to reject it later... Only downside that I can think of is that these are rather watery. Not sure if that is solved if you move to the Stage 3 ones."
1,"My 10-month-old LOVES these and my 3 yr old even sneaks bites from them! They both think they are really tasty, and I feel good feeding them an organic product. I would DEFINITELY buy these again."
1,"My 8 month old isn't quite capable of sucking the food out of those things yet, but if I squeeze it out into a bowl and spoonfeed her, she LOVES them! Mommy thinks they're rather tasty too ;) I felt like it was great value for our money, as we will be using these on vacation to lighten our loads (versus glass jars) but they're not cheap enough to buy for everyday use. I normally make my own baby food."
1,"If you want/need convenience, this item is fabulous!  We always rate the organic baby food pouches high and our only concern is the price.  We find the pouches great for taking to restaurants, in the car, on picnics, to the zoo, etc.  Also, it continues to be an easy way to get super foods into our toddlers without the preparation of the fruits and vegetables!  We still keep them on hand even after the baby food days are gone."
1,"This is a fine product.  My daughter eats it right up and seems to enjoy it.  I will say however that it is very liquidy (no texture) so I have more drips when feeding her.  I wish it were a bit more solid in texture (I really like Plum Baby Food due to the texture).  Again, daughter loves it."
1,"I love this baby food for my baby and I like that it is as affordable as the Gerber, preservative laden non-organic baby food when purchased on subscribe and save through Amazon. It tastes fresh and good and I like how the packaging is created to be convenient on the go. I always have these packets of food in my purse with the little screw on spoons in case my little one gets hungry while we're out."
1,"I got my son used to these a a young age, and if it weren't for them, I'm not so sure he'd get as many veggies as he does.  Somedays he will have some veggies, and he eats fruits with no problem, but I'm always looking for snacks that incorporate veggies and these are great, especially before a meal as a late snack, or after lunch as an afternoon snack."
1,"My 9 month old started eating this flavor at about 7 months old and loves it!  She isn't really a picky eater, but she likes some things more than others.  When its time for the spinach/mango/pear she takes one tastes then asks for more!  I've tasted it, its pretty good.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the consistency is a bit watery and difficult to keep on the spoon when feeding the baby.  I'd love it if they just didn't puree it quite as much or didn't add quite so much water, then it would be perfect."
1,he loves the flavor..i tried one from the market to make sure he likes it.i get it on amazon now..its good price and alwasy have them on the go...they are great
0,"My son loves the purees in the pouches, except this one is way too tart.  He took one sip, made a funny face and handed it back to me!"
1,Anyone who has a child that refuses veggies should try this! It's a great combo of fruit and veggies- and so easy to feed to older babies- my daughter feeds herself and NO mess! It's great for on the go. Love them!
1,"This actually tastes really good.  All my kids (ages 6,5 and 22 months) love these.  I just throw one in my bag and give to the baby.  No need to carry a spoon.  It's a healthy little snack for all."
1,"This flavor is great, I love the fact it has veggies and fruit together. I gave this flavor to my 6 month old baby and he loved it. If you have problem with this blend being to runny I solved it by using Boon spoon or Plum organics boon spoons for pouches which made it breeze to feed the baby.<br />My son loves all the other flavors he tried as well ( pear; pear & peas & broccoli; apples & cherry; banana & blueberries & beats ), he did not like sweet potato & apricot flavor, it was too tart and sour for him, but I contacted Happy Baby customer service and the next batch should have more sweet potato to help with the sour taste, but if you can buy just one pack and try it you might have a baby that likes it either way.<br />Most of all I love the packaging, it is perfect since we travel a lot and it is so much lighter then glass jars and easier to pack as well."
1,"We tried this flavor when my son was almost 6 months and he wouldn't eat it. It is too sour even for me. I have talked to customer service and they had complains from other people and the next batch will have more sweet potato in so it should taste better. I will give it try again when the new batch is out. Otherwise my son loved all the other flavors we tried so far ( pear, mango&spinach&pear, Pear&peas&broccoli, apple&cherry, banana&beat&blueberries ). So try one before ordering bunch on Amazon.<br />The pouch idea is great, so easy to travel with! Some of the flavors are little runny but I am using Boon spoon and it works great. I am also going to try out the Plum organic Boon spoon for pouches, should fit Happy baby pouches as well."
1,"I start giving these flavor to my son when he was 5,5 months and he loves it. Great mix of veggies and fruit that isn't too sweet. The pouches are great, we travel a lot and spend lot of time in our second home in Costa Rica and these are very easy and much lighter then glass jars to bring with us.<br />My so likes all the flavors he tried so far ( pear, mango&spinach&pear, apple&cherry, banana&beat&blueberry ) he didn't like apricot&sweet potato it was too sour for him, but I heard that the next one should have more sweet potato so it should not be as sour anymore.... have to wait to see when the new batch is out."
1,"This is another one of my daughter's favorite snacks.  She seems to prefer the varieties with pears in them, and I do like that is is getting some spinach and that she actually likes it!  She does prefer the Peas, Broccoli, & Pear flavor, but this is also a favorite.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the smell of the mango can be pretty overpowering.  I like fresh mango, but for some reason the smell of mango baby food is just awful to me!  Other than that, a good product that I'll be ordering again."
0,"I've tried a few of these fruit and veggie squeeze packs (for my toddler primarily) in a few different brands.  This is the only flavor she didn't like.  She did try it, but gave it back to me after one bite.  Later, I tried to feed it to my baby with her oatmeal, and she didn't like it either!  I am a little surprised, since sweet potatoes are her favorite.  Maybe if your kids like apricot they will like this flavor, but mine didn't.  We'll be sticking with the Pears, Peas, & Broccoli flavor."
1,"I originally bought this after my toddler had tried some squeeze pack apple sauce and enjoyed the novelty of it.  She likes applesauce anyway, but I thought I might be able to get her to eat some veggies if I could find them in a squeeze pouch too.  This fruit and veggie mix is perfect -- she gets some green veggies, but it really does taste just like pears!  I've tried several flavors, and this is her favorite by far.  My baby is starting solids now and she likes this one too."
1,"As far as flavor, our boys really like these!  We like to keep organic pouches on hand for things like restaurants, traveling, and quick healthy snacks while preparing their meals.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the price, but like anything, you pay for convenience.  We have gotten good deals on Amazon though, just wait for a good price then stock up!"
1,My six month old cannot get enough of this food. He prefers it over the other pouch items by far!!!  I love the mix of veggies and fruits.  So easy to travel with as well.
1,These are the best! They may be a little more expensive then regular applesauce in a cup but it is so worth it when your kids (any age) suck them down one after another and you have NO mess to clean up. They don't even know they are healthly!
1,"My husband said this Happy Baby flavor is really good.  I love the mixture of fruit and veggie.  If you haven't tried this company before, you are in for a real treat.  The food is delicious, and it is never too sweet or fake tasting."
1,"Another great flavor from Happy Baby.  The first one I got, I shared with my daughter because it is so tasty.  It is a nice cherry flavor, not fake or too sweet.  These pouches are great for babies who can use straws."
0,"My 5.5 yr old son LOVES apricots and sweet potatoes so I was excited to try this flavor. I tried a sample package sold at Target and it tasted pretty good so I ordered a bunch online. He took one taste of this batch and handed it right back to me. I tasted it and whoa- it is SUUUUUPER SOUR - much more so than the one I tried at the store!?!? It gave me goosebumps! Wha???? I now wonder if they changed the recipe, started using unripe apricots or I mistakenly bought the wrong brand of this combo??? I'll have to try mixing it with some applesauce in a GU bottle or try to add it to my baked sweet potatoe/apple dish so it's not a total waste of money. Beware of this flavor!"
1,"My daughter loves this flavor and the pouch makes it so easy to use on the go.  She doesn't need a spoon, just drinks it from the pouch. Thank you Happybaby!"
1,My son loves these.  They're very tasty (yes I tried it) and I love that they're organic and have some veggies as well as fruit in the easy to use smoothie!
1,"This food is tart, I was surprised.  I guess it is good because so much baby food is so sweet.  My daughter still likes it, though.  I wish Happy Baby had more food in these kinds of packets, as she can eat them right out of the container by herself at 10 months."
0,"I bought this for my 15 month old son who has become a VERY picky eater.  I wanted a fun and easy way to make sure he gets his fruit and vegetable servings each day.  This does NOT do the trick!  He took one suck, made a horrible face, and has refused it since.  I tried it thinking it couldn't be THAT bad.  It was.  Terribly bitter (just the thought makes my mouth water) and runny.  No wonder he wouldn't eat it.  I wouldn't either!  I did buy some of the other varieties offered by HappyBaby and he loves them.  I think this is just a bad taste combo.  Yuck!"
1,"This is probably my toddler's favorite pouch.  I have to admit, there's a lot of lemon juice in this mix, which makes the pouch somewhat sour.  My toddler loves lemons though so this is just exactly his taste.  If you're unsure whether your baby likes sour, don't buy this in bulk - it's probably for an acquired taste! :)"
1,This is such a great product.  My son loves it and I just put it in the diaper bag when we are in a rush to leave the house and have a healthy snack for the way.  I tasted it and thought it was good.  great help for moms on the move.
1,"My children love the happy baby organics. I just wish they had more of a selection on Amazon. I have tried the food, as I try everything before giving it to my kids, and they taste great. I highly recommend it to any mom that wants their children to eat organic. It is easy to use, easy to travel with, and healthy for them!"
1,"My one year old can actually ""drink"" these right from the package, using the spout like a straw, which makes these a super convenient option to have for snacks when we're out and about--no bib or spoon needed. He has food allergies, so finding processed foods that meet his needs and are still healthy and conveninent can be tough. He has loved all of the Happy Baby products we've tried. The multi-packs are a great deal and it is nice to be able to stock up this way instead of just buying singles from the only store around here that carries them."
1,"I found these at Target a few months back and decided to give them a try for my dairy/soy allergic one year old son. It is tough finding on-the-go food options for him that meet with his dietary needs and satisfy my pickiness for healthy kids food. The deals for the multi-packs are great. My little one is old enough now that with a bit of help, he can just suck the food straight from the ""spout"" of the package like a straw and he LOVES them. He gets so excited when he sees me pull one out and they are so easy to throw in a purse or diaper bag so that I always have a good snack for him with me, no bib or utensils needed."
1,"My 15 month-old twin boys aren't big fans of spinach, but they LOVE these pouches. This is a great combination with the mangos and pears and you can still taste the spinach. Anytime my boys need a quick snack, I whip out one of these pouches and can be assured they are getting their fiber, vitamins, and nutrients.  Also try the Beets, Blueberries, and Banana combo!!!<br /><br />These pouches are especially helpful during teething time or when your babies get to the 'picky eater' stage. For the teethers, it's been helpful for us to place a few pouches in the fridge. For the picky eaters, we administer a swig of this inbetween bites and we can cram in a few more bites. These pouches are much better than giving pure juice and aren't messy. If you do give them the pouches to eat on their own, just be wary that they may squeeze too hard and up comes all of the food. The screw on top helps if they don't finish it all. Just place it into the fridge for the next day or later and if you're out, pace it back into your diaper bag with a cold pack. No yucky jar top taste, no spoons to mess around with, and the combinations are tasty.  Just make sure your little one doesn't place the tops in their mouths.  Mine have done that a couple of times but with all the advantages of these pouches, I can keep an eye on the top a bit more.<br /><br />With the subscribe and save through Amazon, it's so much more cost saving than purchasing these in the stores."
1,"Beets!!!  How many of you out there have babies/toddlers/kids who eat beets?  Well, mine aren't big fans but they LOVE these pouches.  This is a great combination with the blueberries and bananas and you can still taste the beets.  Anytime my 15 month-old twin boys need a quick snack, I whip out one of these pouches and can be assured they are getting their antioxidants and nutrients.<br /><br />It's especially helpful during teething time or when your babies get to the 'picky eater' stage.

1,"My toddler LOVES these!!!  She begs for them the moment we get into the car when I pick her up from preschool.  The only hard this is that she can't open the cap by herself (which I don't mind, or else, she's ""break into them"").  The cap is also resealable, which is nice in case.  I highly recommend these. I used to buy Ella's Kitchen Organic Smoothies and baby food pouches, but they are WAY more expensive!  The taste is just as great!  Buy these!"
1,"The last couple of days, my son has been more of a fussy eater.  We even gave him pizza and he had a few bites and was frustrated by bite 5 or 6.  These had just come in the mail and I cracked one open.  He HOUSED the whole pack! That's a lot to be said for a child who eats a couple ounces at a time!  If I need a failsafe food, this flavor combination has done it!  5 Stars ALL THE WAY!"
0,"My daughter seemed to really enjoy the taste, but it made a huge mess because it was so watery.  I won't buy it again."
1,"We love this stuff, and so does our son.  Right out of the package like astronaut food.  Tasty and tidy!"
1,Very good. My daughter loves these and it is a great source of vitamins and fiber! Taste them they are good!!
1,"I started using HAPPYBABY foods when my son was about nine months old.  At that time I was only aware of their frozen line.  I was SO EXCITED to hear about their pouches.  Although my son is now eating solids, I purchased some of the Stage 2 and 3 to use as snacks/fillers for other meals.  I loved the food combinations in the pouches.  An added plus, all the pouch packaging is BPA and pthlate free.<br /><br />My son loves the pouches.  I put the Stage 3 meat combos over pasta with a little cheese sprinkled on top for a nutritious, great tasting meal for my son (or the whole family).  He thinks he's getting a special treat.<br /><br />I highly, highly recommend HAPPYBABY products.  You won't be disappointed."
1,"These things are awesome. My 2 year old will not eat veggies, but he LOVES these. I feel much better knowing I can get some kind of veggies in him!"
1,"My little eater isn't picky, but the spinach, mango and pear is his favorite food of all.  The food is tasty, although it's a little bit expensive at Amazon.  The grocery store and the big boxes tend to have this one a little bit cheaper.  Thankfully, Happy foods are becoming increasingly easy to find.  Good products and tasty foods = well, Happy Baby!"
1,"My 11 mo old son was a great eater until one day he decided nothing tasted good anymore. After a long 5 days of begging, dancing, singing, giving him my cell phone... I tried these packets. He LOVES it!! Great purchase. Expensive but totally worth it to get through those tough days. Also, great for travel and plane rides!"
1,My son is 4.5 months old and LOVES all of the happy baby organic baby food pouches.  The convenient boon spoons do fit on the end of these packages.  They taste great and are an awesome deal!
1,"My son loves his Happy Baby pouches, and I like to share them--they're like all organic smoothies!  Banana, beet, blueberry is a great flavor combination, too."
0,"This product tries to skirt the fact that the pouches are NOT recyclable, and the caps are a choking hazard. It doesn't make a lot of sense....buy an organic food product that puts more trash in the landfill. They toss around the buzz phrase ""BPA free"", but it is still more plastic going into the landfill. And, they use another buzz phrase, ""lower carbon footprint than glass jars"". Huh? Glass may have a higher carbon footprint, but it can be (and is) recycled over & over into food containers. Plastic cannot be recycled into new food containers. Yes the caps are recyclable, but recycled plastic often has no market for reuse. And, make sure your child doesn't try to eat them first."
0,"I really dislike that Companies are combing Fruit & Vegetables. No wonder kids are not liking Vegetables. I would like to purchase pre-packaged Baby Food, but after Stage 1 all I can seem to find are products with Vegetables and Fruit mixed so the food tastes sweet. I guess I have to stick with making my own baby food. Oh and the packaging is so convenient that you can even forego the Spoon and Dish, what does this teach your Children!"
0,"My 2 year old daughter loves these sort of squeeze pouches so I ordered a whole case of these thinking that I could sneak some veggies in. Unfortunately this is not the case. These are so sour that she shudders after taking a sip!  So just says ""don't like it!"" and wants the plain mango one. Curious, I tried it and although it has a very sweet taste in the beginning the after taste of sour beets is awful!  Be prepared, if your little ones aren't a fan of beets, they may not be a fan of this flavor!"
0,"I was hopefully that since this was a mixed food combo it would be thicker in consistency - WRONG! It was like straight water. It made such a messy. I used it with my 6 month old who has recently started solids, but this was a disaster. He did seem to like the flavor, that's why I gave it 2 stars. I am going to keep it so that when he older I can mix it with some oatmeal for breakfast."
0,"I was hoping to ""sneak"" beets into my sons snack, but there is no hiding with this brand. In fact, the beet flavor is rather overwhelming, and rather on the ""raw"" side. I enjoy beets, pickled and roasted, but this flavor is just not appealing at all. If your kid loves beets (maybe even raw ones?) go for it.  Also, someone commented on it being a runny consistency but my recently ordered batch is on the thick side."
1,"My youngest loves this flavor straight out of the pounch and my older kids enjoy it without even knowing.<br /><br />My youngest often takes this in her lunchbox to preschool to enjoy during the day since she can recap it as many times as she would like.<br /><br />For my older kids, this is my favorite product to hide in all of their ""treats""!  The apple & cherry flavoring is delicious in smooties, brownies, cupcakes and makes everything healthier."
1,He will scream at us to have these and he is now 18 months. We will give this to him for one of his serving of vegetables because sometimes it's hard to get him to eat them otherwise.
0,"The price from 911drugstore is crazy!  If you buy the spinach, mango and pear one, which amazon itself sells, it is half the price (see link) of 911drugstore and about twice what you'd pay retail.  Don't buy from this company. They are price gouging.<br /><br />That said, all of this band of baby food that I've tried are great.  I don't even use a spoon, my son likes to just suck it right out of the tube and has been since he was 7months old.  Great for road trips or just being on the go<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030VJ8PE"">HAPPYBABY Organic Baby Food, Stage 2, Spinach, Mango & Pear, 3.5 Ounce Pouch (Pack of 16)</a>"
1,"Our son is 6 months old. This was his first mix of foods after he's had his first foods an ingredient at a time...You should see how he opens his mouth big like he's about to swallow me whole every single time I bring one of these to him and am about to open it. It is so convenient, too...because when we are out at the park or after a doctor's appointment and he's hungry, I can just take one of these out of the diaper bag and squeeze it into the spoon for him to eat it. Also, when he only has half of it, we put the rest in the fridge and then in the evening we heat it up in a bowl of hot water. It's also great that we never actually touch the food w/ the spoon, so no bacteria goes into the pouch...We love it...We really have no negatives about it...I'm about to order a new batch now as we're vising some friends in TX next week and we need to grab food for the plane and also for the trip. These are great because they're not as heavy as the jars."
1,"Great product, but I pay 75 cents per pouch at our local grocery store.  Here they are selling for over 2 dollars a pouch.  I was hoping to put a few cases on monthly shipment but given the price I will keep buying them at the grocery store!"
0,"I feel mislead by the name of this product as the ingredient list on the package lists pears first then peas and then broccoli. When I tasted it myself I realized why my daughter was enjoying it so much, it just tasted like sweet pears. If a product is going to claim to be healthy and organic it should know it's customers are not afraid to give their kids vegetables."
1,"I have bought Happybaby products in the past and love them all!! I was so bummed when their other pouches went off the market! So glad they are back! I love that they have some with veggies in with the fruit, they are the only kind i buy. I have them everywhere!! My son loves them and so do I! They are great for vacation when you can't control meals quite as much as home i know he is still getting some better foods in his diet. My son is now 2 and i don't see an end to him enjoying these! I would like some more flavors with veggies in them!"
0,"I was happy to see the list of ingredients here listing the peas and broccoli before the pears, thinking that as in package ingredients the larger ingredients are listed first. But after ordering I see on the package ingredient list that, yes, pears are the majority of the ingredients. Common but misleading the way this prodcut description was written."
1,"We were a bit apprehensive about purchasing this banana, beet and blueberry flavor after reading several reviews that it was sour and their children did not like the taste.  However, our 8-month old daughter loved this flavor and in fact, hasn't opened her mouth as widely for any of the other Happy Baby flavors as she did with this one.  The consistency looks like a berry smoothie and it smelled great.  So I tasted it and it does have a bit of a tart taste, but it's very slight to me.  I almost wanted to finish it because it had just enough sweetness to go with the slightly tart taste.  It's too bad this isn't made in the 4.2oz package because our daughter usually wants just a bit more than what comes in this package.<br /><br />It is a bit more expensive than some other organic brands, but well worth the price.  In our opinion, the flavors taste so much more natural and fresh and taste great to us as adults rather than having that ""baby food"" type of taste that many brands have.<br /><br />Also, there is a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L4BV5U"">Plum Organics Dispensing Boon Spoon, 2-Count Packages (Pack of 4)</a> that can screw onto this packaging as well as the Plum Organics packages of food.  It comes with a carrying case for the spoon tips.  This makes feeding time so much easier when you screw the spoon onto the package and then can easily throw away the package and put the spoon tip back in the case rather than having to bring a separate spoon and container to squeeze the food into so you can feed your baby."
0,"My boy is not a picky eater. He likes these pouched food except this flavor: it is too sour, even I have a problem with it! He is eager to try, sometimes he even takes it out of the food storage box and asks me to open for him, but after one sip or two, he gives up. Now I am stuck with a box of these, not knowing what to do with it. I'd like to give them away, but if my son doesn't like them, how can I know if other babies will eat it? I will not buy them again. My mistake was that I didn't read all the reviews on this item :(. A hard lesson learned!"
1,"This is the easiest and fastest way to get my son to eat his fruits and veggies.  He is 1 and can feed this to himself...great for on the go, in the car, etc.  He sucks it right down, no mess and eco friendly :)"
1,"We love these. They are absolutely delicious and the handy pouch is convenient for sipping on the go. A previous reviewer indicated the puree is a bit thin for a spoon and I agree with that. However, it doesn't bother me because if your diaper bag space is at a premium, like mine, you can forget the spoon and just sip from the pouch. My 7 month old has no problem doing this."
1,Our 10 month old baby loves this one. It's her are all time favorite food.  These pouches are great for meals on the go as well.
1,"These things are awesome. My 2 year old will not eat veggies, but he LOVES these. I feel much better knowing I can get some kind of veggies in him!"
1,We have tried almost all of the Happy Baby flavors and I can honestly say that this one is my daughter's favorite flavor of this brand. I only wish that the package was slightly larger as she is able to finish it in a few moments and sometimes wants a second!
1,"My one-year-old loves these!  I like the mixture of fruit and veggie, and they are so convenient.  I haven't tasted them, but my daughter eats them so fast and gets excited just when she sees it.  So I'm assuming they are delicious!"
1,My son has been eating these as a snack for almost a year now. It's a great on-the-go healthy food option that also helps with hydration. My son loves them!!
0,"We generally make food for our little one at home, but I wanted to try a couple pouches because they seem like a good option for throwing into the diaper bag.  I chose the Happy Baby Broccoli, Peas and Pear because of the great reviews from other parents.  It's true, our baby opens his mouth WIDE for this stuff.  He is a fairly good eater of whatever we give him, but I don't think I've seen him this excited to eat since he first started on solids.  The problem is, I tasted a tiny bit of it and it was extremely sweet.  The package doesn't list any additional sugars or sweeteners, but I find it hard to believe that pears can be THAT sweet.  Even if the sugar comes 100% from the pears and is natural, I still think it's too much.  I'll be mixing it in with oatmeal until it's done and after that I will try a couple other brands to see if there is anything less sweet out there.  If not...I'll just have to suck it up and bring homemade food with me everywhere."
1,I was really happy with the fact that my kids loved this food!  Even my older kids like it!  It is a great way to get them to eat veggies!  My daughter likes to eat it right out of the little pouch!  She cannot even wait for me to get it in a bowl!  I love the unique flavors that this company has for their foods and that the foods always taste fresh!  Also very yummy mixed with cream cheese!
1,"My baby started refusing baby food at 9 mos and my 2.5yr old is a picky eater. I started ordering all of the different flavors of the HappyBaby and HappyTot (which has the magic supergrain Salba in them)line through the automatic delivery service (which lowers the price/amazon mom's helps too) and I call them smoothies. My toddler gobbles these up and asks for more! Even the ones that are green bean, peas, pear, and salba. It's like a miracle! My baby eats them too, but not with quite as much enthusiasm. It makes me feel so nice that my kids are getting some good for them stuff and I don't need to break my neck trying to do it. Oh and they are wonderfully anti-messy. I shove a few in my purse when I know we will be out during hungry times."
1,"I am a mom of 3 kids. My youngest is always on the go as we take her older siblings to their sports practices and games. I was so happy to find a non-breakable, organic, BPA free food for her. I keep these in her diaper bag so when she is hungry, she always has a healthy meal. She likes them all but her top two are spinach/mango/pear and sweet potato/apple! I love that they combine fruits, veggies and super grains!"
1,I feed this to her with a little cereal ...or by itself. -Thin consistency but my baby loves the taste.
1,I purchased this item for my 15 month old son who has become a VERY picky eater.  I wanted a fun and easy way to make sure he gets his fruit and veg servings a day.  This does the trick.  He can feed it to himself and he likes it.  What more can I say?

0,"I like the idea of the pouch baby food, but I was hoping that with a baby on the cover and a Stage 2 written on it, that it would be thicker. It was almost like water. It was a disaster. Maybe these are meant for older kids that get the concept of sucking them out of the pouch instead of being spoon fed to infants."
1,"Being an organic, health conscious family, we turned to Happy Baby for our food needs outside of the homemade foods we make.<br /><br />The banana, beet and blueberry flavors are a great combination that provides a well-balance of vitamins and nutrients children at this age need.<br /><br />Not only does my 8 month old literally beg for more with every bite, I can tell that her digestive system takes well to the hearty and top-of-the-line organic ingredients. Happy Baby = Happy Mama!"
1,My son is 16 months old and still loves these as a snack.  This is a good blend of fruit.
1,"I like to use these ""squeezies"" when my family is on the go and especially in the car. They are small enough that I can keep a couple in my purse for backup snacks. This apple & cherry is a great flavor too and they do not sell it in stores."
1,"My 1 year old loves these pouches.  We normally buy this blend (which is my daughter's favorite!), the spinach and the green bean blends.  It is wonderful because our 1 year old can feed herself on the go, it is full of veggies and organic."
1,My baby loves these. & we can bring them anywhere since they're not glass and we don't need anything since he can just suck on it as is. & have to love the fact it's organic.
1,My baby loves these. & we can bring them anywhere since they're not glass and we don't need anything since he can just suck on it as is. & have to love the fact it's organic.
1,These are great for on the go! I keep a couple in the diaper bag in case we get in a bind and need a quick snack!
1,My kids won't eat broccoli or peas but they will eat these. I'm sure this is more like 75% pear with a dash of veggies but it's better than nothing. I'd like to find a packet that has veggies listed before the fruit but I haven't ever seen those yet.
1,My son loves this food combination and eats it without any complaints. The ingredients are simple and the taste is straightforward - no funky baby food smell like the normal food in jars often has. I will buy again and again.
1,"My baby is 10 months old.  She ate this, no problem.  Her older brother (3) who has loved the straight applesauce however was not as easily pleased.  But so far, he hasn't liked anything but the applesauce.  So I'm happy because baby is happy and eating well.  Absolutely LOVE the convenience of these!!!!!  Where were they with my last two kids!"
1,"I would love to only feed my baby homemade baby food, but since that isn't an option, due to time constraints, I love using the HappyBaby brand.At least I know it's healthy!"
1,This is my son's favorite flavor! He gets soo excited when he sees these pouches. They taste like applesauce. Great snack for a hot day. I enjoy them as well- they're not as gritty as some of the other flavors.
1,My daughter is 22 months old and can finish off a pouch in less than 30 seconds.  She just loves these!
1,"My 14 month old loves these pouches and it's a great way of getting broccoli into her diet.  she just started being able to do it herself recently, although it's sometimes messy.  I just wish they were available in the larger size.  3.5 ounces is not a lot for a toddler - she can finish this in a minute and would want more.  She also loves the spinach, mango, and pear happy baby pouches which are bigger."
1,"We get these through the Amazon Subscribe and Save program. They are an excellent natural snack. My son loves them, and Amazon's Subscribe and Save program makes it so easy to keep them stocked in our pantry. Happy Baby does a great job of producing high quality organic baby food at a pretty reasonable price! They are a staple in our house."
1,"I love HappyBaby, HappyFamily products and all the company stands for.  Squeeze packs are great and all the rage, but these kind are USDA organic, BPA free, and have some better flavor combos, content and options then some other leading brands."
1,This is a super popular flavor with my little one. I can put the pouch in my bag and take it with me on the go. My daughter enjoys the independence of holding it herself and drinking it like a smoothie.  I recommend it to all my mom friends.
1,I'm a busy mom with two jobs and a 6 month old. I want to make my own baby food but I really don't even have five extra minutes to do that. HappyBaby pouches are my go to! I started adding Apple Cherry to my daughters cereal because she didn't want to eat the rice cereal plain. Now she gobbles it up! I feel good that she is getting awesome organic fruit in her cereal that doesn't have added sugar or color and it only took me a few seconds to get it prepared for her.
1,"Happy Family Pouches are so convenient, healthy and easy for little ones to use. Like most households, our mornings are super crazy and these are so perfect to use on the go and in the car. Banana Kiwi is one of our favorites. I love that all of the products are Organic and GMO-Free. I also thought that the price was very reasonable and would definitely order this again. Try mixing a bit of it into Happy Family Organic Oatmeal for a new twist on breakfast for the kids. Happy Family is a must have in our house :)"
1,"We're big HappyBaby fans here, and this flavor pouch is one of my favorites for my son, who is now two. I tried to make my own baby food for him when we were first introducing solids, but I had trouble finding all the fresh organic fruits and vegetables during certain times of the year -- and apricot was one of them. I would have never thought to combine apricots and sweet potatoes on my own, but the combination works! I love that it is really nutrient dense and an easy snack for on the go. My son is in the picky-eater phase and these pouches help get the veggies in! I also think this pouch is the reason behind his current love of dried apricots :) Overall, this is a great flavor combination and a super nutritious food for little ones.<br /><br />I don't find that these pouches are runny like other commenters have mentioned, FYI."
1,"I ordered this product when my baby was starting solids and loved that it had the sweet potato and apricot combo.  What a unique blend.  He is now 16 months and it is one of his favorite HappyBaby flavors.  In fact, he just gobbled one up at lunch today.  He is at the age where giving him snacks on the go is difficult.  I don't always have time to do a bib and highchair for snacks.  I can give him this pouch and it keeps him satisfied until lunch or dinner, and I know he is consuming food that is good for his growing body!"
1,"We love the organic food combination that Happy Family develops-the unique combo of broccoli, peas, and pears exposes babies to both fruit and veggies.  The packaging (that is BPA FREE) is perfect for on the go, travel, snacks on airplanes, and every day meals!  So glad to see the products in more stores. So affordable as well."
1,"Never thought that kiwi and banana would work but it does! I love this product, it's convenient and I like the fact that it's organic. I feel good about giving my babies something like this. The taste is better than any other brand's pouches that we've tried. I like mixing it in their cereal. I also LOVE the fact that you can squirt it out into a spoon and not contaminate the rest of the pouch. Great product!"
1,"I love having one of these pouches in my diaper bag. They are so convenient when we are on the go - at a restaurant, in the grocery store or over at a friends house. You don't need a spoon and they don't make a mess. I hardly have to wipe my 11 month old daughter's face when we are done. I am a fan! I also love that I can screw the top back on and stick it in the fridge if she doesn't finish the whole thing. The best part is that my daughter is getting organic fruits and veggies, and she loves it!"
1,I love all of the HappyBaby pouches because of their fresh taste and healthy ingredients. My toddlers love feeding themselves with these. I also mix it in their yogurt and even make smoothies for myself. This is one of my favorite flavors to use because of the health benefits of blueberries and beets (plus my little ones love the taste!) HappyBaby makes it so easy to introduce my kids to a wide variety of fruits and veggies.
1,"This is my daughter's favorite Stage 2 food! This smells great and actually tastes good. Why would I give my daughter something that tasted bad? I always mix her Stage 2 foods with baby cereal (sometimes yogurt). I switch this out with the Stage 2 Spinach, Mango, Pear pouches.<br /><br />Some things you should know about Happy Baby:<br /><br />Organic ingredients<br />BPA-free packaging<br />Many Vegan choices<br />Gluten free snacks<br />Stage 1 and Stage 2 Pouches are Kosher<br />No GMO's<br />Allergy conscious (no soy, gluten, dairy, or added sugar, and processed in a nut free facility)"
1,"My daughter loves this (as well as every other Happy Baby food she has tried)! The only reason I docked a star is because the consistency is thin. I normally mix all of her Stage 2 foods with cereal, so it's not a big deal for us. However, if your baby eats this straight, try one of the various ""squeezie"" spoons on the market. It is too runny to use a traditional spoon.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I changed my rating to five stars. Yes, it's still a bit runny. However, I have found this to actually be a good thing.<br /><br />My daughter is almost seven months old. We were out the other day, and I had a pouch of this food in the diaper bag. I had just gotten her seated for lunch when I realized that I'd forgotten her bowl, spoon, and cereal to mix with the food. I decided to let her try to ""eat"" it directly from the pouch. (We both drink homemade green smoothies a lot. The consistency is similar.) It was great! She was easily able to suck it out of the pouch, with me holding the pouch, making sure that there was always food near the opening. She only spilled a tiny bit onto her bib. It also took less than five minutes for her to eat!<br /><br />I am going to keep a pouch of this food in the diaper bag from now on. It's great that I don't have to worry about carting a bowl, spoon, and container of cereal anymore. However, I will continue to mix it with cereal at home."
1,"These flavors are so subtle (I ate a whole one before I gave to my kids!) but so great to have your tot introduced to such healhty veggies!<br />I've added about half to jarred organic pasta sauce and it gave it a sweet mild taste...all 3 of my kids loved it!<br />I like that if my little one only eats a bit of the pouch, I can put the cap back on and keep in the frig for later in the day or tomorrow.<br />My 2 year old (picky!) will now eat broccoli most times I give it to him and I'm sure it's because he was used to the flavor in the tot!"
1,"My 2 year old loves these tots!  I started feeding these to my son when I would squeeze them in to a bowl and feed with a spoon when he was under a year.  After that, I would give the pouch to him and he would drink it like it had a straw in it.  It wasn't messy at all!<br />The spinach gives it a savory taste while the mango and pear make it a bit sweet~the falvors combined are perfect!<br />It's a great snack to throw into your purse.<br />I also like the it's dairy and gluten free and not processed in a facility that processes nuts1"
1,"I know I can make the same thing at home in my blender. However, my kids won't eat it because it's not in a cool squeeze container like the Happy Baby blends. They are the best! Both my children love them and I am happy to let them grab them off the shelf at anytime. The nutritional value is hard to beat. The quality is excellent."
1,"These little packets are great for toddlers on the go, especially ones who need some convincing in the way of veggies. A great way to get a little extra iron in their bellies."
1,My 18 month old LOVES Happybaby pouches. The straw is so easy to use at home and on the go. As a mom I'm always wanting her to eat healthy and this is the perfect way to make sure that happens. She loves the flavor and always asks for more.
1,"Before trying these pouches, I would attempt to hide veggies in my daughter's baby cereal and fruit puree.  I could put the tiniest bit in her bowl and she would always detect it.  I'm sure she would have survived without veggies, but it still bothered me that she wasn't eating any.  (It's a mom thing I guess!)  I saw these in the store and thought that the combinations of fruits and veggies in these looked ""interesting.""  I picked up a few, not really expecting my little one to like them.  However, she really liked them - a lot.  Maybe it has something to do with the fact that they come in a pouch that she can feed to herself.<br /><br />Not only were these great to give her as an infant, she still enjoys these as a toddler.  These are great to take with on outings - when it's otherwise difficult to give her produce.  She can eat these without making a mess and we don't have to worry about spoilage.  So far, she has liked all of the flavors.  I like the fact that these aren't stored in plastic or in jars with BPA.  I wish that these would have been available years ago.  :)"
1,"Great packets for on the go (even for older kids). They taste good too, and my daughter really likes them. I like that they are organic, and have both fruit and veggies."
1,"My daughter absolutely loves this brand of baby food. It tastes good. It has a little bit of a bite to it because of the cherries, but it is easy for my two year old to hold and squeeze out the food herself. I have recommended this brand and flavor to other moms."
1,These pouches are wonderful to keep in the diaper bag. They do not require refrigeration or heating so it's great for on the go. My son likes to hold the pouch and feed himself (warning: I always put it in his mouth for the initial squeeze or else he will squeeze so hard it flies in the air).  I also use them in the house for those days when he says no to all other foods. He has never turned down one of these pouches. Figure it's more nutritious than eating goldfish crackers for a meal.
1,"I love this food for my baby and especially the packaging.  Great for feeding baby on the go.  It is a bit liquidy, but its good for my baby.  I like to mix with oatmeal for breakfast.  Great price too compared to the grocery store."
1,"It was always a hassle to go to the store and get as many as we needed. now with Amazon Mom I'm able to order them at a discount, and they come at a set time every few months! Besides, my baby loves it!"
1,When he sees us with this he just grunts at us and reaches for it. We put it in his mouth and he typically has it sucked down before we can pull away. You have to control it though or the juice will get all over him when he squeezes it.
1,"The apple-cherry pouches are great snacks for any ages.  The consistency is not watery, but like applesauce consistency.  The cherry flavor is really delicious and I love that it is organic ingredients with vitamin content!  My child loves them for preschool snacks, we squeeze them on our oatmeal and even substitute them for oil in our baking recipes.  They are a quick snack for on the go parents as well!"
1,"I love these little food packs.  I squeeze the puree directly onto a spoon and feed my baby, and that way no dishes get dirty other than the spoon.  He loves these purees, he'll eat any flavor and they seem quite natural and healthy.  As he gets older he can even suck directly out of the pouch, though sometimes he squeezes too hard and makes a little mess if I let him hold it himself.  They are also super portable and conveniently stored."
1,These are so convenient! We keep these in the diaper bag just in case. He loves these as snacks and we love that they are organic. As far as I'm concerned these are a must have.
1,"My 3 year old grandson will not eat anything resembling a vegetable - he and his toddler brother devour these packs - a couple a day sometimes, so we are relieved that he is getting his vegetables plus other great nutritional ""foods"" in his ""veggie juice""."
1,"So I bought a couple of these for my son's birthday party to put in a goody bag for the babies that were attending. The moms went crazy over them. I don't find the consistency to be thin like other reviews have expressed. In fact, I ended up using the left over pouches for my 5 year old daughter's lunches. I used it on her almond butter sandwiches instead of jelly. So I thought the consistency was fine.<br />The taste was obviously delicious as my daughter didn't even notice the difference. Plus organic, no GMO, BPA free...can't really beat that."
1,"I don't know who the genius was that thought spinach would go great with mango and pear but IT WORKS! The flavor is so tasty on these. Great to just pack in the diaper bag. The BOON spoon actually fits these pouches and it screws on just fine! I love that the packaging doesn't contain BPA. Also no GMOs, all organic. Great product."
1,"so, i have tried this ine the beets with bannans and Peter rabbits squash (orange packet) my son (16months) loves these. he can open the pouch himself walk around and self eat, now with him running all day it is hard for him to sit and be still with this at least he can run around and still have something in his tummy. I highly recommend this product and company. no gmos and organic what a mom wants in food that she didnt make. it is thin but makes it easy to eat out of pouch with little to no sucking involved. i even like them, but i try all food before i give it to my son, quite tasty!"
1,"I was so impressed with this product that I felt compelled to write about it. My 14 month old picky eater would not eat ANYTHING but toddler formula and english muffins. I started cooking for him since he was 5 months old and he ate well but something happened when I went back to work and he no longer accepts ""good"" food. However, he happily ate entire pack of HappyBaby Spinach, Mango & Pear and asked for more two days in the row! My husband is a Mr. Mom for now so weight off his shoulders as far as feeding. We ordered other flavors and hoping trend with eating organic veggies and fruits will continue with our picky eater."
1,"I got these for my son and they are so convent to put in the diaper bag or my purse and make a great quick health snack for him, I am always on the lookout for items that make being a mom easier and this is one of those products."

1,"I had been making all our baby food but we took a long cross-country driving trip and I knew there was no way to keep doing that. So, I did some research (i.e asking other parents  and found these. OUr little guys LOVES this food. He immediately ate an entire pouch, and since has eaten alot of it. It tastes like pear, and has lots of fiber."
1,"We first discovered these pouches at our local Target for $1.09.  We had a coupon and thought we'd try them with our 11 month old.  He absolutely loves to eat this flavor straight out of the pouch.  In fact, it appears that he's drinking it.  I try all the food I feed my baby and was pleasantly surprised by this flavor combination.  I love that with subscribe & save, I can get a great deal on these pouches from amazon."
0,"My 8 month old has eaten nearly on the flavors of ellas, happy baby/tot, and sprout meals.  This one is so tart, she shuttered with a sour face and then started to cry- something that NEVER happens.  I tasted it and it is pretty sour (I like sour), perhaps overwhelmingly so for a fresh pallette (not a beat up adult one). I served it along with a savory meal and she was fine with that but I wont be buying it again.  May be good for an adult smoothie where you want some tang."
0,"My son has been gobbling these pouches down since he was just over a year old (he's now 2 1/2).  They are such a fantastic way to get quality foods into picky bodies.<br /><br />However, this is the only combo that he has refused to eat.  I've tried it multiple times, and he continues to leave the pouch full after taking just one sip.  The rest he will slurp down until even the air is out of the package ;)<br /><br />I'd order any of the other combinations if I were you."
1,This food is loved by my triplets.  It is very easy to take with us when we go out on road trips.
1,"I have a one and two year old who just love these pouches. I appreciate the convenience and the fact that it is a nice healthy snack for them, especially when we are on the go. I like ordering the case on Amazon as it is a much better deal and I always have a nice stash."

1,"My son has a very high gag reflex and transitioning to solids has been a task.  However, he also won't have anything to do with homemade baby food anymore.  We found these pouches when buying food for a trip and he was hooked.  I like that the veggies are organic, the pouches produce little garbage, that he can feed himself, but most importantly, that it is keeping the taste of veggies in his diet while we slowly work on chewing veggies."
1,"I take two of these and a few ounces of water.... mix them up in my daughter's straw cups, and VOILA...  a healthy smoothie, that they think is a treat, so shhhh, dont tell them!!!!"
1,"I have two toddlers who are not always willing to eat fresh vegetables. HappyBaby is a great and tasty way for them to get their veggies and fruits. Pouches are portable and easy eat without a mess. Banana, Beet & Blueberry is a hit with my two toddlers."
1,Out of all the Stage 2 foods this one is not runny and very yummy! My little one loves it.
1,"I and my baby really like Happy Baby food products! The distribution company, not Happy Baby, was very late and tried to charge me for shipping when Amazon had it listed as free.  They corrected the pricing though"
1,My son loves this and it is so easy and not messy for me!  You can't go wrong - YUMMY!
1,"My kids (18 mo and 3 yrs) love the HappyBaby Tots.  We have tried every flavor and they eat all of them.  I love that they are getting good, organic nutrition, and that the ingredients are wholesome.  They are very convenient to throw in your diaper bag or purse on-the-go, or to stick in a lunch box for a snack.  We use a spoon and sometimes a bowl at home for self feeding with my little one, but you can also give the pouch to them to eat directly from the squeeze pouch.  Thank you, HappyBaby, for such great products!!"

1,I have a blk lab and a mastiff that went crazy over them. For my big dogs these are an execellent treat for good behaviour. The chicken bars are a quality item for a good price and I plan to purchase them again.
1,"One of the pleasures of a Keurig is that you can serve a friend or a guest a cup of coffee that will please them and their tastes, not just what you brew for yourself everyday.  I happen to enjoy strong, deeply roasted blends (the kind that you usually find at the specialty coffee shops which seem to be all over the place now).  However, not everyone shares my enjoyment of a strong, full-bodied cup of coffee.<br /><br />I have many friends who often say something like ""I love coffee but Starbucks is just too strong for me"".  Enter Donut Blend.  I have purchased many boxes of Coffee People's Donut Shop Coffee and it is a favorite for many of my friends and family.  When Timothy's announced that they were coming out with the ""Original Donut Blend"" I got in line to try it.  Here is my take on it:<br /><br />It is certainly a little lighter than Coffee People's version but the taste is more complex with clean, bright notes of spice and low acidity.  Surprisingly, it reminds me a little of the Peaberry Kona coffee that I brought back from Hawaii.  It is a perfect blend for those who like their coffee black or with just a little cream and still want it to taste like coffee.  If someone drinks several cups a day I think that Timothy's Donut Blend will not overwhelm their taste buds and will still taste fresh cup after cup.  Mind you, I drink Newman's Own Bold Blend on a regular basis and will continue to do so, but if I am having more than two cups (for those ""special"" mornings when nothing seems to go right) or if I am having a cup later in the day I will drink this one.<br /><br />Just rating it on what I want in a coffee I give it four stars, but judging it for what it is (and not just what I like), it fully delivers and deserves five stars.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK"">Coffee People Medium Extra Bold, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]"
1,"When my wife and I had to make a selection from more than 100 varieties of<br />K-Cups available for our new Keurig brewer, we made a rating sheet copied<br />from the Keurig listing of all the brands and types.  We marked a rating<br />of one to five points for each cup we drank for several months. A rating<br />of one point meant ""Perfect, couldn't be better"", and five points<br />indicated ""Don't like this one"".  We rated one to nine cups of each of 30<br />coffees evaluated.  Timothy's Extra Bold Parisian Nights came out on top<br />with the most number one ratings.<br /><br />We found that our preference was for the Extra Bold Roasts.  We do not<br />prefer the weaker strengths.  The Parisian Nights has great flavor and<br />aroma with no bitterness.  This is a great cup of coffee.<br /><br />We're now on our sixth Subscribe and Save shipment of 4 boxes every two<br />months which proves our satisfaction with this coffee."
1,"I'm a chocoholic and have tried every mocha, swiss almond chocolate, etc. coffee I've ever seen, k-cup and not k-cup.  This is the best.  It may actually be better than German chocolate cake--it's like a no-cal, fat-free dessert.  My favorite way to drink it right now is to throw in a packet of Splenda and a little bit of Organic Valley chocolate soy milk, though it's good without sweetener or creamer.  It's chocolaty, with a hint of coconut.  I highly recommend for anyone who likes coffee (it's not a weak coffee, like most of the flavored kcups I've tried).  Also, Amazon's price for Timothy's is the best I can find, subscribe and save price comes out to around $0.37 a cup.  Enjoy!!"
1,"Timothy's Colombian Decaffeinated is a good tasting coffee for a good price.  The savings are even better if you sign up for the auto renew program.  Also, we have found that you can use each cup twice.  Therefore it's like getting twice the quantity for the money.  I checked with the Keurig company and they said by processing the cups for two cups of coffee or tea will not hurt the machine.<br /><br />  Best, Al"
1,"I bought a Keurig coffee maker for Christmas this year. We all enjoy different coffees in our household and making a pot of any type coffee is a waste. My husband is an espresso drinker, so I purchased Timothy's World Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso coffee to be made with the small setting on the coffee maker which uses 5.25 oz water. This makes it stronger, and he really has enjoyed this coffee. I really recommend this to anyone who enjoys a bold espresso coffee. He was born and raised in Italy and has purchased his coffee grounds from Italy for years to make an authentic cup of espresso. He is fussy about his espresso, so if he likes this one, it must be good."
1,"Thanks to our purchase of a Keurig, I am a converted coffee drinker. Timothy's German Chocolate Cake is my absolute favorite. A delectable blend of warm caramel and coconut gives this coffee a deliciously sweet note while retaining a medium-bodied blend. It isn't too sugary - it's just right! In fact, my hubby and his coworkers all claim this as their number one flavored coffee too. It is scrumptious."
1,I currently use Coffee People's version of Donut Shop and when I saw Timothy's version I wanted to give it a try. This is not as full body as Coffee People's version but I really like the smooth low acidity taste. If you don't want a bold rich flavor I think you will love this smooth great tasting coffee as much as I do.
1,"I purchased this item after reading through the reviews on Amazon.  I have to say that I haven't been disappointed. The cups contain a blend of arabica and kona coffee.  They brew with a nice aroma and color.  I would describe them as a medium roast with a medium strength.  Depending on your mood you can adjust the strength by adjusting the cup size and changing your creamer.  I've had success using whole milk, half and half, and light cream, with light cream being the best in my opinion.  The taste is mellow and very smooth.  I have read other reviews here that have described them as weak or tasteless.  This is simply not the case.  I would compare it to the coffee from Dunkin Donuts.  If you prefer your coffee extra bold, dark roasted, or strong (Starbucks) then you are just not going to be happy with these.  Also, if you prefer to ""double brew"" your cups to get the most for your money, you will be very disappointed.  These will brew a delicious cup of coffee, but only if you use them as directed.  Finally I have to say that Amazon is the best place to buy these.  They have the best prices and fast shipping.  Add this to your subscribe and save to get 15% extra off."
1,"For those who like a bit more flavor than the soft breakfast blends -- this is the best of the bunch.  I have worked through most brand ""bolds"" and come back to this one every time.  Black Tiger is similar but does not have some of the added flavor notes found here."
1,"this is the second time that i have ordered this product and as before the package was received quickly and without any complications, even with me being in Iraq.  I usually mark on the calender when i order and when I expect to have the product and the Product arrive sooner then the usual expected time.  thank you so much for Tea it always helps me relax after a long day while deployed in Iraq"
0,This tasted bitter and smelled even worse. I'm sorry to say it was so bad I had to spit it out.  I don't recommend this flavor. I'm going back to the Banannamon ones which are delicious!
1,"I'm not sure why everyone is hating on these; I think they are delicious. Perhaps they had some other taste in their mouth and it mixed with the snack. I found it very tasty. The pieces are crunch, but not overly hard like the freeze dried bananas that you get in trail mix. I would say they are just a little harder than a potato chip. I found that as you where chewing them little pieces would get stuck in your teeth, but it was a minor annoyance. Give them a try, if you don't like them then at least you know you tried them."
0,These are horrible.  Very bitter!  My son loves Funky Monkey products but even let these touch his lips and either would I.  Do not waste your money!
0,These taste so bad - almost rancid! I had purchased a similar bag at a grocery store (same brand- plain banana chips) so I was surprised at how bad these were. Perhaps it's the Acai berry in them??
1,"Maybe its just me and the need to crunch late at night, salt rather than sugar. But these were bought to avoid pretzels or chips and they're totally delish, lightly salted w slight buttery flavor, good for dipping or just crunching with your favorite tea/juice/soda."
1,excellent stuff for ants. I have also used the straight powder which I like better because it does not smell. (You can smell this stuff through the unopened container.)
1,"My husband uses this product, and for the most part he really likes it.  We started using ladybugs for the aphids, and they seem to do a better job on them, and they are more fun to watch!  He uses this for white flies on the grapes and citrus."
1,"Arrived quickly, an d works great  Thank you for selling a product that works."
0,"I applied this product to several plants including a small tree, some hostas and a rose bush. Within two days all of the plants I applied this product to were dead. The grass around the plants and some plants that just got overspray were also dead. It could be used for a weed killer but I wouldn't spray it on any plants you like."
1,"My VET recommended this product for yard use to kill fleas which my Scottish Terrier is allergic.  Since it is out of season, I had to order it on line.  The service was prompt and has been applied to an acre yard.  I purchased two bottles of concentrate for usage.<br /><br />Now waiting to see if this helps the infestation normally in the South.<br />Linda"
1,This is the best mulberry jam I have purchased online.  It is equal to the best home made mulberry jams that I have tasted.  I highly recommend this product.
0,Did not realize that the jam they sent was not what i ordered.  I ordered mulberry and they sent me crab apple that is why i didnt like it.  too late to send back because i opened it
0,"Their products, at least the mulberry jam, do contain preservatives despite the info on their website leads you to believe. If you ask them directly they'll tell you."
0,"When I was a kid, my mom would save money by making Tang with less than the recommended amount of powder. That's what this stuff tastes like. The first two ingredients are water and corn syrup, which I guess explains the flavor, like a thin orange soda that's gone flat. And despite the claim to be ""Vitamin C Fortified,"" that's the only nutritional value this stuff has. It doesn't even have very much of that. So with little flavor, little texture, and little nutrition, I have to ask: what is this stuff? And why did I pay money for it?"
1,"Let me preface by saying that like most drinks on the market today this one only contains 10% and is mostly water. That being said, I LOVE IT! It's a great morning beverage for me for a couple of reasons. First, its a nice portion and can carry me all the way up to lunch at work. Second, I have a bit of trouble with orange juice as in the real deal, because my stomach acids and such don't handle it like they did when I was younger and the blend on this has never given me heartburn even on  the most stressful days! In addition, the drink is consistent, can after can the taste is the same, which you can hardly say about other beverages in this category. Lastly, it has some nutritional value as well, albeit not as much as I'd like with 25% of the RDA but still enough to help fight off the office yuckies. I can purchase the product locally for $.99 a can and when I initially purchase it here on Amazon I was able to find a seller for around $.75 a can and with Amazon Prime it was a great savings."
0,"...and that title's saying something. This doesn't deserve to be passed off as ""orangeade"" - the picture on the front is a massive lie. ""Orangeade"" is a flavor different from orange juice (apparently), but Arizona fails here. Take any orange drink you've had before, and half the quality. That's about what you're going to get here, folks."
0,"I am not convinced this product is organic and will therefore not buy it again. The packaging on this product leaves me wondering how organic ""Healthyway Organic Goji Berry"" really is. There is no independent verification authority to confirm that this product is really organic. As far as I can tell, it is not certified organic by any authority other than the supplier and distributor. The 'Nutrition Facts"" on the label have some strange entries like ""Quantity of Heat"" and ""Thick Protein"" which I do not understand. They sound like direct translations of Chinese to English. It is a ""Product of China"" as are most goji berries I have seen. My concern at a time when there is so much bad publicity related to food products coming out of China is that this product may be ""organic"" in name only and not in fact."
1,"I have ordered these several times and each time everything comes on time and, of course, the berries are wonderful."
1,Bought these twice now. Are really good and good for you. Different than what you might be used to but I eat them by the handful or put in my cereal. Loaded with antioxidants. Recommend you give them a try.
1,"I normally get my goji from Asian markets at a cheaper price but since I don't get over there too often (kind of a drive) I decided to buy them online.  Good packaging, great health benefits, lovely berries."
1,Kar's sweet & salty mix tastes great to me. Everyone I shared them with enjoyed them. I was expecting the raisins to be on the harder/smaller side. The raisins in the case I received were moist and plump. I will be purchasing this product again.<br /><br />UPDATE<br />I'm back for more. Thought I would add this information for anyone who is interested:<br /><br />Each 2 oz. (purple) package contains 280 calories; 19g fat; 115mg sodium; 26g carb; 4g fiber; 18g sugar; and 8g protein
1,"THESE ARE VERY GOOD AND EASY TO TAKE WITH YOU WHEN YOU GO OUT, AND JUST NEED SOMETHING FAST...THEY ARE SO GOOD WE EAT A LOT OF THEM, MY HUSBAND ALSO THINKS THEY ARE GREAT...<br />BUY SOME AND YOU WILL LOVE THEM..."
1,My husband loves theses. I like them except for the sunflower seeds in it. They are great for snacking and alot comes in the box.
1,"I like to send care pkgs of this to my college kids from time to time as it's exactly as stated; sweet & salty, and delicious."
1,This is my second time purchasing this product my son is away in college and it is very expensive to buy things for him this is a great buy and reasonably priced the shipping was fast i am pleased with my purchase
1,"If you haven't tried this chili powder yet, you should!<br />We use it on everything. Way better than anything you could find in the store.<br />Once you try it, you'll be hooked just like us!"
0,Beans arrived and were promptly ground and brewed. Upon tasting I noticed the coffee was a fair bit weaker than I remember when visiting Sant'Eustachio in Rome. 3/4 through the can of beans I flipped over the can and noticed the date. 2007. Wow. Talk about super expired out dated beans.<br /><br />Given the other reviewers postings -- I'd give up and just buy beans from somewhere else. It won't be the same but won't be as disappointing as these ones.
1,"We have been using the espresso grind of Sant' Eustachio for some time as an alternate to our more robust Italian espresso at the American Espresso Coffee Cafe, in Garner, Iowa. It is the smoothest coffee I have ever had. Besides the wonderful flavor, the gentle scent of wood in the aroma heightens the experience of this great coffee. It may very well be the ""best coffee in the world"". I know it is the best that I have every experienced. Our customers love it and often purchase a can from us for home use."
1,So glad to have found this coffee online. My husband remembers it from his many trips to Italy so I got it as a gift and he was thrilled! Tastes great
1,"These beans make a delicious cup of coffee.  I was originally distressed by the sell-by date on the bottom of the can--it seemed that the beans were old, but communication with the seller confirmed that the sell-by date is the European standard not the American and my beans had two years to go.  The seller and I continued communication by e-mail and discussed grind, grinders, pots, and of course, the cafe in Rome where the fragrance of roasted coffee extends throughout the neighborhood.  All in all, my purchase was entirely worthwhile, especially because the coffee is so distinctive and delicious.  Buy it!"
1,"Low acidity and medium-level roasting... therefore it's a good one to drink as an espresso shot without milk. But it's also tempting to try and make as good coffee (with milk-foam and sugar) as they make at San't Eustachio in Rome. A bit hard to find in the US... that, as well as the fact that the beans originate in fair-trade farms, justifies the higher price than other Italian espresso."
1,"The best coffee ever available now from Gustiamo in the Bronx.  Great product, speedy delivery, affordable price.  Don't have to return to Roma every time we need more.  Highly recommend."
1,"I came across espresso made from these beans at my friend's place in Amsterdam - who told me about this little cafe in Rome that sells the best coffee and how she lugged several pounds back to Amsterdam. A month later, and once I had returned home to San Francisco, I had invested in an espresso machine and the only thing missing were those beans. What do you - it's available through Amazon - just incredible! This espresso is for the serious drinker with taste buds that only appreciate exclusive Italian coffee. The seller shipped on time, great service too."
1,"Smooth,mellow yet flavorful coffee good for anytime of the day. I am impressed by the company's dedication to customer satisfaction. Will purchase again."
1,"Ever since I learned I can not eat cheese made from cows, I found good substitutes with goat cheese.  However, once I found P'tit Basque, I've not missed cow cheeses at all. It's creamy yet firm, is delicious, has wonderful nuances of flavors. P'tit Basque is my favorite cheese of all time."
1,"I read Ceylon was the cinnamon used before it became more expensive.  The US changed to the intense cinnamon we have now.  This has a very subtle flovor, very pleasant.  I have used in several dishes with excellent results.  The only drawback is the difficulty grating it; it is as hard as cinnamon bark."
1,"I had my doubts, I did.<br />But I mixed the concentrate with skim milk, put it in the microwave, and I had a mug of bliss!<br />It's been awhile since I had chai at a Starbucks, but I don't recall it tasting any better than what I made at home with the Oregon concentrate."
1,"I use the Oregon Chaie Sugar-free Latte mix every morning. It has replaced my McDonald's Iced Coffee addiction. I began using Oregon's product to save money, but found that I prefer the taste.<br /><br />That being said, I never would have tried it at the price offered by this seller. I get it for less than a third of the cost, even before factoring in the shipping.<br /><br />Yeah, for the product. Boo for the seller's price."
0,I am in love with this sugar-free Chai. However I will still trek to Walmart or other large retailer to purchase it for about $3/32oz container. This online retailer must be insane if they think people should pay this price. Make the trek folks!
1,Delicious and 0 calories! I make it with water and a little nondairy creamer to keep the calories negligable.
1,"I picked this up one day in a store due to my recent ban from sugar (I'm a gastric bypass patient), and I shied away from this for the longest time.  One day I just got sick of coffee and decided to go ahead and jump-off the cliff and give this stuff a try.  I made it per the instructions, but with vanilla soy milk (this milk was sweetned, which made the mix a tad too sweet for my taste), but it was DELICIOUS!<br /><br />I had really MISSED my soy-chai latte's from s-bucks, but now that I've found this, and can buy my soy unsweetned, I know I'll be really HAPPY going forward!<br /><br />Now, if I could just find this mix but unsweetned, it would really take the cake!"
0,"I googled Sucralose and found plenty of research to indicate toxicity.<br /><br />I wish Oregon Chai would make a chai which has no sweetener; most people would prefer unsweetened chai these days, wouldn't they?<br /><br />This company's chais are too highly sweetened. This is unnecessary. I have tried them and find them undrinkable.<br /><br />NOTE to potential chai product makers. Make a highly spiced liquid chai which is unsweetened in any way, using only organic or at least natural ingredients. You would sell it."
1,"I absolutely love this company...I've now ordered twice and never a problem....they ship very fast and curtious...I love them and actually will be ordering again this week,I use the pink hyamilian salt for the bath salts I sell...the sample salts I've tried are excellent...the Hawiian one is my favorite"
1,Wild Turkey Boubon Sauce is the best.  I first had this in Kentucky and I will not use any other sauce since I have had this.  I recommend everyone using this amazing sauce!!!!
1,"Yes, they are delicious. There is no doubt that the chocolate, peanut butter, and crisp, blend to make the most irresistible flavor ever invented, but to package them in 2 packs! Amazing. This would get a 4 star rating if they were individually packaged, but because of the pairing, this earns a full 5 star review.<br /><br />I wish that the bars would hold up to heat a little bit better. Even my immense body heat melts the chocolate on my fingers, forcing me to have to lick them off. Possible infection to airborne pathogens can occur, causing vomiting, sickness or dizziness.<br /><br />I also feel that they could have made the bars a little smaller; maybe bite size. Unfortunately, when you break the bar in half, you get crumbs. This can lead to ants on your floor, carpet or cement basement floor. Also, despite the risk of fireants, can pose a health risk to your dog, which we all know should not ingest chocolate in any way.<br /><br />In the end, I think the bars are a well rounded treat that are made in everyone's favorite math shape, the rectangle; or, when looked at on an angle, the parallelogram."
0,I bought this product for my fiance for Easter.  It was gift to get her excited about up coming trip to Quebec.  Much to our dismay the product did not have a shelf life on it and with in a week it molded.  We can normally store cheese for a while in our cheese drawer.  The sad thing was we were both looking forward to trying it.
1,"I'm Italian, and Gentilini were one of my favorite cookies growing up. Now that I live in the US, there aren't many things I miss of Italy other than food. And Gentilini are amonst those I miss the most. Luckily seems like Amazon is now carrying them. I love these cookies! A few cookies were broken, but all in all I'm really happy to have a reliable source og my favorite cookies."
1,"for those of you who don't know a demerara sugar is here's a definition: Demerara is used as the generic name of a type of specialty raw cane sugar often used in home baking and in sweetening coffee. It is normally brown in colour--the natural colour of cane sugar. It takes its name from the Demerara colony in Guyana, which was the original source of this type of sugar."
1,"This is the best sugar for coffee or tea. If you love coffee or tea, this is the best addition to your drink. I have been using this for 4 years and always find it to the be the best demerara sugar available."
1,I was and had been hunting for brown sugar cubes and this is the best price I found anywhere!!  I am thrilled with the outcome.
1,Found these wonderful little sugar cubes in a coffee house years ago and my wife and I enjoyed them so much so that we needed to get our own supply.  These are not only great with coffee but with hot tea as well and they sweeten the drink just right.
0,"The product is good--I have had three orders so far. The problem is with the manufacturer's credibility. One box was much lighter when I picked it up even though it was closed when I examined it. It was about 200g  instead of 500g with sugar cubes freely moving on a bottom of the box. I have no idea what happened and it is impossible to report it to Amazon--missing links, circular instruction, no phone numbers, no customer support links. The buttons on most pages, even on Returns page are ""Continue Shopping""."
0,"I started buying these about 6 years ago, the price was always around $4 a box.  Now they want over $6!!  My most recent order was early in 2011, and it will be my LAST.  There are plenty of other Demerara sugar brands out there selling for far less.  Save your hard earned money and buy one of those brands.  Paying $2 more per box just to have square cubes is insane in this economy."
1,"Ever since we went to England many years ago, and we were served coffee and tea with cubes of Demerara sugar to use to sweeten our drinks, we have been hooked on using these cubes. Not only do they add seetness to our morning coffee, but bring back wonderful memories of our trip. These particular cubes are all we have ever used for many years."
1,THIS PRODUCT HAS ALWAYS PROVEN SATISFACTORY--IT IS DELICIOUS IN MY MORNING TEA AND I ALSO RECOMMEND IT AS TREATS FOR  HORSES
1,I've been ordering this quite a bit - always a good product. This last order had a few of the cubes broken but this is not the usual result. Will definately order again.
1,"I just don't understand why none of my grocery stores carry these brown sugar cubes.  And I live in a big city - Denver !!  I did buy some once in another town.  But when you buy like this from Amazon, they are way cheaper by the box.  And it adds such a wonderful different flavor to my coffee."
1,"I typically drink hot tea without sugar, but after trying the satisfying flavor of this natural cane sugar, I found it very refreshing."
1,"Looking for the perfect ""animal"" cookie?  If you like cookies that tend toward the ""shortbread"" style, look no further.  If you want to please that special child in your life (or inside you), this is it.  I've also tried the chocolate chip variety from this same company, and it's great as well.  Enjoy."
1,"Heinz 57 is a long-time favorite of mine.  I always found it funny that they call it a steak sauce.  Steak is about the only food I *don't* use this sauce on.  It's great for french fries, tater tots, chicken, fish sticks, burgers, and pork chops.  Below are a few of my favorite ways to use Heinz 57:<br /><br />* Mix 1/2 Heinz 57 and 1/2 ranch dressing for a great dipping sauce for veggies, kind of like thousand island, but tangier<br />* Mix melted margarine (never butter!) with Heinz 57 for one of the best wing sauces ever.  Add your favorite hot sauce for more heat, but the pure mix is just about perfect and reminiscent of the infamous Buffalo Joe's in the Chicago area.  You can add garlic powder and onion powder to taste, too.<br />* Put a touch of Heinz 57 in your scrambled eggs or omelet before you cook the eggs.  Adds a nice flavor, almost as if they've been scrambled with veggies.<br /><br />The plastic squeeze bottles are the best way to go, too.  It makes it easy to get the sauce out, for whatever purpose.  I don't buy it in glass anymore."
1,"I know, I know: ""real"" restaurants frown upon this. You can't even get it at Outback, at least not around where I live. They consider it more like cheap condiment than real steak sauce. But I like it; it's got a tad of zing, and it goes with so much more than just meat. You can add some more heat if you want - just stir in what you want. I say sauce the way you want to. This quantity and size of bottles is the only way to go, and it compares very favorably to supermarket prices, given no tax or shipping."
1,"Well, it's a steak sauce, so what's to say?  I've always like Heinz 57 for its tart and complex taste, but some people might not, so it's subjective (surprise!).  I'll say that this deal (4 x 20 ounce bottles) for around $22 is a great price.  My local grocery stores charge about $5-6 for ONE 10 ounce bottle.  If it takes you a long time to go through 4 large bottles, give one away to a friend who shares your taste.  You'll still come out ahead!"
1,"Great flavor either as is or add to Heinz Ketchup or your favorite BBQ sauce/marinade for an added zing. Excellent as a dipping sauce for tenders, fries, OR's, fish & chips, etc. Great on burgers, dogs, chicken or beef cheese steaks, grilled sausage, brats, even breakfast sausage patties..."
1,"I'm not going to get too excited about soup in a can but if you are 1200 miles away from the soup pot, this is an acceptable alternative. I sprinkle a few fresh bacon crumbles in mine since the caned version has the flavor but lacks the texture."
1,"This coffee is right up there with Kopi Luwak Coffee and if you've ever tasted it you'll know what I mean. I love this coffee and the best thing about it is that it doesn't cost as much as Kopi Kuwak coffee. I'll be buying a lot more of this coffee I promise. It has no bitter taste to it at all like the coffee we buy from the stores. It has a rich, full flavor that will sooth your taste buds. If you haven't tried this coffee you are missing out on a very pleasurable experience."
1,"I love coffee, I drink it two times per day/every day. I expected this coffee not to be so good because of a few bad reviews that I read but I like it. I would definitely buy it again (different type bec I want to try new things). I wouldn't say that this was the best coffee in the world ever but it was good for me. Definitely million times better than Folgers, Maxwell, Sam's Choice coffee's and the Kroger brand coffee-not as good as Starbucks but cheaper than Starbucks so I think it is a good buy."
1,I have never been a big coffee drinker. But this is a very good coffee.  The most important requisite for good coffee to me other than flavor is smoothness.  And this coffe delivers that in abundance.<br />Great coffee!  Great price!
1,"This is an excellent value, a smooth, exceptional taste for a great price.  Unlike so many other American coffees, Costa Rican is both distinctive for a lack of bitter aftertaste and a full flavor.  I have served to guests for breakfast and after dinner with equal comfort that this is a great coffee."
1,"I have found that buying this coffee through Amazon is convenient, reasonably priced (esp if you don't pay shipping), arrives timely, and is of good quality. The Costa Rican beans appealed to my taste alittle better than the Guatemalan."
1,"This coffee is so good!  Rich flavor, not acidic, fabulous aroma!  I've had friends in from all over the country and they are ordering it now.  I find I use more per pot than I would of other coffees, but the flavor is always rich and not bitter or acidic."
1,Great by itself or use it to blend with other grinds. Medium roast isn't as bitter tasting - no matter how much you grind it.
1,"I bought three different varieties at the same time:<br />  Panama Bouquet Blend, Costa Rican Blend, and Guatemalan Blend<br /><br />Of the three, I liked the Panama Bouquet Blend the best overall, with the Costa Rican Blend a very close second.  The Guatemalan Blend is fantastic too, but it has a slightly heavier chocolate note and a dark acidity that I tend to shy away from (but Starbucks drinkers will like it better).<br /><br />For anyone that has actually been to Costa Rica, and you are searching for that same cup of coffee that you were served at the resort/hotel, this might be it.  I had the occasion (twice) to have to do some work in Costa Rica, and then afterward was frustrated at my attempts to find the similar lovely rich-cocoa taste that I'd had, until now.  This is it.  This is the real MCoy.<br /><br />In my world, only the (Copper Moon) Panama Bouquet Blend might be better, but the Costa Rican Blend is a bit more chocolaty, and has a bit of acidity that lets you know it's coffee and not a hershey bar.  Even though it has SOME acidity, I don't mean that it has anywhere near the kind of acidity that you will find anywhere else on the planet.  This is smooth, and rich, great aroma, chocolate finish.  Only the Panama Bouquet Blend has less bite than the Costa Rican Blend has.<br /><br />I will re-order this myself, because I like it best in the afternoon (I always have morning and afternoon coffee, Panama Bouquet in the AM, and Costa Rican Blend (or Guatemalan when the mood takes me) after lunch)."
0,"I had high hopes for this coffee.  I was quite disappointed.  Costa Rican coffee is, generally, my favorite. This is actually a blend of costa rican and something else.  The taste was bitter instead of the smoothness I find from coffees from this country.  I would rather drink fulgers instant coffee than this.  It's cheaper and tastes better."
0,"This is the second time I've made the mistake of ordering a food product from Amazon.com and received close to expired product!<br /><br />BEWARE.... BEFORE YOU ORDER....<br />YOU CANNOT RETURN FOOD PRODUCTS. SO, IF THEY SEND YOU SOMETHING THAT IS CLOSE TO IT'S EXPIRATION DATE, YOU'RE STUCK WITH IT!!!!!<br /><br />Although customer service did refund my money, the fact remains...they shipped me old product just to clear it out of their warehouse. Why would you trust a company that does that, not once, but twice?<br /><br />LET THE BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!"
1,"This cheese sauce is amazingly delicious. It is quick & easy to make, turning any bag or box of macaronis or noodles into mac & cheese. Also great if you add a little marinara sauce to it. I ordered 2 boxes of it, & they arrived promptly & in good condition. def would recommend this product from this seller. great product, great service, great price."
0,"Normally love this product and was excited about the individual packaging, HOWEVER, the cookies had a funny plastic-like taste to them.  Wondering if the plastic in the packaging off-gassed into the product.  Blek."
1,if you want to buy more then what they offer here try thenutfactory. smallest order you can get is 2 pound and it does have a lot more flavor then these here do. but if you like small packages then these here are just fine. i eat these here all the time
1,Great snack with lots of crunch crunch and spice.  Product as described and fast shipment.
1,"This mix is superb in taste, easy to mix up, just add water. It rises easily and bakes well. The best product for sweet rolls I have ever used. The taste of the batter reminds me of a cream cheese pastry batter for rugelach. Just ordered some more of this. I used this mix  to make sticky buns, but I used a lower  temperature setting per a cookbook recipe,  and baked them at 350 degrees for about 25 minute. They were yummy!!<br /><br /> Amazon, please keep this in stock. It is a Winner!!"
1,"The label is very inviting and the product is very tasty and satisfying.  If you love tomatoes -- and I do -- you will like this product.  I add it to any dish where I want to boost the impact of the tomatoes in the recipe.  And an added health benefit is that processed tomato products are even higher in lycopene than raw tomatoes.  Lycopene for your health, Contadina for your tastebuds."
1,"I like these pumps, but like any pump, they require cleaning every so often. The less frequently you use them, the more you need to clean them, especially with the white choc sauce. I wrap the opening to the white choc pump with plastic wrap to keep it from drying out. Just remember, you are using a sugar liquid with this... it may crystallize and need to be cleaned with hot water =)"
0,"I got the bottle of chocolate and pump as a gift. Worked great at first. Then, it quit pumping chocolate. As the bottle was still over 2/3 full of syrup, I realized that the shaft of the pump only reaches 1/3 of the way down the bottle. Really?! Do enough morons really run Ghirardelli that this passes for a decent product?! It's nothing short of remarkable. If it were my company, heads would roll."
0,"If you buy these sauces directly from Ghirardelli, they send you a free pump with every bottle.  Don't pay for one!"
0,"Simply put, it doesn't stay primed.  I had to repump and prime daily --- and BTW, I didn't like the ghiradelli sauce AT ALL.<br />Very disappointing."
1,"I discovered this while vacationing on the Big Island of Hawaii.  It has a pleasant, very tart and fresh taste - so unlike most sugary jams and jellies.  The passionfruit flavor is very prominent.  It is a bit runny.  I love it on toast."
1,"Tastes great with Holsum brand Peanut Butter, Jif is good too, but Holsum is my all time FAV, and amazon doesn't carry it.<br /><br />These are great snack crackers, that go with milk, rice milk or coffee, but this price is really high. I was expecting/hoping 18.00-25.00 for 6 boxes, not 54.00. Discounts go for about 3.50 a box [ food 4 less/ultra ]....retail like at Jewel is over 4.00"
1,I grew up with this graham and this taste.  So far nothing else comes close.  Amaazon's price seems way too high.
1,"Good job on the new packaging.  Still not resealabe so go soggy unless you wrap in saran wrap, and now you need a pair of scissors to open them.  Good job."
0,"I love Nabisco Grahams, but according to this ad, each 14 ounce box is over $8.00.<br />Are you freaking kidding me?!"
1,the flavor of the product is great in every thing i have used it in and i will but more soon and try other products.
1,"I was given this product as a gift a couple of years ago. Up until that point I thought all ""bases"" were the same. NOT SO!! Minor's has more flavor and tastes fresher than anything I have ever used. I cook with  all the bases but I'd say the flavor that gets the very most use (on a daily basis) is the chicken. I could not live without them all. Thank you Minor's, for making a product that is so worth purchasing and using! Can't live, or at least cook, without my Minor's!"
1,"Very nice, good tasting oil. This is the first time I've had this type. Want to try it to make ice cream like Alton does on ""Good Eats"". I must say though, that as far as nut oils go, I prefer the Hazelnut Oil from Samur, France. To be fair, though, I haven't tried this in a salad, yet. The flavor is good, true, and rich, though. Definitely worth a try, if you like Pistachios!"
1,This oil is amazing! Really wakes up your salad and is great along side a high quality balsamic to dip bread in.
1,I needed pistachio oil for a specific beet recipe.  This oils works perfectly.  I even like the small size so the oil is used before it gets rancid
1,"I am not the kind of person who hears about a miracle cure and rushes out and buys it. The tops of my feet and ankles were starting to hurt, I am a UPS driver and it had been a rough peak season and every year I am getting older and every peak seems to be getting harder. At first I thought I was getting gout , although the symptoms didn't quite match up. I looked up remedies online ( I hate taking prescription drugs needlessly, sometimes the cure is worse than the problem) Tart cherry juice was supposed to flush Uric acid from your system. I didn't have gout but the tops of my feet and ankles stopped hurting in about three days of using the juice. I bought tart cherry pills from Whole Foods they work but not as well as the juice. Hey it worked for me , I'll continue using it"
1,this is a sinfully tasty low carb snack..but  beware of sweetner malitol..eat too many and poops will rule your day!!!..russell stovers has entered the low carb..sugar free snack market with a bang..enjoy!!!
0,"Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read ""maltitol"" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!"
1,"These sugar free snack bars are amazing. Taste like the regular sweetened bars. I agree with the reviewer who warns about eating too many, though. They do have a laxative effect if you overindulge.<br /><br />However, the price, $9.99 is ridiculous! They are $3.99 on the Russell Stover's website, and at Rite Aid. (Sometimes less at RA if on sale). Please, don't be fooled into paying so much for a box."
0,A box of 5 for 9.99?<br />What happened to the case of 5 boxes for 37.95?<br />This single box price is a rip.<br />Its still the best of the 3 bars made.
1,THis product is wonderful.  I cannot have sugar and it really takes like the real thing.  Love it.<br />This is a must have for low carb dieters.  Give it a try.  You wont be sorry
1,awesome product..no aftertaste at all..low in calories and sugar free..I have one or two each morning and it has helped me lose wieght over the last 18 months.Product arrived in 3 days and all the bars were fresh and in good condition..
0,"The order arrived in a timely fashion & was well packed including an ice pack to keep the bars from melting.However, I ordred ""Chocalate Delight"" but received ""Cinnamon Bun"" instead. Upon reading the ingrediant list my mom discovered that the bars contain hydrogenated palm oil, a transfat. After a call to Russel Stover Candies, whence the bars were shipped we discovered we would have to do a return/exchange through Amazon. Well the bars are tastey & the whole return process seemed too convoluted to deal with so we'll keep them or maybe hand them out on Halloween to bad children."
1,"I was skeptical at first, but I wanted to give this product a chance. I've been having hot flashes for 10 years! I went on HRT for awhile but had to come off (you can't stay on it forever). After I stopped the HRT, the hot flashes returned. I tried Restore, not expecting much. I carried it around because you're supposed to spray it as soon as the hot flash starts. I spray it on my neck and chest and immediately feel better!  I really like this product!"
1,"Product really works. I bought some for my friends and they happy with the results too. If you are having hotflashes, this temporary relief is for you."
1,"I must admit, I was a bit sceptical about this product. Once I tried it, I was amazed as to how effective it was. A few spritzes and my hot flash dissapeared. I keep a bottle constantly within my reach. It is a phenominal product and a great find."
0,I tried this a few times - glad I got the smallest size because it didn't work at all for me.  Cool Off towelettes work much better.
1,"Hot flashes, one per hour, 24/7, since complete hysterectomy in 1988.  Breast cancer in 1998, so no more hormones.  I use this product, 3 sprays on neck, and I get maybe 50% to 75% relief!  No kidding."
0,"Thinking it would provide the relief I was so desperately seeking, I ordered this product with great excitement.  Unfortunately, for ME it was a bust.  I would compare it to throwing a cup of water on a house fire!  There are so many products out there that claim to help, but prove to be a disappointment."
1,"I was so utterly impressed with the packing of the plant (didn't make a sound when I rolled the box to check integrity) and the care taken to ensure the plant was safe and warm (heat pack included and STILL HOT!).  Not only was I grateful that it took a full twenty minutes to unwrap my Orchid and the size and color were impressive, but I even liked the fact that the medium was dry, which decreased on shock and potential freezing of the roots if it were lost in the mail.  I just received this orchid yesterday and literally cried AND kissed the leaves! It was B E A U T I F U L !  I was impressed in the size and quantity of pseudo bulbs. In fact, I was so impressed that five minutes ago, I order THREE more Orchids from this grower. A Wilsonara Kolibri, a Degarmoara Hani Star of Unicorn, and an Odontocidium Catatante!  I cannot wait to get them. They will be kissed to death just like my Sharry!  I have wanted one since they started being available online and the prices and sizes baffled me. $80 or more for a plant the size I got from this seller!! Not only that, but the cheapest ones, which were about $30, were barely over four inches tall and only had one pseudo bulb!  I am close to tears right now. I cannot say how impressed I was. The Orchid pot was covered in paper towelsls which were taped atop the bark mix, the entire plant was wrapped in SHREDDED newspaper INSIDE more paper wrapped around that AND taped THEN covered in packing peanuts AND the heat pack was TAPED to the box, so it didn't knock around and damage the Orchid! I have NEVER seen someone take such good care of a plant. I had another order arrive the same day from another company, in which I had ordered two Maranta Prayer plants. The soil was only covered with tape, nothing really to keep it in the pot (soil actually came through the bottom of the box) and they were set in the box unprotected and only surrounded by a few packing peanuts. The box was way oversized, the heat pack was ice cold, the plants could be heard moving just by tipping the box. Needless to say they were in complete shock! That is what I usually expect, and I prepare for it. This I was NOT prepared for. This order I am beyond pleased with. I cannot wait for the three I just ordered today. You have my total thanks and the packing is why I came back. Well, and the price. Haha. Thank you eternally."
1,"Amazing!  Amazing!  Plant was received very nice and healthy, bigger than the picture.  Nicely packed.  Mailed to me on Saturday, received on Monday.  Thank you!"
1,"wonderful little seedling. Can't wait for it to get big enough to flower. It was well packed with shredded paper around the leaves and pot, then wrapped with paper and taped well. the outer box was of a heavy cardboard and very well taped closed. There were 'fragil' 'handle with care' and 'do not freeze' labels all over. shows that the people that did the packing really care about their product. Everything was just as I hoped it would be."
1,"I had this shipped to a very dear friend who has taken up orchid growing. I didn't see the orchid myself yet, but my friend was beyond thrilled with it. It arrived in perfect condition (must be some brilliant packers at this grower) and it ws a very healthy specimen that she was excited to watch grow. I would definitely use this grower/shipper again based on my friend's report."
1,"My orchid arrived within about 2 days after I ordered it and was perfectly packaged and healthy. Please do remember, it is a seedling and will take up to two years before it is mature and flowering! I've had mine for a month and a half now and it is doing beautifully!"
1,"This was a great deal for a chocolate orchid, which is quite pricey, and came in a well cared for manner as well as looking very much alive. It did not come ready to bloom as stated in the details of the item but it is on its way to blooming and think this is a very good product for a person who knows how to take care of orchids."
1,These decorations are perfect for whatever you are making for Valentine's Day!  Sprinkle them on cupcakes or cookies.  Dip pretzels in chocolate and sprinkle the chocolate before it cools.  Can be used year round for a fun sparkle of pink/red on your desserts.
1,These were exactly what I was looking for to add a finishing touch to my Valentine's Day cookies!  Arrived quickly.
1,The taste of this Balsamic Vingear is very good for the price!!! Vinegar comes in a spray bottle wonderful for salads & cuts down on waste when you added to anything else!!! Vinegar comes in a six pack each bottle 8.5 Ounces.Price $33.25 for six pack but some of the Very Best sells for Over $100 a 4 Ounce bottle. I never tasted that Quality but like I stated earlier DeLallo tastes deliteful & its made in Italy!!!
1,"I am a nurse that has suffered with GERD or acid reflux. After also suffering the side-effects of medications like prilosec, I was introduced to this product. By the time I finished the bottle, I no longer needed the medication. It has beneficial enzymes that aid in the breakdown of your food, it enables you to absorb more nutrients, and helps you achieve regularity if you don't already have it. In addition to that, it helped my whole family reduce allergy symptoms. Even if you have great insurance that will cover the cost of your meds, this alternative is worth every penny. Trust me--I'm a nurse!"
1,"I can tell by the packaging that this product was geared for kids, and it makes for a completely trustworthy snack. But I have to say that I loved it too! I'm currently on a kick to eliminate refined sugar from my diet, and it's been a challenge. But products like this one make it doable.<br /><br />Bear in mind that this isn't just dried fruit, it's freeze-dried...devoid of moisture. That may sound unappealing, but it's really good--the texture is crunchy, and you can soak it in your mouth for really long flavor. There's no added sugar in this, but it's really sweet on its own. I use it for dessert or whenever I need a sweet fix."
1,"I absolutely LOVE this stuff! I love the crunch, and knowing I can eat the whole bag guilt free because it is a healthy low calorie snack. So far this is my favorite flavor, but I still need to try the pineapple lime ~ I can't wait!!!"
1,"I've tried nearly all available low calorie freeze-dried pineapple snack treats.  ""Funky Monkey"" ranks at the TOP of my list!  This wonderful freeze-dried pineapple snack is imported from Brazil.  It's all natural and gluten-free.  One one-ounce package contains 110 calories.  It has the best flavor of all the freeze-dried pineapple snacks I've tried ever.  The pineapple chips have a crunchy texture that's like eating candy.  If you live in California, you can find them at your local Ralph's Super Market.  Unfortunately my local Ralph's runs out quickly.  Thankfully Amazon provides me with a way to satisfy my craving for Funky Monkey.  Be sure to get the 1-ounce packages.  The 1/3 ounce packages are disappointingly small portions.  However, if you are dieting then go with the small packages.  They make a satisfying low calorie snack to get you through the day.  I highly recommend this product!"
1,I like this flavor of the Funky Monkey snacks best.  It's tart and not too sweet.  This makes a gret snack to keep at the office or for the kids!
1,"Being diabetic, I always carry one of these little delicious, no added sugar snacks in my purse, in case I need a pick-me-up to prevent low blood sugar. Another thing in its favor is this snack is gluten-free. Ordering from Amazon is fast, and they always seem to have the food products that I need."
1,"My little guy loves these snacks.  I like that they are healthy, relatively mess-free (as much as anything can be with toddlers), and easy to take along anywhere."
1,"This is delicious and my kids love it.  As far as I can tell, it's actually dried pineapple with guava dusted on it, rather than chunks of guava, as other reviewers have described.  Perfect lunchbox snack when the kids want something sweet and I want them to have something healthy!"
1,"Our family loves dried fruit as a healthy snack, but the Pink Pineapple flavor of Funky Monkey is beyond a doubt the best we've had.  My 3 and 5 year old children and I eat it regularly.  It makes a healthy dessert substitute, a delicious after-school snack, and a simple way to pack a serving or two of fruit in a school lunch box.<br /><br />The pink pineapple product is made of freeze-dried, organic pineapple.  A light powdering of guava paste gives it a subtle pink color and guava taste.  This freeze-dried fruit is very crunchy, and I've noted that it stays crunchy with the package open much longer than other freeze-dried fruit products that seem to absorb moisture from the air quickly and turn spongey.  Ew!<br /><br />The .42 ounce size is a perfect size to put in a child's lunch box and delivers a full serving of fruit and 40% of your Vitamin C for the day.  The 1 ounce size makes a reasonable snack for an adult, shared between two children, or for one hungry after-schooler.  You will be surprised how quickly 12 packs of this versatile snack will be used.<br /><br />Pink Pineapple Funky Monkey packages contain full servings of fruit, are gluten free, fat free, vegan, raw, all natural, 95% organic, and have no added sugar, color, flavors, or preservatives, .  What's not to like?!"
0,"I had high expectations - 50% pineapple 50% guava<br />Turned out it is 100% pineapple 0% guava<br />I could not find even a single piece of freeze dried guava in 4 packets i finished.<br /><br />The freeze dried pineapples get 5 stars and the product is overall satisfying, though you will finish a featherweight packet in seconds and then have to resist the urge to open the next packet to fill a void. Since the company deceived me you get 1 star."
1,"I wish they had included directions because it cost me some trouble shooting to figure out the proportion of milk to powder, but after a few tries, I got it down and it was deeelish!"
1,"Acana Grasslands is one of the only dry kibbles I didn't have to mix into another food (or transition in) for it to be accepted by my one year old cats. They dove right into it.<br /><br />It's an all breed, all lifestage grain free kibble made by Champion Foods, who also produces Orijen. They are Canadian based and tout having regional meats delivered each day to add into their formula. They utilize regional ingredients and likely, regional suppliers. I'm cool with that.<br /><br />I mix Acana 50/50 with other high quality kibble as part of my rotation. Acana kibble shape is round and flat. The colour is very dark and if you're transitioning from a light colour food you'll note kitty's darker 'output'.<br /><br />I believe it's true Acana is more fish based than Orijen, but it's an excellent quality food which I'll continue to purchase. I like to buy the smallest bags available and plan to try Wild Prairie formula next."
1,"This is the best dry catfood I have tried to date.  A friend recommended it and I can't praise it enough.  So good I was initially using it as cat treats to teach tricks while I was transitioning from their old food.  This is grain-free with stellar ingredients and is sold for decent price by Amazon and most of the better online pet stores (petfooddirect, Mr. Chewy, etc.).  Good stuff and worth every penny - and doesn't cost any more than the cheap stuff in the long run because with this you are feeding quality not quantity."
1,"Obviously the candy was delicious, the packages inside the box were smaller than I find at the local stores.  shipping speed was good."
1,"I was involved with a Teach-In at my daughter's school.  Since my subject was the visible spectrum and how rainbows get created, this box of Rainbow Twizzlers provided the perfect handout (along with some diffraction-grating glasses).  The kids went wild!<br /><br />Since there was a pack or two left over, I tried a few of the Twizzlers.  They were fruit-flavored and quite tasty when compared with the standard dark red Twizzler variety.  My daughter (and son) loved them."
1,These were perfect party favors for our tea party. The girls loved them all. I would buy these again.<br />Nice variety.
1,"I just had an adult Mad Hatters Tea Party and put a whole bunch of these lollipops in a vase as part of the centerpiece on each table, They are so detailed and beautiful and just made perfect Favors for the Ladies."
1,"I ordered these to go in the Party Bags for my daughters 4th Birthday Tea Party!  They were a hit.  I never got to taste one, but it was the first thing the little girls grabbed and I saw happy, messy faces everywhere.  They must have been tasty!<br /><br />Thanks for the smiles."
1,"If you are unfamiliar with miso find out about it.  If you know what it is be assured that this is the best.  Using a small amount is better than a large amount. Add this at the end after mixing it with a bit of water to dissolve. It should not even be simmered, add it and let stand."
1,"Working outside in the summer or exercising can deplete your body of necessary water, electrolytes and energy. This is a good tasting low calorie drink that refreshes you and helps maintain a healthy balance of what your body needs. Each 32 ounce bottle has 4 servings and each serving has 20 calories, 5 Grams of sugar, 110 mg of sodium and 30 mg of potassium. It replaces the salt you have lost from sweating and the potassium helps your muscles not cramp.<br /><br />This is an ideal drink for those lighter workouts or if you are diabetic and need to get refreshed quickly but don't need a lot of sugar. It contains the same electrolytes and hydration as the original Gatorade with ½ the calories and 1/3 of the carbohydrates.<br /><br />It is great for those hot summer days. It is best served cold and shaken before drinking.<br /><br />The unit price here is not bad but the shipping is extremely high. It is a very good product."
1,"Bookbinders White Clam Sauce makes linguini or spaghetti taste just wonderful.  Sauce is great, but the clams are tender, and sweet, making everything taste terrific.  Buy a lot of this because you'll want to have a lot on hand to serve surprise guests, or to secretly stash away, for yourself.<br /><br />Preparation is easy.  Make your favorite pasta, heat the sauce, and combine.<br /><br />icq3<br /><br />PS...Thank you again AMAZON for having this product available."
1,"Picked this up at the Milk Pail Market in Mt. View, Ca. Later read that the company was local (San Francisco) and I was very impressed with the taste and quality! I even got my boyfriend to eat a stack of three and he HATES sweet food :) Needless to say we were VERY impressed."
1,"I received the recommendation as a more natural healthy alternative to the more commercialized brands of avoderm, royal canine , and others.That have either reduced the quality of there food over time or bought out by larger pet food companies and drastically change the formuls. I was very pleased to have changed considering my english bulldog started to get allegies from those other foods. Her allergies eased dramatically once i started her on the Pinnacle. I find the food to be substantially better in quality and ingredient structure and heriarchy of the elements contained within. i find it equally comparable to Halo and Lonovo. The only negative is that if your dog has yeast problems inside and out then this product delivers its fair share of sugars(Carbs) from the potatoes which help fuel the yeast. i used for several months and would recommend to other dogs without yeast problems. good luck but, trying many types and finding the one that works is the best strategy."
1,"My pointer mix has a sensitive stomach, and he also has a sensitivity to chicken.  This has been working really well.  Solid stools and no more noticeable gas!  My small dog, a havanese , is also doing well on it, but he has a strong stomach anyway.  And they both seem to love the taste.  As an added bonus, the pieces are small.  So that is helpful for my little dog."
1,"Our dogs love this food and it good for them; no fillers, no corn, no wheat. It doesn't smell bad even though its made of fish. Highly recommended."
1,"This is a good value for an excellent dog food. She loves it alone, but I usually mix in a little ""Stella & Chewy's"" so she will eat it all up at once. Has really helped her skin allergies!"
1,"I was looking for good quality limited antigen ingredient diet that has not had a recall in last few years. This is no easy task, but Pinnacle is one of those diet. I feed the Salmon and Potato to my chocolate lab who was having chronic ear infections since he was 9 weeks of age. As soon started diet at at 6 months of age the ear problem resolve with in a week. He is now 2 years of age and I have not even had to clean his ears since starting this diet. Reputable company, quality ingredients, good comparative price, and no recent recalls on diets. Thanks Pinnacle for producing a quality product for my pet."
1,"I had ordered both fresh white trufflesFresh White Truffles 1 ounce ( White Alba Truffle) and some caviar close to a holiday weekend (on the Thursday before Christmas on Sunday) and I had done so without anticipation of getting them except in time for New Years. Shipping was noted as $6 for each of the 2 items I'd ordered.<br /><br />Not only did the seller notice the 2 orders shipping to the same location and consolidated the shipping cost to $8 for both. But they obtained my phone number from Amazon, called me to tell me that normally they overnight these types of items in any event, but while they would happily upgrade for Saturday Delivery at no charge to me so I would have the order for Christmas, they had worries that there was possibly no Saturday delivery in rural area (I live in Bridgehampton NY and they were correct, there is no Saturday deliver here even from Fed-X) and so, to avoid the order sitting around unrefrigerated from Friday till Tuesday, they were calling to ask if they should hold the order and instead ship Tuesday for Wednesday.<br /><br />Since I did not pick up my calls Thursday eve or Friday AM rather than just leave a voice-mail a call their job done, when I finally answered a call at 5:20 Friday, it was from a seller employee's cell phone, who had my order with him, in order to be able keep it freshest, pending an instruction from me, and so as to make absolutely sure they were following my wishes.<br /><br />As you can imagine the items received were commensurate with that service, and when they arrived Wednesday morning they were perfect IN EVERY WAY.<br /><br />And no matter how expensive the items (and they were the cheapest of their kind I found this season), this kind of service, while certainly also rare as the items themselves, is in my estimation, priceless."
1,"We've enjoyed this tea.  The wooden box is also nice - lightweight and certainly not fancy, but a nice holder for the tea."
1,"This product is by far one of the best cookies this universe has ever known. Tiny TRON discs of delicate and balanced crunch and chocolate that ebbs and flows like a dream landscape, reality becomes liquid candles and you are the wick... set yourself ablaze and eat these cookies.<br /><br />They really are the best cookies, I'd place them side by side with those LU Cookies Le Petit Ecolier, The Little Schoolboy which can also be bought here on Amazon.<br /><br />Why settle for boring cookies when you can eat the best?"
1,When I got this product it was packaged a little tight but the chips WERE AMAZING. Got the product sooner than I thought I would. All over all great product!
1,Great product. The taste is on fire! The Takis got here weeks ahead of estimated time.  Only problem is it is a small bag.  I will have to order the bigger bags next time.
1,"This are so good the little ones are the best and there hard to find in San Diego, Ca. They only thing is there expensive at this place wish they would cut you a better deal. But will still buy from time to time."
1,"Wow, love the Spices and lime.<br /><br />Spices Have a Real kick to them, and each one is well covered with them.<br /><br />Hard crunch but good crunch. After all it is a tight rolled up tortilla.<br /><br />Looking forward to buying more."
1,today i got my takis mini it came quick and fast it only takes 5 days for me to get my.but when i got it it taste great it came in a big bag and it was good
1,Great price daughter enjoyed. Perfect little snack bags. These would be perfect as party favors too. I will most likely order again.
1,"The products great! we love it and that is why we ordered it all the way from back home. We miss getting them all the Time in San Diego,The shipping started off slow but when they did ship they used 2 day so it is all good."
1,"As noted by others, this item arrived days/weeks ahead of the projected arrival (I've purchased it twice).  The packaging by Party Favors Club is well done; the chips are not crushed during delivery.  My boyfriend and I find the Fuego Takis to be addicting, so having a 200 calorie snack size helps with portion control--and a little really does go a long way!  The corn chips are crunchy, pleasantly spicy-hot, and have a perfect touch of lime.  Yes, I wish they were a little cheaper . . . but having 25 small servings does help them last longer than a single large bag would last in my home."
0,"Sadly, NO. This little boy in a hospital three states away from here wanted ONLY this package of Taki's (25 pack) from his father when he had to be transported 2 1/2 hours from his home in an ambulance....BUT...the product took too long to be delivered through the mail (?) apparently and the young boy was discharged about four or five days after admission so left the hospital before his package ever arrived. I assume it did arrive, never heard from the hospital and it was never forwarded...sorry!"
0,We bought this from a candy shop a couple of years ago. Make no mistake - this is not chocolate and it has no chocolate flavor. The orange in its name refers to the color it changes - not to its flavor.<br /><br />The directions call for you to mix the powder with hot water. If you do this it will taste terrible. It becomes only mildly acceptable (to some) when mixed with hot milk rather than water.<br /><br />Its only real use is that the empty cauldron can be used for a decoration around Halloween.
0,"I totally agree with the other reviewer.  I bought this (although I bought it with a Harry & David label on it so it was probably more expensive!) and no one in my family liked it.  It is not hot chocolate - more like what they call ""white chocolate"".  I thought it would be a chocolately orange flavor, yum.  Neither chocolate nor orange flavor.  Only the color is orange.  A big disappointment, I ended up throwing it out.  The cauldron is cute, but the words around the edge don't come off so it's not really reusable."
0,"Well I wish I had seen the two reviews above before buying this! It did turn orange, but it certainly was not chocolate. It tasted like a overly sweet and yet bland orange cream. Wreaked havok on my innards! Very glad we did not serve it at our Halloween party as planned."
0,If you are like me and just like the cauldron you can pick it up at Walgreens for just a little above four dollars.They have the coffins as well.
1,"I'm always looking for things to put these toasted seeds on. Great in salads, meat loaf and on sandwiches. Love them!"
1,"I never say it but I say it today...OMG! These are the best sesame seeds I have ever tasted!!!!!!! I was shocked at how crispy and tasty these sesame seeds are right out of the bottle.  It was difficult to stop eating them.  I use these in cookie recipes, on salads, on steaks, on PBJ sammies, in yogurt. These guys did an awesome job with this product, especially for the price. You will not be dissapointed."
1,I have had problems with high blood pressure so I changed to a low sodium diet. This product really helps me in making sauces and soups without sacrificing taste.
1,"Bonne Maman has done it again - captured the natural flavor of the fruit.  In the case of Bonne Maman Grape Jelly, the muscat grape flavor is so true that you almost feel you are using jelly Grandma made.  The color of this jelly is a reddish-purple; it is a clear, fresh hue - exactly like that of the muscat grapes from which it is made.  The consistency is not so firm that it does not spread easily, but not so runny as to flow off the sides of your bread/toast.<br /><br />I have found Bonne Maman Grape Jelly at our local grocery stores.  It sells there for $3.49 - $3.99 per 13 ounce jar; I have not yet seen it in some of the off-price retailers who generally stock a limited supply of Bonne Maman products.<br /><br />If you are tired of the grocery store concord grape jellies which taste like sugar and little else, I recommend you try Bonne Maman Grape Jelly.  It has a natural, true grape flavor and is worth the extra cost.  I hope Bonne Maman will expand their product line further and introduce a concord grape jelly/preserve."
0,"I bought this coffee at a local store.  It is truly the worst coffee I have ever had.  I first noticed the flavor was almost like burned plastic.  When I poured it out it looked pale, not dark. There were big pieces of what looked like pieces of grass or wood.  It had almost no aroma, but the bag was not broken."
1,I ordered this because I was looking for something to replace Millstone Foglifter after the price got so outrageous.  Wile not quit as rich it fit the bill will reorder
1,I took a chance on this coffee becaused the only rating gave it a one star.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I make my coffee one cup at a time with a mesh camping filter and drink it immediately thus getting all the benefits of the flavor before it leaves for the atmosphere.  Hopefully the quality control is such that your cup will also be pleasant.
0,This is the worst coffee I have ever gotten from amazon.<br />Not worth the time and effort I spent reviewing all the coffees at the site.
1,"So, I tried some of this coffee , I made a pot about five Minuets ago Ill try to describe for you what i'm tasting . Its ok , Its light but, not to light ,well rounded and I slight Vanilla taste witch I usually sum up to poor quality coffee . I think some people would really like this one , I prefer the Jamaican blue but , This is Vary good also .Ill try this on some friends I know like this kind of coffee .Coffee is pretty much personal taste , although I like something better doesn't mean its not great coffee ."
0,"I ordered this bag of coffee just to get my order up to $25 for free shipping but I won't ever order it again.  It's hardly even on par with grocery store stuff, a little stale smelling too  - it's sure no Peet's Coffee!  Of course Peet's costs a fortune!"
1,"Hands down this is one of the best prepared soups out there. Add 4 1/2 to 5 cups of water.  After it's cooked (about 30 to 45 minutes), I add yogurt to the bottom of the serving bowl, pour in the soup and mix. The yogurt helps to enhance the other spices. I sometimes add salt to this soup.  Yum!  It really is a favorite in my home.  If you love soups...try it.  You'll be pleasantly surprised at how good it is."
1,I love Sadaf products in general and their soups are so yummy. Really easy to make and taste so good. Great dinner/ lunch for winter time and you don't have to go through few hours of prepration. I also took them to our ski trip last year and had the Ash ready for 20 people in 50 min.
1,"I was looking for something with a good taste and less ""chemical"" ingredients so I decided to give this a try. BINGO! This is great tasting."
1,"Good opportunity to sample some of the various Timothy's k-cup selections and find your favorites. You can't beat the convenience and consistency of the k-cup system. Since I don't see that Amazon provided a description of what's included in the variety pack.....<br /><br />Includes two of each of the following varieties: Breakfast Blend, Kona, Parisian Nights, Espresso Extra Bold, Colombian Dorado, Italian Blend, Hazelnut, Colombian Decaf., Chai Tea, Green Tea ,English Breakfast Tea & Canarino."
1,"Great mix of flavors. Just read the fine print. This pack also includes teas, decaf, and a lemon drink which is just horrible. My coworkers don't drink tea or decaf, so I won't be buying this mix again. For those that do, this is an excellent choice. The Timothy brand overall is our favorite for our Keurig."
1,"While variety packs sound like a good idea, you should be aware that there is a reason you usually aren't told exactly what's in it. It's because almost always, the vendor throws in a bunch of flavors, blends, teas, and decafs that are not usually what you want. It can be a waste of money for most.<br /><br />A much better solution, besides sampling a friends K-cup favorites, is to go onto the Keurig site ( http://www.keurig.com/KCupResults.asp?AllProducts=AllProducts&mscsid=HGR8G81WMFQB9NS0DN0EH4MKJREN8UAF ) and buy their low cost 5 packs. They usually cost under $3 and give you enough coffee to help decide what you might like. Plus, you'll know exactly what's in the smapler before you buy it.<br /><br />It is also a great idea to visit the K-Cup Exchange on Yahoo http://groups.yahoo.com/group/K-CUP/  This site is an excellent source of K-Cup info and allows you to trade unwanted k-cups, and talk to others to find the best deals and brewing tips."
0,"I too was shocked that a third of the k-cups in this product were tea or lemon beverages.  Foolish me -- when I order a product called ""Timothy's World Coffee K-Cup Variety Pack,"" I actually expect it to contain a variety of COFFEE k-cups. Having to order a minimum of two boxes from Amazon only compounded the problem.<br /><br />I am giving this product one more star than it otherwise deserves because when I called the company to complain, they did send me one free box of just coffee k-pods. However, the combination of deceptive labeling and having to throw away a third of the contents of the box unused makes this a poor product choice in my opinion.<br /><br />If this product contained only coffee k-pods, I would probably order it again because the coffee k-pods actually in it were pretty good, but I certainly don't recommend it now."
0,"I have never ordered k-cups on-line before! Is it not deceptive, not informing consumers that the coffee is outdated, as mine was almost a year out of date. Now i am skeptical ordering k-cups again, also i have some more on the way as gifts, and hope these are not outdated!"
1,"Includes two of each of the following varieties: Breakfast Blend, Parisian Nights, Espresso Extra Bold, Colombian Dorado, Italian Blend, Hazelnut, Colombian Decaf.,  Green Tea ,English Breakfast Tea & Canarino.<br /><br />NO KONA OR CHAI TEA,<br />they sent  French Roast, Ethiopian Kimssa instead"
1,"It's hard for me the believe this myself but so far I have given 8 Keurig coffee makers away (five model B40s, two B60s and two B70s) as gifts and I always give this sampler to go along with the k-cups included with the machine.  I feel that it includes a very good selection of coffees and teas.  If someone does not like a particular beverage (some people NEVER drink tea for instance) the recipients have found that they can keep them on hand for guests.  This does not include all of my favorites but it does have a very good mix.  Here are some of the most popular:<br /><br />Hazelnut:  I don't know why but most of the women in my family (and many  of the men) LOVE this one.<br />Rain Forest Espresso:  If a person likes a full bodied coffee then this could be the one for them.<br />Breakfast Blend:  A milder, medium blend that a lot of people enjoy.<br />Chinese Green Tea:  This is becoming more and more popular in the US and my friends who drink tea like this K-Cup.<br />English Breakfast Tea:  A classic.<br /><br />And the not-so-popular ones:<br /><br />Italian Hot Lemon Beverage:  I have personally never met someone who liked this one.  I am sure that someone does, just no one that I know.<br />Italian Blend:  I usually like an Italian coffee but this one is not popular with my friends, family and guests for some reason.<br /><br />There are others in this pack but in my experience these are the ones that the people in my life usually love and the ones that they avoid."
1,"Hey, don't take the list of included flavors too seriously, I got different items in mine, and I suspect you will too... It was kinda fun to get the surprise flavors! Now if only they'd decide which flavors for which days, lol, I spend so much time just deciding which of the wonderful flavors to try each day!<br /><br />p.s. Rainforest Espresso: way strong. Good, but strong. Consider having some flavored creamer around in case you find it to be too much (I usually don't, but was lucky I did today)"
1,"Great sampler just got better! They no longer have the hated ""hot lemon beverage"" and instead have replaced it with Kahlua flavored coffee! YUM! I just ordered 2 of these, arrived here in 2 days even with the free super saver shipping and here is what I was in the box:<br /><br />-Parisian Nights extra bold x2<br />-Italian Blend x2<br />-Kona Blend x2<br />-Breakfast Blend x2<br />-Decaf Colombian x2<br />-Fair Trade Colombian Dorado x2<br />-Rainforest Expresso extra bold x1<br />-Hazelnut x2<br />-French Vanilla x1<br />-Kahlua coffee x1<br />-Original Donut Blend x1<br />-Mexican Organic x1<br />-Chai Tea x1<br />-English Breakfast Tea x1<br />-Chinese Green Tea x1"
1,I love this coffee.  Timothy's is a good all-around coffee if you're not sure what to order.  It isn't too strong and the variety pack let me try all the different kinds.
1,"I'm not what most people would call a coffee drinker. I love an occasional cup but I don't have to have coffee everyday. Being able to brew a single cup at home using my Keurig Brewer instead of running to St@rbuck$ saves a bunch of money. Timothy's World Coffee is some of the best tasting coffee around. I prefer the rich bolder blends. I got the variety pack, as it allows me to taste different kinds and find out what I like and what I don't. My shipment came very quickly and was well packed. I have been enjoying my occasional cup of java a bit more often since it arrived.<br /><br />I do wish they would leave out the teas they included. I want coffee not tea. In addition, if I wanted decaf I would have ordered decaf. They could have left the decaf out too. Otherwise its a pretty good mix."
1,"Yes, it does include tea, and a lemon drink, but now amazon does state that in the description.<br />What I found slightly disappointing was that I had mixed quantities of each item in the 48 pack.  I had 2 of some drink and 4 or 5 of another.  Makes me wonder if I was missing any flavors.  Just be prepared for a true variety.  I found Timothy's coffee's to be a much bolder, stronger taste than the Gloria Jean's variety I tried."
0,"didnt know there was tea in the pack-wasnt specified anywhere. I dont like the tea that was in there,and wouldnt have ordered it. Some of the coffee pods were too weak."
1,This box contains a pretty good mix. I'm not a big fan of K-cup teas and could have done without those.
1,"This box of k-cups has something for everyone: coffee in bold, medium, and decaf, plus tea. We opened it for Thanksgiving and everyone had fun choosing their own flavors."
1,I bought these for my parents. They LOVE them! There are at least 15 different kinds in each box. It's a GREAT variety of choices!
1,"This is an excellent way to have a variety of different K cups rather than just having the same ones day after day. The selection is very good, includes a couple of de-cafs along with other blends. I like strong coffee and Timothy's blends are one of my favorites"
1,"I've had my keurig brewer for a few years now yet I've not had a chance to sample several of the varieties included in this pack. I especially loved getting to try the Kahlua (pass), Italian Blend (interesting), Kona (not as good as I expected), and Parisian Nights (definitely will buy) since those have piqued my curiosity for a long time. I just never wanted to order four dozen of each of those k-cups at a time. I was also curious on how well tea works in K-cups and have decided I will stick with Stash bags for now. This is a great way to find your favorite k-cups without buying box after box. It's also great to have for guests so they can have some variety to suit their palates. I wish all of the companies that make k-cups would do this."
0,"*Previous lists don't mention the French Vanilla, which was incl.<br /><br />I've enjoyed quite a few varieties of Timothy's (and others)K-Cups and had little to no problems with them. Cinnamon Pastry is one example of a coffee I really enjoy.<br /><br />This variety pack however seems to be a mix of their least popular blends, or perhaps the batches that were slightly ""off"". And going off this experience I won't be trying any of the coffees in the pack on their own except for the Kona & Breakfast blends.<br /><br />The tastes were dark (burnt), bitter and unappealing, each cup made me regret my choice to reach for the coffee mug. Not to mention the after effects were not pleasant, I actually could feel the crappiness of these blends for hours.<br /><br />The French Vanilla was downright disgusting, I don't think they could decide if they wanted to make a soft vanilla flavor  or a strong vanilla liquor experience and it's a horrible mix of the two.<br /><br />Also, as previously mentioned, nearly half the box is NOT coffee but tea's that sound... more interesting than appealing.<br /><br />So if you're in for an adventure and don't really care about the taste of your coffee or tea, go for it!<br /><br />Otherwise... consider sample packs directly through the coffee company, they cost less and give you better options."
0,"The coffee was good, but there wasn't enough of it.  Ten of the 22 cups were tea or decaf.  A list of what's included needs to be added.  I wouldn't have ordered this had I known that there was so much tea in the pack."
1,"Delicious cup of coffee anytime without the waste of making a full pot.  After searching other sites, found that Amazon.com had the best price."
1,Makes a great cup of coffee and the variety pack is fun because it offers you the chance to try flavors you normally wouldn't.  Timothy's is a high quality product.
1,"I decided to try this variety pack, as I needed an assortment and it seemed my only option. It contains a nice variety of teas and coffees, but I was disappointed that there wasn't any hot cocoa. I don't really want to buy a whole box of cocoa but maybe that's my only choice. I'd like to see a variety pack of just teas or teas and cocoas but no coffee. Also, it would be nice if the amazon description told you what would be in the variety pack. I like Timothy's K-Cups very much."
0,"1st off, this is what is in the box:<br /><br />Two of each per 24 pack:<br />-Parisian Nights extra bold<br />-Italian Blend<br />-Kona Blend<br />-Breakfast Blend<br />-Decaf Colombian<br />-Colombian Dorado<br />-Rainforest Expresso extra bold<br />-Hazelnut<br />-Chai Tea<br />-English Breakfast Tea<br />-Green Tea<br />-Lemon drink<br /><br />I bought this so my husband could try the teas (he is not a coffee drinker).  I paid about $.33 per K-cup which is a good price, however I thought the coffees were not that great.  I prefer the Green Mountain brand and I suspect for me, it will be worth it to pay a little more for them."
1,"While I am getting over the sticker-shock of pod coffee, it's still cheaper than the coffee shop and I can keep my slippers on.<br /><br />This will give you a chance to find the coffee style you like but the inclusion of tea makes this more expensive than it needs to be.<br /><br />I recommend the Colombian Dorado. If you are a real fanatic, the Parisian Nights should tingle your taste buds.<br /><br />If you can gauge how much you will use, Amazons subscription delivery gives you the best price."
1,Timothy coffee is my favorite brand of K-Cups. I have tried 20+ different K-Cup flavors and Timothy is the best when it comes to flavor and consistency. I subscribe to this variety pack and receive it monthly. I like the variety including the teas (the lemon stuff is weird). It is refreshing to have a different flavor everyday.
1,"My wife loves the Keurig machine I bought her. I've tried the coffees and the K-cup system is the best coffee for the single-serve machines I've tried. Timothy's is very good coffee and at Amazon's subscription price it's more reasonable though still not inexpensive.<br /><br />For me, I still brew single cups of Yuban with Melita paper filters. Way better & cheper."
1,"This variety pack is AWESOME!  It is the best ever for my household.  It has 8 different coffee's and 4 different teas in it.  My only problem is that 1 of the coffee's is decaf, but my wife will drink those :)"
0,"I thought that I was getting a variety of coffee, not coffee, tea and hot lemon aid. There were very few products in this variety pack that I will use and I made the mistake of ordering the pack of 2."
1,terrific selection to get to know the product ... all different goodies ... coffee of various strengths & flavors ... several different types of teas & even an exotic hot lemon beverage ... great if you have a cold ... highly recommend !
1,"I enjoy trying different kinds of k-cups, so this variety pack was perfect for me.  Not only were the coffees great, I also enjoyed trying the teas.  The lemon drink though, I'll save for adventurous guests."
1,"pretty good selection and with the teas and the lemon drink, it provided something for someone who is not a coffee drinker."
0,"Three of the 22 cups were TEA, not coffee...1 Chinese green tea,1 chai tea, 1 English breakfast tea.<br />Three more of the cups decaffeinated Columbian.<br />If I had wanted tea, I would have ordered tea. If I wanted decaf, I would not have ordered a coffee pack, I would have ordered decaf."
1,"I enjoy that this product gave you a number of various flavors to try at once. I also liked that it wasn't one of each flavor (especially since there was two boxes) so that you could try them a couple of times to be sure that you enjoyed what you were getting or not.<br /><br />I noticed a lot of people stated that there was a plastic taste to their beverages after having these. I have not noticed a plastic taste in the ones that I have tried so far. I'm wondering if older ones that have been stored for longer may get this plastic taste?<br /><br />Someone else said that the Timothy's products had poor seals and would leak coffee grounds all over in the pot and into the drinking vessel when they were being used. I'm not sure if this is linked to a certain Keurig coffee pot or not but mine, the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee pot does not do this. I have also not noticed poor sealing in this cups either.<br /><br />I have also enjoyed the flavors that I have tried so far and I can't wait to try more of them."
0,We found this coffee<br /> to be  rather bland and fairly weak. For an assortment it all tasted the same. Won't buy it again.
1,"Good starter kit, It helped me figure out what I liked and didnt like.  I wish they didnt have the decaf coffees and teas and a few more of the Extra Bold but that is just personal preference."
1,Very good coffee and tea. Had a very good<br />variety in package. I had 14 different blends<br />with 3 being teas. Perfect to see what you<br />will like. My favorite was Hazelnut. The Bolds<br />were strong. Even the Breakfast Blend was<br />plenty strong. I used the large cup on the<br />Bold and run a second cup when I was down<br />to a third of a cup and it was still strong<br />enough! I will be using my own coffee since<br />these are pricy.....use two to make a 10<br />cup regular pot!!
1,"is a great sampler of different Timothy World coffee K-cups.<br />After trying Timothy's, prefer their brand over Green Mountain's (which is not bad), but Timothy's better."
1,This is a nice variety pack.  It gives you a chance to sample a lot of different coffees and tea.  I enjoy flavored coffee the best but also like to sample different styles of coffee and just use flavored creamer.  I really enjoy this pack and enjoy Timothy's brand.
1,My husband and I like the variety of coffees in this selection. Several have become favorites such as Parisian nights & the Hazlenut.
1,"Just purchased this last week.  Would have given 5**** but, price seems to have gone up quite a bit.  Mine was only $23. Great box filled with over 16+ choices. Great sampler only a couple K cups were duplicates. Will buy again, BUT ONLY if price goes back down."
1,"good variety.. not a tea or decaf drinker, so i won't be buying any more, but now i have figured out what i like and don't for later purchases.  thanks to those who posted the different flavors in the pack."
1,I like to purchase this variety pack because it has a little something for everyone. It gives guests choices from tea to really strong coffee.
1,I am not a big coffee drinker and I do not like to make huge pots of coffee for when I want 1 cup.  In addition to that it is great when hosting because people love to go through the assortment pack and pick something out.  They have a glimmer in their eyes like it is Christmas morning picking out a coffee/tea they know they will like instead of the same boring old cup of joe.  It is a real hit having variety for people.  Highly recommend.<br /><br />I am giving it 4 stars because of the stupid Italian lemon beverage.  That might be good if you get sick or something but I wanted a coffee/tea assortment pack!
1,"Really good variety here in this pack.  Not only do they have flavored and straight coffee, but they also included three different teas that can be used in the Keurig brewer.  They also included some Decaf as well.  Nice variety and good flavors."
1,"Just got a Keurig machine as a gift, and don't really know what coffees i would like.  My favorite brands of regular coffee don't seem to make k-cups.  I got this to try a bunch of different ones.  Some were really good, some ok, some pretty bad.  We kept a notepad by the coffee machine for my wife and I to keep track of how we felt about each one.  Now we are going to order a few boxes of our favorites from this set.<br /><br />If you are not sure what you will like in k-cups, or want to have a wide variety on hand for guests, etc, this is a good box to buy to get started."
1,"As many other reviews have mentioned, there is not a clear description of what is included in the box. I will not bother to repost the lists others have made, however I can say the variety is MUCH greater than the Gloria Jean's or Green Mountain Coffee variety packs I've tried (both of which include only Four blends of coffee), which is a definite plus. And I always set my Keurig to the smallest cup-size setting and feel this is the right level for maximizing the flavor of each k-cup - haven't tested how these taste with larger cups. Good brand overall, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Be sure to know that this package includes both TEA and DECAF COFFEE - you will be sorely disappointed if you're left with those at the end of the box because you didn't want them in the first place."
1,I was very please with the variety I received.  It had everythong I like and gave my a good chance to try everythin.<br />Thannk you
1,I liked this because I was able to sample many of the flavors and then choose the ones I wanted to buy a whole box of.
1,Great variety in this box from Kona to extra bold blends to tea to decaf.  It gave me an opportunity to try other flavors without needing to buy them in bulk first.  I would recommend if you are interested in trying other flavors.
1,"Wide assortment of coffee, chocolate and tea. All the coffee and chocolate were pretty good.  I'm not a tea drinker but tried one of them anyway. It was fine for tea, I guess,  but not for me."
1,"This is an excellent starter or tester box of k-cups. I did like most of the coffees enclosed especially the Kona Blend. I also found that I like the Colombian Decaf. It came in handy when I was in the mood for coffee late in the evenings.  However, there were two that were to bold for my taste. I am glad I made this purchase. Now I know which coffee blends I favor over others. In my opinion, it would be great if all of the k-cup manufacturers would sell variety packs. Timothy's Variety Pack gets two thumbs up!"
1,It is always nice to update our taste buds and see if there is a new coffee out there.
1,"Great tasting coffee.  no bitter aftertaste.  Spoiled us to the point of taking our Keurig brewer with us when we go visiting, even just an evening playing cards with friends.  Now we are asked if we are bringing  the coffee.  Kind of created a monster.  Our house is now the Coffee House.  Can't say enough good things about the coffee."
1,"I like this variety pack. There are a few items that I didn't enjoy drinking in the a.m. However, I may have guests that like them. This includes tea, which I like. Not everyone wants tea in his or her mix, esp. when the title of the box is coffee k=cups."
1,This variety pack contains a great sampling of Timothy's Products.  It was very enjoyable.
1,"The variety was great.  I decided to go with the subscription plan, and the coffee and the pricing can't be beat. I received the 24-count boxes (Pack of 2) very quickly upon placing my order, and I am looking forward to receiving this order each month.  I have tried various brands of K-Cups, and Timothy's has always provided great taste.  It was nice to not only have the coffee but the tea as well in this order.  I highly recommend this product.  There are lots of sites for K-cups on the web, but I don't think this price can be beat."
1,Great variety for anyone wanted to test a lot of types of Timothy's coffee and teas. Very smooth and flavorful coffee.
1,Loved the variety of flavors to try before committing to a full box of a single coffee flavor. I found a new favorite that I will be reordering. I would have liked it more if the description gave you all the flavors in the box. Think they should have more flavors in the pack. Thanks Amazon for the fast delivery and high quality customer service.
1,I have always wanted to try Timothy's Brand Coffee. And decided as a gift I could sample as well as my co-workers. And so I bought this box of 24 for us. Everyone one was very delighted with this variety pack. We will no doubt order again!<br />It is a great cup of K-Cup coffee!
0,"Coffees are ok, but 9 of the k-cups were tea. What a waste. I thought this was a coffee sampler pack. Won't buy again. Try Coffee People coffees instead...delicious!"
1,"Timothy's K-Cups are very good.  Timothy's and Green Mountain are my two favorite bands for my Keurig coffee machine.  There is a good variety of selection.  If you're a coffee lover, you'll like these."
1,Timothy's K-Cup variety pack is awesome way to try various coffees and teas without buying a box of everything. Good coffee.
1,While I really like Timothy's coffee- found the variety pack to have several K-cups I did not enjoy- far too many chai tea.
1,Received product and was pleased with quality and assortment. What a savings over local store prices! Will order again!
0,All of those thoughts will go through you head once you get this pack.<br /><br />Go with the Green Mountain coffees. And go with bolds. Even if you like lighter coffees. These k-cups have a hard time delivering on larger water sizes (not all types do.) There is some not very good stuff in this pack... It would be great if they sold with just one of each so you could quickly figure out what you wanted without having a lot left over.
1,"Timothy's World Coffees are always great.  Their selections are top notch, with coffee blends from mild to medium to extra bold.  The blends typify coffees from South America and Europe as well as the US.  There is a coffee for any time of the day or evening in regular or decaf."
1,"MY GRANDSON SUGGESTED I BUY TIMOTHY'S VARIETY PACK THROUGH AMAZON AND THE PRICE WAS GOOD.<br />I ALSO THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO GET STARTED, THIS WAY YOU CAN TRY ALL DIFFERENT FLAVORS TO SEE WHAT KIND OF COFFEE YOU LIKE WITHOUT HAVING TO BUY A ONE FLAVOR BOX AND BE LEFT WITH THE REST IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT!"
0,I'm really sorry I didn't read the reviews before ordering Timothy's Variety K-Cup.  What a disappointment to find 9 out 24 that I won't drink. I also ordered Gloria Jean variety and will definitely order that again.
0,"....buy a ""sampler"" pack that. a. Does not state what is in the box and b. Is waaaaaaay overpriced.  Are you kidding! $38.00+ for 44 coffee pods!  NEWS ALERT! - The going price is like $23.00 or less for 48-50 pods. Whoever orders this, deserves what they get. :|"
0,Have not received this item so I can't write a review!  Where is it?
1,I received the plant right on the due date.<br />It package very protective and the plants very healthy.<br />Overall I am satisfy with my order.<br />I canot wait for it to flower (so that way I can tell that I received the colour I order or not).
0,I reviewed this before...I don't think it will live but 9GreenBox said to wait for awhile to make sure that<br />is not going to live and if it does not they will replace it....
1,This plant was in the budding stage when I received it and in full bloom shortly thereafter.  Several gorgeous red blooms adorned it's branches. Desert roses are beautiful plants.  Thank you 9GreenBox.
1,"It took them a few days to fill my order but once it was filled it arrived the next day. Came in small plastic bag which was flat due to shipping. Had my pots and soil ready to go so planted them right away. Perked up the same day and I have new growth in just one week. They shouldn't even be surviving in my climate zone(North West AZ, its been 110 in the shade the last few days) but seem to be doing ok. Only get alittle morning and evening sun, full shade rest of the day. Please do your research about these plants, very toxic, I planted with surgical gloves to protect my hands from possible sap. Can't wait for my flowers to bloom."
1,"We LOVE Ian's gluten free cookie buttons!  They are a great-tasting little snack for my kids who can't have gluten but like an occassional treat and I love the fact that the portion is very reasonable, too!  Bravo! 10 stars!"
1,"Ok , well first I did not get the variety I ordered , I got the Crunchy Cinnamon kind , and I was going to send them back. Until I saw they were all out of stock... things like these save me , when we need to be out and about , now that we cannot have wheat. So we tried them , the 8, year old says they taste like  mini muffin tops, the 12 year old says , they are good coverd in milk like cereal , the 14 year old , who eats nothing ,ate them , and the two older ones did too , but in all fairness they eat everything..  we all like them , and Ian's is a great company to support , with wonderful kid food ,  for kids who can't have wheat ."
0,"I'm trying to figure out what it is that tastes so very peculiar and unpleasant in these cookies. Could it be the soy flour? In any case, I get no taste of chocolate chips at all. Zero. Zilch. They might as well have left that out of the name. The texture isn't bad. It's crunchy and not overly gritty. But there are better gluten-free snacks out there. I hope."
1,"These cookies not only taste great, but they are prepackaged so you can just throw them in a lunchbox.  When you have a child on a gluten-free diet, saving time on food prep is always appreciated.  They are definitely a favorite in my house.  We love them.  They are small in size, but are the best tasting chocolate chip cookie so far that we have found gluten-free."
1,"These are great.  I like the fact that they are in portion controlled bags which make them easy to throw in a book bag, carry-on bag or lunch box.  They are a bit hard so they don't crumble easily before you get to them.  The taste is similar to cinammon graham crackers."
1,"My three-year-old who can't eat gluten loves these cookies, and I've had them too and they're very good.  They're small, maybe 1/2 inch across, but they come packaged in bunches.  They're crunchy and sweet and you can definitely taste the chocolate.  A good product overall."
1,These are excellently portioned and very tasty.  My only complaint was that they are too hard.  I love them with coffee but for my daughter they were a too hard ---have to watch her VERY close when she is eating them.
1,Great GF cookie alternative.  My son loves them and he is a very picky eater.
0,"I was so excited to find these in our local Whole Foods.  I loved the fact that they came in individually wrapped packages (great  for travel, lunch boxes, etc).  Unfortunately, the taste was quite disappointing.  The cinnamon flavored ones were even worse.  Neither myself, nor my youngest liked either of them.  Granted, we are both somewhat picky when it comes to store-bought cookies.  I'd have loved to have given them to my oldest son (who has a real sweet tooth and likes most GFCFSF cookies I buy), but they have both soy and corn in them and he is allergic to soy and corn in addition to gluten and dairy.  Fortunately, I hadn't bought them in bulk on Amazon ...  I was surprised to see that they got such good reviews."
1,"This is a very delicious curry, and I loved the unique flavor it gave my eggs. It is spicy but you can adjust that to your taste. Went very well with basmati rice! The curry flavor overpowers the egg, but that is not a bad thing because it's so good! It tastes pretty much like any other Parampara curry though. I guess if you wanted to try out the recipe, you could add the eggs to any of the other Parampara curries, or even a generic red curry that you can make at home."
1,"Read the reviews and decided to try this. We've gone through the first box and have subscribed for monthly delivery. It is absolutely delicious. To make it even better, I add a little Creme Brulee Coffee-Mate creamer. That boosts it up to the absolutely-awesome category. At the rate we're going, we may have to up our subscription delivery to bi-weekly!"
1,"I felt compelled to write a review here for 2 reasons.<br /><br />#1  This is seriously, without a doubt, the best instant cappuccino I've ever had (and, perhaps, best cappuccino, PERIOD).  Originally purchased in canister format, the single serve packets are even better, as it offers just the perfect amount for each serving, and you can take it w/ you on the go.<br /><br />#2  The one and only review here is not indicative, informative, helpful nor is it relevant to the actual product for sale!<br /><br />I've given out packets to friends and co-workers.  All have come back w/ ecstatic responses.  I highly recommended this product.  You will not be disappointed!"
0,NOT mentioned in the product description is that the top ingedients are SUGAR and HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP!!! This is NOT a coffee drink.
0,"I ordered this item once and received the sugar free version.  Then on the replacement order Amazon sent, it was still the wrong product.  However, customer service was great and they refunded me within 48 hours."
1,These are great cookies.  The price is reasonable and I like that they are delivered to my home.  I have also ordered the vanilla and cinnamon for myself and the arrowroot for my grandson.
1,"We have been buying these for years now. My husband loves them in his lunch every day. They just reduced the size of the bag by 3 oz due to rising ingredient costs. Amazon had the best price on the smaller bags. The product is the same yummy chocolatey cookie as before, you just get less of it per bag."
1,All Natural the best cranberry sauce on the market!<br />You will not be disappointed ENJOY
1,"I love these baked lentil chips w/hummus. Everyday after work , I have a snack of lentils & hummus before preparing dinner. I have alot of food sensitivities and allergies and these are a blessing for someone like me. Thanks again for a great product.<br />Carole"
1,"I have purchased these in the larger size and love them! This size is just perfect to keep in my purse for a snack, especially for those times when others are having a dessert or snack and I can't eat theirs because I must have gluten free. My spouse, who won't touch any other 'diet food', loves these!"
1,"I ordered these chips after buying a bag of lentil chips at a store and wanted more without going to the store all the time and found these on Amazon. I love the taste and crunchiness of it and its a healthy version of chips with protein which would leave you feeling satisfied instead of craving more. The cracked pepper has a slightly sweet hint which I find interesting and took a bit to get used to. I would buy again, its too bad you can't subscribe."
1,"Saw these chips on Dr. Oz as an alternative to potato chips.  These chips work for me, but not my husband.  The chips have a light flavor, are crunchy and have a puffed texture.  I have just ordered my 2nd box of the 1 oz size to control my portion size because  I don't trust myself to stop eating before the bag is empty.  I hope this becomes a regular Amazon item that I can subscribe to and get Super Saver Delivery.  Perhaps Dr. Oz  should get a percentage for all the items and books that he introduces on his show that I end up buying on Amazon!"
1,"We discovered these as one of the snacks sent by a diet my husband was on.  They're good enough we then looked them up ourselves.  They're cheaper per ounce in the larger bags, but the 1oz bags are great for potion control.  All three flavors available on Amazon are delicious; my husband's favorite is the cracked pepper.  The rosemary is a reasonably strong taste, so I would recommend liking rosemary if you order it.<br /><br />I make fat free 'hummus' to serve with them (no sesame/tahini or olive oil, so it's not quite traditional, but that's necessary to cut the fat).  I just throw a can of chickpeas, juice from a lemon, salt, a handful of fresh cilantro, and varied roasted peppers & garlic in to the blender, until it's all mashed up good.  Delicious combination.<br /><br />I wish these were available on subscribe and save, since we would, in a heartbeat."
1,"I loved these chips when i got first time from Dierbergs.... but this size is perfect. you can also try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004D693CS"">Simply 7 Chip Lentil Sea Salt 4 oz (Pack Of 12)</a>"
0,"I tried this brand after having a successful experience with the 'Simple 7' brand and they didn't measure up. The baked chips are bland and they are coated in a film that changes their texture. They are to thick and just do not satisfy chip-craving. As the calorie in take is identical to that of the 'Simple 7' brand I'll stick with the latter, which is amazing."
1,These chips are very good.  Crunchy yet low in calories and fat.  I love the 1 oz size - perfect for my lunches.
1,"These chips make a wonderful snack.  They give you the crunch and saltiness that you need at times, without a lot of calories.  They also contain protein to keep you from getting hungry again until meal time.  They came in a single serving size package which is nice when you are mindful of portion control.  I would order them again."
1,"These chips are the *perfect* snack, especially for gluten sensitive snackers!  I keep these on hand, okay...I usually have 3 boxes (of 24) on hand because I can't bear to be without them!  :-)  They are tasty with just the right amount of sea salt - but wait!  You must try their cucumber dill and sea salt cracked pepper flavors too!  You will LOVE them!"
0,I normally love these chips and buy them in the large bags. The individual bags tasted totally different - makes no sense. I through them out and bought the large bags which tasted great.
1,"Boy, I feel like I hit the jackpot with these.  I have been searching for a chip that doesn't have onion/garlic/or tomato in the ingredients,,,,and are more protein based, preferably without wheat or corn.  And not only do these fit the bill, they are delicious!  Are light, low calorie, and absolutely yummy!  Great, great chips!<br />And an entire bag is only something like 100 calories!  Wonderful.  I think these may actually be the ""perfect chip!"".  Have salt, but just the right amount.  Whoever dreamed these up, did a great job and I am grateful, and grateful to Amazon for carrying them.  Thanks, Mediterranean Snacks,,,,,,,!"
0,"I ordered Rosemary Lentil Chips. THEY SENT 24 BAGS of cracked pepper. I can't have pepper! Instead of saying they are out of stock, they figured they'd send whatever and I wouldn't notice. Then they say you can't return food BUT I DID NOT NOT order pepper chips, I wouldn't do that. So good luck if you order from them because you will NOT get what you ordered."
1,"Dear Seller,<br />Thank you so much for the chocolates. My mother loved them, these chocolates were so good she almost cried tiers of joy.Thank you so much for the delivery."
1,"very good treats for your dog, they are soft and small, good to put pills in and my dog loves them!!!"
1,"I found out about these dog treats from my Mother who used to work for a Vet. The Treats themselves are great and my dog loves them!<br />But I paid over $7 for these treats and later found out I can get the exact same size bag for $2.50 locally, So I will not order from here again<br />knowing I can get almost 3 times the amount for the same price."
1,"My vet recommended these treats several years ago as a healthier alternative to the treats sold in supermarkets (like the treats shaped like fake bacon, sausages, steaks, etc). My dog LOVES these treats, probably more than she ever like the fake bacon variety of treat. She's not usually bribable, but these seem to do the trick. The only drawback to these treats from my point of view is that they're only available at the vet's office, so I'm thrilled to find them here online.<br /><br />Just a note about one of the other reviews I read: I purchased 4 packages of these at a time at roughly $1.30 per package, and the shipping was still only $5 for all 4 packs. So, even with shipping, the per-unit cost is around $2.50 (which is better than the $5 I was paying at the vet). And I don't think the package is misleading- I've only found these treats in 1 size, and they all have the same picture of a dalmation on the front.<br /><br />Finally, people have mentioned that these could be used to give pills. I think they're probably a little small for hiding pills (unless you're trying to give a 1/2 or 1/4 tab of a VERY small pill). If hiding pills is what you're going for, you'd be better off getting pill pockets (small, cup-shaped treats that you can mold around a pill or capsule)."
1,"These Lean Treats were initially recommended by my vet. I have a large dog, and the larger-sized treats, which I purchased for $6 (12 oz)  from my vet, are large enough to hide pills in, and also to tear into smaller pieces for training. I ordered these treats as replacements, thinking I was getting a bargain. HOWEVER the shipping cost was over $6 for a 4 oz pkg!!!! The pkg contents were not accurately described, as the size of the treats were appropriate for tiny dogs like chihuahuas. The pkg image is blurred, it shows a large dog, a dalmatian, and so further misleads the consumer. So, while the treats are great, the images and the descriptions need to be clarified. I won't order online again until this is cleared up. Perhaps if there were actual size pictures of the treats, that might help."
1,These treats are great.  The dog is crazy about them.  They are small but he really likes them.  You can also use them to conceal small pills if you need to give your dog medicine.
1,Impossible to find locally.  Can't be without them. Seller was very prompt in delivery.
1,"I purchased these little gems last week on a whim, after researching the history of the Abbaye de Flavigny. They have been making these candies since the year 1591! Anise is an acquired taste, I think, akin to a delicate licorice, and those who enjoy it will absolutely love these anise drops. A fact I found quite interesting is that it takes fifteen days to make just one of these candies!<br /><br />Each candy is roughly the size of a medium pearl, with a pleasantly smooth texture. They are not meant to be chewed, (the word ""jaw-breaker"" comes to mind!) but savored. The taste is exquisite: strong but not overpowering, herbal and sweet. At the heart of each drop is an anise seed, the texture of which contrasts beautifully with the hardness of the candy surrounding it. Very refreshing.<br /><br />I am so glad that I stumbled upon these! They are a real treasure in a world where artificial flavorings and chemical-based sweeteners are the norm. There is something quite special about these Anise Drops from Abbaye de Flavigny.<br /><br />As for the seller, Touch of Europe, I couldn't be happier with their service. My package arrived quickly, (two days before the estimated arrival time!) wrapped safely, and included a hand-signed letter thanking me for my business, which I thought was a nice touch."
1,"My first thought when opening a pack of these...was wow! They have MUCH more filled then the classic ones do, and even more than like ""Double Stuff"" oreos do.<br /><br />The cookie its self has a unique flavor that I can best describe as a sweet buttery shortbread type flavor. It's definitely not one of those cookies where you take them apart to get to the filling, and forget about the cookies lol. They are fantastic, and CERTAINLY worth a try if you have never had them. I am a huge chocolate fan, but not usually too big on sweets. But these have and always will be a classic and my favorite.<br /><br />Pros: Everything.<br />Cons: I can eat a whole pack by myself. I blame Keebler fully for this."
1,"The Keebler E.L. Fudge Sandwich Cookies, Double Stuffed are<br />very tastey, very satisfying. A high-quality product that I would recommend."
0,"I ordered the Hershey's Sugar Free Chocolate Chips.  I received the order ONE:In an envelope - not something I would send a food Product in.  TWO: The product looked Old and Out Of Date, the bags were cut (yet the packaged shipped in was not)and everything looked like it was melted together.  When I contacted this seller - he called me a liar and did not believe I received the items this way.  When I said I would send a picture - suddenly he hung up. I was told I would be refunded (including the $9.00 shipping fee I was charged plus my $5.35 fee to ship back) I still have not received my full refund!"
1,"I recieved my package today, much quicker than I expected. The items in the set were so fresh; also I really enjoyed the festive packaging. I love Thai food, and have recently am trying to adopt a totally Asian way of cooking for health reasons, I am now in my third week, and have lost 15 pounds, and pain from my fibro and RA is gone. In addition to the health benefits from Thai cooking, is it satisfies my taste...I don't crave fatting spicy foods, or even sweets anymore...:). I encourge those that want to try, to give it a shot...it's not as hard as it looks. If you live in area, such as I do..and have limited access to Thai ingredients, this package will get you on your way..to health wholesome Thai foods...thanks for offering this product...Pam"
1,"There ain't really a whole lot to say about these things but I still wrote a review that I hope others may find helpful just in case they have a need for these things. I bought these ingredients because I always cook Tom Yum Soup specifically the tom yum seafood. I am from Asia and I love to cook and I would rather use the organic ingredients rather than the ready mix flavor. My husband is American and he loves Tom Yum. I brought some of these when I went back to Asia last December but I already ran out so I had to buy some.<br /><br />  When I received these product, they were in an excellent condition. Considering that these are perishables, I got them still fresh and got them the way the seller had described/advertised them. The packaging was neat and was absolutely done carefully. The price for me is reasonable because you just cannot find these stuff in some groceries at least here in Texas. Nice doing business with the seller. So over all rating, I give both the seller and the product a 5-star rating."
1,"The package arrived on schedule and in good condition, with plentiful quantities of each fresh herb. No complaints, would definitely buy again. Perfect for lovers of Thai cuisine who want to try their hand at some home-cooked meals, but don't have an Asian market nearby to satisfy their needs."
1,"I realize that vendor reviews are in a separate area, but when dealing with perishable items such as this, the vendor DOES make a difference as to the quality of the item, and therefore also to the review of the item itself. I was skeptical about ordering produce in this fashion, but the other positive reviews and my desire for the ingredients won out. I'm so glad I took the chance! :)<br /><br />My order arrived two days before the earliest delivery estimate. In the high-90s heat we've been having right now, that makes a big difference, as did the fact that it was very well packed and obviously very fresh produce to begin with. The items were of excellent quality and generous portions. I can make an insane amount of Tom Yum soup now and have enough left over to throw together some other delicious dishes.<br /><br />Give it a try. I think you too will be very pleased! :)"
1,"Unfortunately my order never arrived.  After 3 weeks of emailing, I was able to get in contact with customer service.  Mam with customer service was very helpful and apologetic.  She made everything right and reshipped the order the next day."
1,"What more can I say? All the items were in great condition, tasted delicious, and made a great meal. I would highly recommend this product."
1,The ingredients arrived fresh and in only two days.  I made the perfect green curry taught to me in Thailand on my travels. Just placed a second order.<br /><br />A very happy customer
1,We received everything in the photo plus three unexpected Lemons.<br />Everything arrived fast and fresh.<br />We are going to freeze the excess veggies for future Tom Yum Gai Soup (Hot and Sour Soup).
1,Ate these in college in California---better than M&M's!  Can't wait to be able to order some (hopefully in less than 25 lb increment)
1,"Note: these are hard-core choke hazards--NOT for small children!<br /><br />Contrary to previous review, I found the bag to be clearly marked regarding allergens.<br /><br />These are not ""pebbles"". The image shows them roughly all the same size--they are NOT. They range from M&M size to small eggs. They contain a variety of fillings, probably not everything Koppers makes, but a nice sampling (dried fruit, cordials, nuts, hard candy). Also be aware, they do not all have chocolate inside; some are candy coating all the way down to the filling. Better be VERY confident in your dental work before you bite! This is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Actually kind of fun...not knowing what's inside. A nice introduction to Koppers products."
0,"Wow, in this day-in-age, one would think that products containing nuts would be clearly labelled.  I purchased this product, thinking it was coated chocolate.  I was aware that it was manufactured in a facility that has nuts, but the description does it clearly state that these candies have various centers such as nuts, fruits and other things.  I used these for a children's gingerbread house decorating party, and there were kids that had nut allergies in attendance!  Thankfully, all went well, but it is outrageous that Koppers does not clearly describe this product. Although not the tastiest candy, the overall quality was good, not great."
1,"This product is hard to find in my area, so even though I didn't need an entire case, I purchased them and handed some out to other family members over Thanksgiving. I love using the Corn Flake crumbs for anything that needs breading as it has a nice flavor even without spices and makes food extra crispy with just a very small amount of olive oil in the pan! Great on fish, twice baked ravioli and chicken to name a few. I have also used the crumbs in yogurt and on salads for a little extra crunch. Highly recommended!"
1,"This is my favorite breading for seafood, poultry, onion rings, etc.<br />To me, it comes out much more crispy and flavorful. It tastes more clean and natural.<br />It doesn't get soggy easily like regular crumbs from bread, it just doesn't seem to absorb all of the oil and lay limb.<br />If you like more crunch that allows the flavor on the inside to come through, this is just the right breading.<br />I also like to fry in this breading and then add to a pan of sauce and this coating still stays crunchy and crisp even through that."
0,"The only mint I taste is natural flavor, that's not mint. What's up with sugar and honey in it too. This make it too sweet. If I want sweet, I'll get the Southern style tea. Try some organic mint for a change and see the different."
0,"This was not a pasta salad kit as described. It is a kit for pasta stir-fry. Needless to say I was surprised and not very happy. I will use the pasta for something but, will not be ordering this product again."
0,"I bought these on a special sale. The mix is sour and in many of the sticks, the mix has clumped together so that it's very hard to get it to dissolve into water."
0,"Taste is sour- I use drink mix sticks every day and no matter how I mixed them, I just couldn't get them to taste good."
1,"This is not an over-the-top sugary drink mix like Kool-Aid, as others pointed out it is on the sour side.  While not what I was expecting at first I still find it to be a refreshing mix.  I have just received my second ""Subscribe and Save"" shipment of this the other week shortly before Amazon removed it from that service.  In the first shipment I had received there were a number of packets where the powder had solidified a bit as another reviewer reported.  I think I calculated about 18-20% of the packets in that shipment had that problem.  The only issue this gave me was getting the mix out of the packet; some alternate squeezing of the packet would break up the chunk enough to drop out into my water bottle.  It took a little longer to dissolve but then was fine.  In the most recent shipment all packets felt and sounded to be in loose powder form.  The only other complaint I have is that the packets never seemed to tear open well.  As a result I find it easier to cut them open with scissors, not a problem for me as I drink these in my office cubicle.  When this shipment runs out I intend to order a restock, hopefully it is available again at the SnS discount."
1,"I use this professionally and while it makes Ice Cream creamier, it also allows more air to be held in the finished Ice Cream, thus extending the time it stays frozen on the plate.  If you want to take your ice Cream to the next level, you need this product."
1,"Made icecream with and without it using same recipe. When I used Cremodan everything is creamier, so I blame this particular product for a better icecream in my case. Thanks a lot!"
0,The shipping from Amazon was great as usual.  However the product I received was not.  These truffles were almost past the expiration date and obviously had be stored in a non-climate controlled place.  The chocolate had been melted and the peanut butter nugat inside had melted down to blob in the bottom of the sphere.  These truffles were not a bargin at the price I paid for them. I will buy my next ones locally where I can be assured they will be what I am paying for and not something somebody is trying to get rid of.
0,I received my first box and when I opened it the chocolate had been melted. It was no longer smooth and creamy as Lindt truffles usually are. The weather had been cold and I accepted the package directly from the post women so I assumed it had arrived that way. I called Amazon and they gave me a replacement box which arrived in 2 days. Unfortunately it had also been melted and at that point I just gave up. I have two boxes of yucky chocolate.  I'm assuming that they melted while they sat around at amazon or Lindt provided a sub par product.  Do not order these. Buy them somewhere where you can inspect them first.
1,"Thank you so much for being a source for the Lindt Peanut Butter truffles!  Yes, the Hazelnut are amazing, but my favorite by far are the peanut butter and there are fewer and fewer stores that carry them.  I just received my box of 120 count and they are fresh and in the best condition.  They just melt in your mouth."
1,"This stuff is hot. You can use a third as much as you normally would and still end up with a hotter dish.  I don't know if it's so hot because it's fresher than what I've gotten in the grocery store or if it's because it's grown in different soil.  But, whatever it is, the product is both hot and flavorful."
1,Better than that stuff you get at the health food store.  Not sure why it's so better but IT IS. These 3 flavors go together really well. Getting compliments on everything I make. Going to buy more from Red Monkey soon.
1,This stuff tastes great!  I love that it is in glass bottles and not in plastic.  I highly recommend it.
1,"This is the good stuff because it is R E A L so buy it, you'll like it just as I did. By the way, the other juices of Lakewood are great, too."
1,"This is my third order of this pickled ginger.  After trying another brand sold here, I almost passed on this ginger.<br /><br />The pros:<br />+  This ginger is sliced thinly & there are no large pieces that need to cut before you can eat it.  I use my ginger on my tossed salad to add a bit of kick & sweetness to the dressing.<br />+  The flavor is smooth, sweet, slightly hot, but not overwhelming & there's no unpleasant aftertaste.<br />+  The shipment arrives very quickly & is very well packed. :)<br /><br />The cons:<br />-  This ginger is a bit on the expensive side, but in my opinion, well worth the extra cost."
1,This is an excellent product.  It is difficult to find this brand very many places.  The ginger has the right amount of bite and tastes like the finest available in the sushi restaurants.  I highly recommend this for people who love pickled ginger.
0,I was furious when I found out the ingredients listed on the webpage are different from the product's true ingredients and it is  way different!  ASPARTAME is in this product and YUCK YUCK YUCK. I am so sorry I ordered this and even sorrier I believed the Amazon webpage. I wish they would correct this!
0,"There are two Velveeta pasta and cheese dinners. This one, and Kraft Velveeta Original Shells & Cheese, 12 oz. They both use packets of cheese sauce, not packets of powder.<br /><br />But sadly, this one's not that good. It's salty, and the tiny bits of broccoli are few and far between. And with all the sodium (1230 mg per serving compared to 940 mg for the regular Shells and Cheese), it's a long way from healthy.<br /><br />Shells and Cheese is better. It's pure, creamy comfort food that goes down smooth and leaves no aftertaste. The pasta's ridged-shell shape makes every bite taste good, as dribbles of cheese seep into each piece and stick to its sides. It's much better than the broccoli version... and way more yummy (if more expensive) than the regular <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HUI0"">Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Supermac & Cheese Pasta and Sauce, 6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)</a>."
1,I love Velveeta and I love the rotini and cheese; I have had it before but it is hard to find in the grocery stores I shop at...I found it not to be as good as I remembered....the broccoli was minimal at best.
0,"Tastes good because, well, it's Velveeta.  But if you're buying it for the broccoli, don't bother.  The tsp of dried broccoli included in the package hardly makes it ""with broccoli""."
1,"I came across this product in the store in the form of those little 2oz cups that Easy mac comes in (I don't know if it's 2 oz exactly but it's the small single serving cups that you can put in the microwave). I liked it so much I came to my best friend Amazon to see if I could buy more and was pleasantly surprised when I found that you could buy it in the larger size. Obviously there are no health benefits and the broccoli comes dried in a little packet so there's not much to be expected, but if you like Velveeta and broccoli give this a try! I love it. It's quick and easy and difficult to find in a store so this is the place to get it. It's everything you love about traditional Velveeta with the fun twisty rotini pasta and broccoli parts. Very happy."
1,"these people are crazy I haven't met a person who didn't like this stuff, but it is about a dollar overpriced PER BOX on amazon.com"
1,I received my order quickly and the exp date was far in advance!<br /><br />The only con: packaging...some bags crushed as there were no plastic air bags to prevent crushing..carton flimsy.<br /><br />Warning: these r addictive LOL!!!
1,Very easy to order.  This product is not offered in most retail stores but readily available online.  One thing that I would like to have seen on the product description is a reminder that this product is perishable and has an expiration date.  This should be known to the consumer but I wasn't thinking about that when I purchased it early in December for a Christmas present.  I would have waited a few more weeks.
1,"This is A good product and it is good but can do with LESS SALT than it has, God bless."
1,I started eating chilicheese corn chips out of the vending machine when I was a young soldier in the Army. They were Delicious back then and they are Delicious today.
1,This is our favorite chip and the single serving bags help to keep the kids for wasting them.  They are good for those times when you have to grab something on the run.  I keep a couple of bags in my car for the kids.
1,Nothing has changed over the years: They were great 35 years ago and still are!
1,"Knowing these types of snacks are unhealthy has me in a state of guilt, to purchase.<br />I hope they will soon have an organic variation. Cheetos, and Lays do!"
0,i ordered the product on 8/29/09 and received it on 9/3/09.  64 single serve bags.  I was very pleased until i noticed the freshness expiration date on the bags was 10/6/09... way too soon compared to snack items that i would have found in a grocery store on 9/3/09. i doubt that i will order food products from amazon again... what a disappointment.
1,"Big sporting events. . .I'm into them all.  Super Bowl.  BCS Championship.  March Madness.  NBA Finals.  The World Series.  Pay-Per-View Boxing.  Wimbledon. . . .not.  And when you're watching a bigtime sporting event, you need a bigtime snack with taste and crunch and texture to hold its own in all the excitement.  You need a bag (or more) of FRITOS CORN CHIPS.<br /><br />Just something about the original corn chip and sports.  They go together like bacon and eggs. . .salt and pepper. . .Ginger and Mary Ann.  Could be because FRITOS CORN CHIPS go great with brewskies--or pile them on top of a steaming bowl of chili.  Mmmm, now you're talkin' Super Meal.  And for dipping, nothing beats Fritos Scoopers (not available here, alas) into a bowl of Lay's Creamy Ranch Dip (also, alas, not available here).<br /><br />So bring on the playoffs; usher in the buzzer beaters; welcome the wild card.  As long as you have FRITOS CORN CHIPS, it's all good.  Your taste buds will score.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq."
0,I got 100 bags at Sams Club for 16$......only hours after I placed this order for 62 bags at 42$ish. No way to cancel...next time I will pay closer attention to the fine print. Bottom line...these were. 56 per bag compared to Sams@ .18 per bag. Its hard to find multiple same chip bags do I just went for it. Haste makes waste.
1,Great variety.  Didn't have to go out searching and got all the flavors I was looking for at a great price.  My daughter is very happy with her easy and inexpensive summer treat.
1,"I guess kids will eat just about anything, I don't know if I would like anything like this, but the kids sure did eat it up..."
1,I've tried all the different flavors of bars that Fiber One offers and these are definitely my favorite. The caramel flavor is light and sweet and the fiber in these bars (a whopping 9g!) makes them a very filling snack or a quick meal on the go! I typically enjoy these in the afternoon to carry me through between lunch and dinner but have eaten them for breakfast on occasion as well and they keep me satisfied until lunch. Fiber is one of the hardest things for me to get enough of (25-35g is recommended daily) and these bars definitely help! Some people have reported digestive upset when eating these but I've never had a problem with them. I highly recommend this product!
1,"I am always on the look out for high-end flavored coffee (I mean, Starbucks doesn't even offer it-insert raspberry here)!<br /><br />This coffee is Ultra cinnamony! And I put a dried cinnamon stick in the coffee pot to spice it up even more. Not one of those pallid cinnamon flavored combinations with hazelnut or some such dilluter.<br /><br />So terrific, I ordered FIVE pounds from Red Buffalo directly after my first brewed cup! I cannot wait to taste all their other infused flavors."
1,I've ordered this three winters in a row and we love it. Our house wouldn't smell like christmas with out it.  There other flavors are great also.  Thanks!!
0,"My husband loves cinnamon and I have tried, time and again, to find good cinnamon coffee...He does not like the flavoring liquid; he wants it in the coffee..So we tried this and it was terrible...it's very strong coffee with an almost non existent cinnamon flavor (which is what I paid for)..I would definitely not buy this again...very disappointed...why is it so hard to get this kind of coffee....."
0,Just received my bags of yellow split peas.  The bags are 14 oz. bags and NOT 16 oz. bags as advertised.  I needed exactly 32 oz. for my soup recipe and now I am short.  I am returning the item for a full credit. Will shop elsewhere.
1,"The product consists of an approximately 10 inch (25 cm) long piece of meat with 1 or 2 smaller (approx 1 1/2-2 inches, 3-5 cm) pieces thrown in.  The meat is about 1/4 inch (6-7 mm) thick and comes in a fairly easy, peel open package.  Taste is good though on the salty side (it carries more than 1/2 the daily recommended amount of salt).  It does not actually taste like steak, just jerky, but the meat is pretty tender and I didn't feel like I was wrestling with shoe leather.  I appreciate the fact that the pepper bits are not ""loose"" like some other jerkies, so crumbs are not much of a concern.

1,"...in that it's chewy, beefy, and has a long shelf life. Jack Link's Peppered jerky is a tad too peppery for my liking, so I expected the teriyaki flavor to be just as robust. Instead, it is mild. Still really good, however! One word of caution, although it's addictive, eat in moderation, or your sodium levels will be off the chart."
1,"I find the Jack Links Teriyaki Beef Steaks excellent in taste and loaded with protein without a lot of fat nor a lot of carbohydrates, and excellent choice for camping, trips etc. the price thru Amazon can not be beat.  I am very satisfied."
1,"I love Jack Links Beef Steaks. These have a wonderful flavor with just the right blend of spices and hickory flavoring. I have trouble eating just one. It makes a great snack anytime. Before letting my grandkids know I have some, I make sure I hide a few first. Kids love them too."
1,"this is the only kind of peppered beef steak i buy.it's always very fresh.and taste better than the other brands,if you like jerky i would recomend this product."
0,"finished half of one steak, the other half dropped on my desk, so i picked it up, saw those nasty white mold on it. makes me sick.<br /><br />i've seen other reviews saying it had mold issues, i didn't really take it serious since i lovED it.<br /><br />now i see the problem, not over due, not under the sun, not in high temperature.  white mold.<br /><br />just found out this today,  i usually don't write reviews. but this is really really..  i can't think about it anymore. just..<br /><br />try not to buy it, or just buy the ones in 7-11  at least u can see it b4 u buy it."
0,"When I bought this item the first time, I was happy then I ""subscribed and saved"". What a waste! Once they have their hooks in you, they give you the bottom of the barrel. I even gave them a second try the next month and they were all moldy AGAIN. Terrible company. ""Subscribe and save"" users should form a class action lawsuit like done against Netflix when they gave new subscribers the latest movies, leaving the old B movies to the long term customers. Shame on Jack Links. Pathetic."
0,"I bought 2 boxes of these at the same time thinking I was getting a better deal than buying from the gas station. The first few I ate I didn't have any problems with. Since then, they either have mold or have been so hard that I cannot take a first bite through it (sidenote: I am an avid carnivore). They need to step up their quality control before selling this."
0,"After trying the teriyaki flavor of these beef steaks, I decided I would try another flavor so I ordered these peppered ones.  The flavor is really like throwing a salt and pepper shaker into your mouth.  You never really get a chance to taste the meat since your tongue is overwhelmed by this cloyingly salty, stale pepper flavor.  The worst part? There is 1470mg of Sodium in a single package, which is a whopping 61% of your daily value of sodium for the ENTIRE day."
1,This is a sooo much better snack than crackers or chips.  I have blood sugar issues and a protein snack is just what I need.  I also quit smoking in Jan. 2007 and am still smoke free thanks to Jack Links 2 oz. Original Beef Steak.  I honestly love them.
1,These jerky packs are great.  They actually do fill you up or at least stop the grum bellies.  I stay away from all the products that are just different ways of eating sugar and corn syrup.  I have a boy with ADD and I don't have him on drugs so it is very nice to have a great tasting and filling snack that isn't just sugar with flavoring.  Since sugar and corn syrup are major contributors to that condition.  Keep up the good work Jack Link.
0,"Just after one bite, I could really tell there was way too much salt in the jerky.  After two bites, I simply couldn't eat more.<br />Nutrition Fact says one serving's Sodium Content is 1540mg - 64% of daily value.<br />I would not recommend this jerky unless you already know what it taste like."
1,"This was a great product, shipped quickly and was hassle free. I will consider buying this on a regular basis."
1,Healthy treat for dogs and grandchildren.  I use them for training both.  Good behavior merits a Jack Link.  Give them a try.
1,"This is a greasy product, but has good flavor.  The meat is soft, not too salty, and meaty.  I would buy again."
0,"The Pepper Beef Steak is way too salty and tough.  It's a shame they don't put the nutrition facts on the packaging, but I guess that's intentional, because if I knew, I wouldn't not have purchased.<br /><br />Very disappointed."
0,Have seen mold on a couple of different flavors of this jerky.  I keep it in a cool dry place and it doesn't expire for another year.<br /><br />I've had it in the gas station before and it's fine.  But the couple boxes I ordered from amazon had ones with mold on them. I personally like this jerky but molding product gets a 1 star review.
1,"The product came quickly, one was great, but one of the boxes was dry and at the end of the pull date.<br />Thanks<br />Mike"
1,"Have order three boxes in total now. I bring one as a snack to work almost everyday. Soooo much cheaper to order from Amazon than to buy at a gas station. Some reviews say they've had 'moldy' packages. So far I've only had one single package that tasted a little off. The rest of the box was fine. Some jerky strips will have a bit of congealed grease on them, I just wipe it off. Perhaps those folks with the 'moldy' packages were mistaking grease for mold? I will continue to buy this product from Amazon and will always have a box on hand in my pantry. (Oh, of note, these strips are made from WHOLE strips of beef, not the ""chipped, chopped, pressed and pattied"" variety, and it is very lean. Lots of protein and only 70 calories a package. 'Beats a package of potato chips any day! They are a tad salty, but so are potato chips - and I always have something to wash them down with too!)"
0,"I was pretty disappointed with this. It's incredibly dry, to the point of being almost crumbly in your mouth. I also thought the flavor itself could have been better.  I've made jerky myself that tastes much better than this."
0,"I subscribed and saved to this kind of jerky in the past, then had the subscription canceled for a time. Since jerky is more expensive by the piece, I recently restarted the subscription... only to cancel it after the second shipment. It's nasty. I got two boxes of it and don't know what to do with it. It's old, moldy and disgusting. I am very disappointed with this product and recommend people avoid this until the company steps up and improves the quality. It may be a better deal to buy it in quantity, but it's not when you can't even eat it."
0,"Product not what is in stores, low quality. Taste and quality varies greatly between items in package. Stay away form these. Teriaki is plastic like and has a chemical taste"
0,"I do like how these taste but there is too much dietary salt. I also found that after eating two, I began to get stomach knots."
0,These things are terrible.  They have a waxy coating and some sort of chemical on top.  The taste of the chemical is very prominent.  I can't even give these things away.
1,These are perfect for my bf and myself. They are perfect size for a snack or for myself I have sugar issues so this is a good source of protein when my sugar is getting low. For the price and when you do the subscribe and save it is even better. They work great on the go or just when you need a quick snack and the flavor is tasty!
0,Over and over again I keep finding rotten or stinking beef steak in each carton . The quality control is very poor at Jack Link's
1,"The best jerky I've found for a low price. I'd rather have the organic/free range/etc jerky but am a poor grad student, so this stuff works for me. The best deal I can find for jerky anywhere is here on Amazon.<br /><br />They are so easy to carry around and are very filling. Sometimes they are a little tougher than others, but it's not so bad you'll rip your teeth out eating them. I only have 2 complaints - a ridiculous amount of sodium and a few other additives (like SUGAR) that I'd prefer not to be eating. But still... so good for what you pay for."
0,I bought 2 Jack Link's Beef Steak pack of 12. One of the two packs was open and had only 11 Beef Steaks. Also the meat is very tough to chew unlike when you buy from grocery stores.
0,"This jerky is; tough, fat, has gristle, and does not taste like teriyaki. They do not even try to make it with the right flavorings. If you like teriyaki get another product."
1,"I order this for my office and everyone seems to love it. After much taste testing, we chose Jack Links for the great taste, variety, and value."
1,"I picked one of these up at a convenience store for a snack. It was just the right amount for a mid-meal bite. I bought a whole box from Amazon to keep in the office. Other reviewers said that they thought these were too salty, or old. The box I received wasn't old, and as for salty - it's beef jerky stuff, what do you expect? Calories and fat content aren't bad either."
1,"I have not yet purchased this product FROM amazon, BUT as soon as my box from the Jack Link's Site is gone I will forever buy it from Amazon alone! This (Jack Link's ORINGINAL Beef Steak) is my absolute FAVORITE jerky and has been for years! I've spent way to much time and gas looking for it at near-by stores only to be disapointed and settling for either Jack Link's other products or O'Boy Oberto which are both fine, but for me it does NOTHING for my beef jerky cravings! It is true it is quite salty but what good beef jerky isn't???? My husband a fitness/gym nut LOVES this jerky as well as the high protein content! I also LOVE the extremly low fat content as I cannot stand chewing on leather or fat that never chews away! This product is not only healthy (aside from salt), filling, great tasting, and a great snack thats easy to eat it is also CHEAP! At least in my perspective! On Amazon it is an amazing $10.00+ cheaper (when including shipping cost) than the same box from the Jack Link's website(kicking myself in the butt for that)! I will absolutely be setting up auto shipping for this product!"
1,"It's tough to rate a food item as everyone has their own tastes. However, I think when it comes to store bought beef jerky, Jack Link's is about as good as they come. Most companies add a ton of extra garbage to their jerky, including sugar. You'll sometimes find 8-10 grams of sugar in some other brands. But with Jack Link's you are getting only 2 grams, and a taste that is comparable. And while all jerky is high in sodium, I realized these are a bit less than most competitors.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this is just good beef jerky without all the hoopla. A perfect healthy snack for someone in need of a little extra protein during the day. It won't beat the stuff coming direct from a butcher, but it's better than most of the other one's you'll find at a convenient store."
1,"Much happier with this product when purchased through Amazon. Meat appears older, less fresh when bought in the store."
1,"It's a nice price for a good jerky.  I try to keep loaded up on protein, and these jerkys are easy to just have lying around in case I feel like having one.  They taste pretty good, they're very low in carbohydrates and fat...<br /><br />But they're too salty.  I don't mean in a ""Gee that's more than the Surgeon General recommends"" kind of way, but in a disgusting kind of way.  Maybe if you have a really high tolerance for salt it's no problem, but I think most people would agree...anyway I get the Teriyaki flavor, with 440 mg of salt per oz.  The Pepper and the original flavors, at 770 per oz, are just too salty for me to want to eat.<br /><br />Amazon also has like alligator and elk and duck jerkey for sale...think I might give those a try once I run through this box."
1,"I really like this jerkey because it's not too spicy, has a good meaty texture and taste and it's the right size snack for me.  These boxed sets are a good price and I don't have to spend time running to the store and paying extra for them."
1,"I am in search of a good jerky and just had to try these.  I guess I paid little attention to the label ""Beef Steak"" versus beef jerky.  These pieces are thick and chewy and very peppery (in the original flavor).  I [personally find that I have more of an affinity to the regular, thinner sliced jerky over these ""beef steaks"" ... but we bought two boxes and are certainly enjoying them.<br /><br />These 2-ounce packs are filling, packed with protein and provide a great mid-day energy boost.  They travel well and the Jack Links brand has not let us down.  With so many varieties, we will be trying more.  These were a pleasant surprise and were different.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this is a thicker cut, 2 oz packs have 1280 mgs of sodium per serving.  Quite a lot!  Also, keep a toothpick or dental floss nearby, you'll need it!<br /><br />Very enjoyable nonetheless."
1,"The Jack Link's Beef Steak, Peppered are always nice to have in the pocket in case I get a bit hungry"
0,"I've picked up the smaller size at convenience stores and have always liked them.  I read some of the reviews and one person mentioned how very salty they were, but I bought this pack of 12 anyway.  I thought maybe he was just a little sensitive, but, wow, he was right!  I like the flavor, but cannot eat much of it at once. I eat only a small amount each time and close the package back up.  The small ones I get in the convenience stores don't seem this salty."
1,"We all know Jack Link's is an excellent product. Dates were excellent and you will never find a better price anywhere so go ahead sign up for autoship and enjoy healthy protein anytime.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GW0U3E"">Jack Link's Beef Steak, Teriyaki, 2-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>"
1,"This is big!  It's about a foot long and they has a pretty good girth to it (that's what she said)!  It's not as soft as normal jerky you find in the bag - I think this stuff is made differently.  It's tough and salty (that's what she said).  It's not the best tasting Jerky I've ever had, but for the price it definitely exceeds my expectations.  I've tried the Oberto brand jerky sticks and they were not very good at all.  And with 23g of protein and only 2g of fat in each stick it's pretty good for you!  One stick is pretty much a meal, though.  I find myself working on it for about 30 minutes before I down it all (that's what she said).<br /><br />Goodnight everybody - i'll be in town all week!"
1,The shipping charge was free and the transaction was smooth and quick. the product is fresh and easy to order. will order again and recommend.
1,"I've ordered this before and enjoy it, however wish it didn't have so much sodium."
1,peppered beef steak tastes better than other flavors offered by Jack Links......i actually have only tried the kc bar-b-q. but the other reviews say this flavor tastes the best.
0,Ive never tried kc bar-b-q so i didnt know what it was going to taste like. When i finally got it i took one bite and eewwwww not the greatest taste.......not like any bar-b-q ive tasted. Jack links should take this beef steak off the market.......maybe ok for older people that cant tolerate hot food.....my older friend really liked it so i gave it to him. try the peppered beef steak by jack links its the best by far.
1,I really liked the peppered flavor of the beef steaks.........i have yet to try them all but i hear peppered is the best flavor. spicey as far as pepper goes and tender. somethings you cant find in stores so i like shopping with amazon there great too.
0,The taste on these are just not right and what I was expecting. I thought it would taste just like the bagged jerky but its not. I would stay clear and stick with the bagged jerky.
1,"Do U like BBQ beef snacks??? Then buy this one, I think you'll love it."
1,"I've tried the hickory and peppered so figured I'd try the cajun too since I like spicy food. It has a nice kick to it but it's not too hot, at least in my opinion. The spicy taste lingers in your mouth for a bit but it's not a hot burn. It's not as tasty as I'd like but overall it's good and I'll order it again. My favorite is the peppered though, great taste and just a little spice from the pepper."
1,"wow the taste in this is great,very good flavor.very fresh tasting.i cut this in small pieces, for my kids.my whole  family enjoys the chewy beef steak,i will buy again.great for on the road trips.a quick snack."
1,Not greasy like the typical gas station or convienence store sticks. These are meaty and very tasty. The 2 oz packs are a great size for a snack. The sodium level is a bit high but they are defitnetly one of the better beef jerky sticks available. I bought both the peppered and the hickory but I like the peppered better.
1,These were pretty good but the 2 oz ones taste better. Maybe I just got a bad box of these though. still great protein and energy.
1,"I like the peppered flavor a lot better than the original or plain, it does have a good cracked pepper flavor. I also think the quality is better than most other brands that I have tried. I like the 1 oz. packages and great value compared to buying individually."
1,"I like the quality of Jack Link products, this one is more sweet than hot to me, just a little hot. But overall the flavor is good. The price is very good compared to individual prices."
1,"I like the peppered flavor a lot better than the original or plain, it does have a good cracked pepper flavor. I also think the quality is better than most other brands that I have tried. I prefer the 1 oz. packaged."
1,"This product is pretty good. With 26 or 27 grams of protien and low in fat, it is great for gym enthusiasts or people who want to stay healthy by eating healthy. I personally am a body builder and I'm looking to eat as much protien as possible everday. I definatly noticed an upgrade in performance in the gym and during the day when I take this. Although the cajun flavor is a tade too spicy for me at times. Like my eyes will get red and my nose will start to run. Other than that it is delicous. I will probably try the Teriyaki next."
1,I'd definitely recommend this beef jerky to anyone. I'm buying this again for sure. They are high in protein and low in fat. Don't buy the garbage quality slim jims or another brand. Get these
0,"Even though these are in sealed, individual packages, which is nice, it seems like they don't retain there freshness. A few of the sticks got like shoe leather and had little taste. I would not purchase them again. I think they should have more flavor since they are vaccummed sealed for freshness. Also the sticks get very hard."
1,"Have never seen this in the stores, my favorite is Peppered but also ordered this at the same time.  Was glad I did.  Very good flavor, kind of spicy ""after the fact"".  Love the single serving packs so you don't eat too much and great source of protien!"
1,"If you like cracked pepper this is definitely good eats.  Not too overpowering, it's just right!"
1,"Awesome flavor, great texture, just the right amount of pepper to give you a great tingle to the taste buds.  Definitely one of the best.  It is real steak.  Highly recommended!"
1,"Great tasting jerky. Nice, thick, moist texture tears and chews easily. 1 oz size is a perfect hight protein, low fat snack. Sodium content isnt too outrageous either."
1,I love Jack Links Beef Steak and this has to top them all. I only ordered 1 box and will definately order more. I very highly recommend the peppered beef steak. A perfect blend of pepper and spices with a smoked flavor make this a great anytime snack.
1,"Hickory is one of the top flavors when we asked US troops what they like.  They love the steak strips as they are a bit softer but very satisfying.  If being able to carry along a snack, and needing protein is part of your decision, this flavor in a steak strip cannot be beat !  You won't go wrong on this item."
1,"Good quality jerky.  Not too hard.  Taste like real meat.  A little hot for my taste, so I gave it 4 stars.  I would get the plain.  It's pretty spicy."
1,"Good brand.  They must pay their sales people a lot tho.  I saw these in stores for at least 50% more and convenience stores.... well, who has a wheelbarrow that big to haul around their change in?<br /><br />Send a lot of Jacks Link's steak strips and jerky to the American GIs in the Sand and found ordering it this way to be much more pliable and easier on your jaw than the same brand in Mart type or warehouse membership stores. If you send any to the heat like that, this is a much better product so there's a little time allowed to still have decent jerky arrive.  Steak strips and jerky are better liked than the nuggets tho.."
1,I have a border collie and my husband started to give our dog a jacks beef steak every night as a treat. Now I buy boxes of 24 all the time and the vet says they are better to give then a raw hide or some of the treats in the stores .So I think they are ok in my book. Hard to find 1oz ones sometimes but they are worth the price.
1,I'll give Jack Links 4.5 stars on flavor and quality but a much lower rating on bulk pricing.  I order quite a bit of beef jerky online in larger quantities from many vendors.  To keep fresh remember to store this in a cool environment.  The 2 ounce package is a perfect portion size.
0,"I usually buy the Sweet&Hot jerky strips at Walmart and love the taste. I decided to try the 2oz stick from Amazon and was disappointed for 3 reasons:<br /><br />1. They came with expiration date only 48 days away. I've bought a couple of grocery items from amazon and this seems to be a common pattern. I've also read reviews complaining about the expiration issue on other Amazon grocery products. I love shopping from Amazon, but this reason alone may stop me from buying perishables from them again.<br /><br />2. These sticks are not nearly as soft in texture as the strips. Maybe it's because it's almost reached its expiration date?<br /><br />3. The flavor is not exactly the same as the strips. It tastes more or less the same as regular beef jerky. A bit of hot (as most jerkies are), but not much sweet. Again, is age a factor?<br /><br />I've tried many brands and flavors, and Jack Link's Sweet&Hot is by far my favorite. Get it in strips.. and get it from you local grocer."
0,I would recommend to stick with the bagged beef jerky. I bought these because I thought it would be much easier to transport with me on the go like road trips but the taste is way off compared to the bagged jerky and I didnt care for it. Very dissapointed in the taste.
0,"I thought this was similar to the Jack Links Peppered Beef Jerky, boy was I wrong.  This stuff is like eating pure SALT.  Nasty as hell.  One package serving is 57% of your recommended daily intake of Sodium.  This is one of the highest content of sodium I've found in Beef Jerky.  I don't recommend this unless you really really like SALT."
1,"This Customer is quick about sending out their product, this is the 2nd order of jerky I have received and will be ordering again in the near future.  Thanks"
1,"This tea is easily one of the best in Davidson's line. An intoxicating blend of rich cherry and scrumptious almond, this tea also has the honey note that makes it sweet at brewing. The scent alone is enough to make anyone smile, but the taste is perfection at any temperature. I've tried it from very hot to using it in iced tea and I am delighted with the results every time.<br /><br />Highly recommended!"
1,"I've been GF for two years, and have tried several different brands of mixes, flours, and prepared foods. Nothing has even come close to how amazingly delicious these are. I added cinnamon and cardamom, and vanilla extract, but they would taste just as good plain. My daughter really missed having sand tarts, as they are her favorite cookie. She was in absolute heaven at her first hesistant nibble...she's a very picky eater, but she loves these.<br /><br />On the Bob's Red Mill site, they have recipes for variations such as snickerdoodles, and directions for how to use this mix as the basis for a cookie ""cake"".<br /><br />I highly suggest trying these, but be aware that they are meltaway soft, so they won't ship well. Be sure to follow the directions on the bag. I thought the dough was too crumbly and was about to add more butter, until I read the instructions. It is a dry, crumbly dough until you mix it by hand. Also, definitely cool them on a wire rack, otherwise condensation will ruin them.<br /><br />These can easily pass for a ""regular"" cookie...no one will guess they are GF!"
0,Only good thing about these cookies were the lightness and just alittle bit of a sugar taste. Call for a good amount of work in doing these cookies. Not that impressed with the texture of the cookie. Wish it was better in this area.
1,"Our daughter's school always has a gingerbread booth as part of their annual fundraiser and we wanted to offer a gluten free version for the kiddies, like our daughter, who can't have gluten.<br /><br />I figured this mix would be a great base to start with, as shortbread cookies are crunchy and often cut with a cookie cutter into a special shape. It did work great for gingerbread cookies with just a few modifications on our end.<br /><br />We followed the instructions exactly except that we used 1 whole egg, a 2nd yolk, and saved the extra egg white if the mix seemed too dry (it will indeed be dry as the instructions say, but if it's so dry that it flakes apart when trying to move it to the cookie sheet, absolutely add more egg white!) We then added an extra tsp of vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to alter the flavor to be more like gingerbreads. You can add powdered ginger if you want, however, our daughter prefers this milder ""spice"" recipe than when we add ginger, so we didn't use any.<br /><br />There was tons of positive feedback about the GF gingerbread cookies from both Gluten free folks and regular people - the recipe was a great success! We also thought they were incredibly tasty.<br /><br />Tip: ABSOLUTELY use the parchment paper when making these cookies! put it as a liner on the cookie sheet, also use it to roll out the dough on and also as a layer between the dough and the rolling pin. It made a huge difference! I've also heard that if you refrigerate the dough for an hour before rolling it out that it works better - we didn't try this though.<br /><br />So! whether you want to make G.F. shaped cookies for Halloween, the winter holidays, or whatever, this is a great mix to adapt!<br /><br />Happy Gluten Free Baking!"
1,"I love this cookie mix.  I add in a handful of pecans and they are like the gluten filled ""pecan sandies"" that I used to eat.  Easy to make and so good."
1,"Even if you aren't GF, this is an amazing cookie mix!  It is very crumbly when first mixed, but when you work it together with your hands is forms a ball that can be (very carefully) rolled out.  While getting the cookies cut and to the pan may be challenging (from simple bumps causing the uncooked cookie to break), once cooked and cooled (absolutely use a cooling rack), these are a wonderful treat.  Buttery, flaky, mouth watering shortbread."
1,"All I have to say is my husband didn't know that the shortbread cookies I made with this mix were gluten-free. That should say it all!<br /><br />Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Shortbread Cookie Mix is awesome.  This cookie mix has great taste and very easy to make.  Snip the bag, pour into the bowl, add a few other ingredients and they are ready to bake.  Although I did cheat and make them as ""pan cookies,"" they turned out great! They are great with fresh fruit and a little chocolate syrup on top or with ice cream."
1,"My title says it all.  I made 2 trays of cookies - 1 GF and 1 standard because there were folks from both sides of the isle attending.  I added ground, toasted walnuts to the shortbread mix and, to my surprise, they were the first to vanish.  I had GF folks argue that they had to have wheat in them because the are just so good!  Nope, just an outstanding product<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NLZZCM"">Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Shortbread Cookie Mix, 21-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a>"
1,I was so happy to find these after eating at a German restaurant and sampling spaetzle noodles.  These work well in many dishes from soups to casseroles and the size of the box is (9 ounces)is a good size for two people.  Delicious and a Great Product!
1,"Some time ago I ran out of chicken-flavored bouillon cubes and the store had none. However, they had 7.9 ounce jars of same. Well, I'd never tried the jars before but why not? As it turned out, I preferred the jar to the cubes. Well, next I was out of beef bouillon cubes and ran into the same problem. Same solution too. I bought the 7.9 ounce jar. It's excellent. Just yesterday I made a beef-flavored soup/stew and used the bouillon as a flavoring agent. Everything turned out perfect. This stuff has a real high sodium content, so I eliminated salt as an ingredient. The result was excellent!<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
1,This container is medium size but I like the size and it was convient for my to purchase this item because I could only find small container at the local grocery store.  I love to cook with beef flavored bouillon so it was a great purchase for me.
1,The item arrived quickly and as described.  The recipes included  in the box are great! Better than the recipes I originally intended to use.
1,"Junket brand rennet is a must have for lower fat and no egg ice cream recipes. It is necessary for that old-fashioned-homemade taste, highly recommended."
1,"There is a nice mix of sizes, small and round or larger oblong, just like how the root looks. It is nice and meaty in the middle with some pieces having that very strong ""bite"" of hotness that ginger has. The crystalized sugar lightly coating the ginger helps take the zing out. I use this for cooking, stomach soother, or unique treat."
1,"Tender and spicy crystallized ginger. It seemed a little expensive with the shipping--next time I'll get the 5lb box, I think that had prime shipping available--but this was well worth it. I used it in a molasses cookie recipe and it made some incredible cookies! Some of it may have been eaten straight from the bag during the cookie-making process and it was yummy on its own too."
1,"A bit pricey but since this is a hard item for me to find in grocery stores, its worth it to me.  Fast delivery and very delicious."
0,"Didnt help with the smell of my dog at all left her white even after brushing her plus it made a mess trying to get it on her,would not buy it again a waste of money."
1,"Ever since I came to know about this at Whole Foods, I have been purchasing it either from store or online. This gum does not hold for a long time and so it is an automatic reminder to spit it out before it dissolves."
1,"I have been chewing Peelu gum for many years and I really love it. The quality of the gum has always been consistently good when I buy it at Whole Foods and Mrs. Greens. I bought some online, not from an Amazon dealer, and the quality was not as good. So I can highly recommend this product when purchased from Whole Foods and Mrs. Greens. I love the peppermint and the spearmint flavors and the cinnamon is nice too. I really like that it doesn't have aspartame/nutrisweet (and all it's other names like phenylketuronics) as that gives me headaches. I also like that I can buy it in bottles of 100 or 300. It is a good product."
0,I'm an avid gum chewing person who has been trying to switch over to natural sugar free gum.  Initially I purchased this product due to the price being cheaper than it's main competitor spry.  What a mistake that was.  Actually this product is no cheaper after you spend 4.99 on shipping and also count in the additional time you have to wait for the product (4 -5 days) to be delivered.  The product tastes great initially but after about 5 minutes of chewing it tastes like crap. It leaves a very nasty after taste in your mouth. I'm forcing myself to chew it so I don't feel like I've wasted my money but it's not worth it.  The Spry gum tastes soooooo much better and it lasts.  Also I've tasted the variety of Spry flavors and they are all good.  So my final recommendation is to save your money on this product if taste matters. If it doesn't matter and cleaning you teeth is the key issue then go right ahead and torture yourself.
0,"This gum is not worth the money.  There are far better Xylitol products out there for sale.  This gum's taste lasts less than one minute before it is spent and tastes like an old shoe.  Additionally, about the time that the flavor goes bad the gum turns to mush and does not even resemble gum at all.<br /><br />Most Xylitol gums that I have tried to not last that long but this one by far is the quickest to go south.<br /><br />I have had much better luck with others, you probably will as well."
1,"Wonderful.  We have been looking for a recipe for Mulligatawny soup for years and this is by far the best we have rasted  Just add a little chopped chicken and rice, and it is perfect.."
1,"I first had instant whole dried milk when doing missionary work down in Honduras, CA. That dried milk happened to be either KLIM, a Borden product, or Nido, a Nestle's product. For all you dyslectics, you probably picked up on KLIM is just MILK spelled backwards......LOL.  I have had whole milk in the UK and even their full cream Jersey, gold topped, milk and thought that might be the best milk ever.  Matter of fact, I grew up in Houston, Texas and raised on a local dairy milk, Westmoreland.  During those days the very best milk was the one that was the creamiest and Westmoreland guaranteed that, as all their milk was from Jersey herds.  Peak easily surpasses that great ""fresh"" milk.  Not only does Peak taste great, not dried/instant, but it has the greatest milk taste ever.  I dare say that as long as I can order this stuff, I will never buy ""fresh"" milk ever again.  I am no longer a frequent milk consumer, but I do use it to make yogurt occasionally, on cereal, or even drink it, but rarely buy it as it typically goes bad/off before it is consumed.  Frankly, I do use it every morning in my coffee or tea.  I would recommend that it is made in a blender, chilled overnight, and then consumed.  I also have used half Peak and Sanalac powder to achieve a lower fat, but full flavored milk."
1,"I tried this based on my mother-in-law's recommendation. This milk powder is nothing like the nonfat milk powder that they sell at most grocery stores. You know what I'm talking about--the kind that tastes like powdered milk. Blech. This one is so rich and delicious. You have to use a lot of it to make a single glass, so it doesn't last very long. This is also great to keep at the office to use in your coffee where it's not always practical to keep a carton of milk.<br /><br />I can't emphasize enough how good this milk is.  This may sound strangely random, but when I first made a glass, I noticed my dogs intensely staring at me, hoping I'd give them some.  So I did.  They absolutely love it, too. They reacted to it as if it were the most delicious thing in the world.  They don't even react that way to steak. My husband even noticed and commented it's like doggie crack. I've never seen anything like it.<br /><br />It's also nice that you can control the richness of it by adding more or less powder.  I also tried the Nestle Nido milk powder that I got as a sample, and it is just as good."
1,"This product is suprisingly delicious. Unlike the instant non-fat milk that I am familiar with, this product tastes exactly like milk on cereal, in coffee/tea and from the glass. Rich and creamy."
1,"Homogenization and ultra-pasteurizing having ruined milk as a healthy product, we have long searched for a tasty powdered milk substitute. This product has superior flavor and is easily mixed into either cold or hot water. The container is a tin and has a tightly-sealing cap to ensure freshness."
1,I have only used Carnation or generic instant milk before. awful stuff. this product is excellent. I added it to oatmeal while it was cooking vs plain water and I was very pleased. I USED IT FOR MY ELDERLY MOMS COFFEE VS USING NON NUTRITIOUS COFFEE CREAMER.  Looking forward to trying it other ways but at this point I can forsee me ordering it again. I have now started using it in canned cream soups for my elderly mom. i fill the empty can with desired amount of water and then add the Peak.  and the best part because i use non fat or skim for myself....THERE IS NEVER ANY SPOILED OR WASTED MILK OR YOU NEVER HAVE TO GO WITHOUT MILK.
1,"I was looking for milk for my coffee that I could keep at work unrefrigerated and was planning on purchasing those little creamer cups. After reading reviews on Amazon for Peak, I decided to try it. This is not like instant milk of old. It is a very smooth and wonderful powder that easily stirs into a cup of coffee. So much better than  coffee-mate type powders."
1,"This is great for those that don't drink milk on the regular. This way your milk won't go bad, and you always have delicious milk on hand when you need it. It is really sweet, so if you don't like sweet, just add more water. It comes out creamy when you mix according to the instructions. Good packaging, doesn't get stale, and I usually keep it for about 4 months. Great purchase, and I have Amazon Prime, so it came quick."
1,"I ordered this with several uses in mind, and keep finding more as I get more creative! I do not buy milk because I just don't drink it, however, this powder is the best tasting milk I have had since I was a kid! I decided that CoffeeMate is just alot of chemicals, so each morning I put a tablespoon or so of this into my coffee and it is heavenly!! It has vitamin A and D too! Any recipe that calls for milk, I just make the milk using Peak instant milk powder and water and presto! So convenient and it mixes in a snap. My latest kick is to make a milkshake (moderately low calorie) in a blender using the Peak milk powder, a few packs of Splenda, some water and ice and either some fruit or cocoa powder and a splash of vanilla! Delicious treat for under 150 calories. Satisfies that sweet/creamy craving I get. I used to eat ice cream and now I do this and I have kept off those extra 20 lbs. I lost without depriving myself of something I enjoy. This is so much better than the diet ice creams they sell at the grocery store, and no chemical additives! I cannot say enough good about this product. I highly recommend!"
1,"We have tried several different brands of powdered milk recently to see which is the best for food storage.  This is very good tasting milk according to my husband - very creamy.  My ratio is different than the directions on the can as I did not want 3.5% milk fat.  I mixed 1/3 c. powder with 2 c. water (or 2 1/2 level Tbsp per cup water).  This probably made a very creamy 2% milk - more or less.  The directions on the can call for 3 heaping Tbsp. to about 6 oz. water to make 6.75 oz.  That's not even a full cup.  The can will make 3.5 gallons (about 56 cups of milk) using my ratio above so that equals $4.95 per gallon or $4.70 with subscribe and save option.  Not so bad considering.  However, if you use the ratios on the can it can be very expensive."
1,"I was skeptical when I was reading reviews but this stuff is awesome!! I don't drink much milk (mostly put it in coffee or cook with it) so the convenience of being able to make just as much as I need and not have to waste half a carton of milk is very nice. But more than that, this stuff actually tastes good. Not quite as good as Organic Valley fresh organic whole milk but definately as good as any regular whole milk or even Horizon whole milk. After you mix it up, it even coats the glass in the same way as fresh whole milk. But its powder, and instant. It tastes nothing like that nasty powder skim milk at all... it just tastes like good milk. It dissolves easily in warm water with nothing more than a quick stir. I haven't tried stirring it into cold water (the instructions say to use warm water) but I imagine it would take a bit more stirring. Anyways, I will definitely be purchasing this again. I have been searching for a brand of powdered milk to make  homemade instant cocoa and I think this may be the perfect thing."
1,"I wanted to replace my old stand by Nido with this brand.  It tastes great, with no smell found in the Nido product, but the price...  This brand is about double what you pay for Nido!<br /><br />On price alone, I had to take a star away."
1,I went to Africa and when we were leaving made sure to bring back 2 Peak containers home.  We ran out and I knew that i must replace it immediately.  I went to the Caribbean stores ad they had it on say for $20.  Checked on Amazon and it was $12.  Perfect price!  I no longer need to buy from overseas.
1,"My parents took us to live in Nigeria in the eighties and one thing we missed at first was having a glass of ice cold milk after school. That is,until my Dad came home from the university he was teaching at with a huge tin of Peak Milk,given to him  by a colleague who'd heard of our yearnings. It was perfect. For one serving ,just dissolve 2 heaping tablespoons of the powder in two ounces of water, mix thoroughly to get any lumps out then top up with another six to eight ounces of water, either hot or cold, depending on how rich you like it. Peak milk and Klim ( a similar product by Borden)were life-savers in Nigeria at a period in the nation's history when electricity was a luxury rather than a take-for-granted amenity.<br /><br />* It is a splendid pantry item in areas where power is spotty and you can't keep things refrigerated for long;<br />* With the rest of my family on vacation(without me,*whine*),I find that I may not always be able to use up the container of milk before it starts going south so this is great if you find that happening to you a lot. (I need sour milk for several of my chocolate cake recipes,but there's only so many brownies a girl can bake when the rest of the family is out of town...);<br />* It works wonderfully for baking and yogurt making. Just reconstitute according to package directions and carry on;<br />* One strange thing I noticed: like many adults of African ancestry I began to develop lactose intolerance as I grew older but I find that unless you are truly allergic, drinking reconstituted dried milk somehow has no ill effects on ""the pipes"". Go figure.<br />* You will find Peak milk in powdered and evaporated forms(better than Carnation by me)in most African and Spanish stores,in varying sizes. The size offered here is the Granddaddy and great bang for your buck."
1,"My wife only drinks powdered milk. She only had powdered milk in China although never as good as ""Peak"". Drink it hot or cold. Some vitamins and minerals. Best in a blender with ice. Also use it as a base for protein shakes."
1,"This product has a great taste, but it doesn't quite have a regular milk taste. Nor does it taste like normal powdered milk. It has a unique pleasant taste of it's own..<br /><br />However, for a heavenly unique taste, mix up a glass of this milk and add some ""Pappy's Sassafras."" Add your favorite sweetener. This drank is truly great."
1,"I bought this for my mother who is allergic to milk.  She loves it.  She said it mixes well in both cold and hot water (unlike supermarket powdered milk which doesn't mix well in cold water).  She said the taste is great and she enjoys it on cereal, in her coffee and for cooking.  Highly recommend this!"
1,"I was surprised when this peak powder came,I found many uses for it,It is great used as coffee cream,it is a lot like Pream from the 50/60s.I will be ordering it from Amazon from now on,my daughter and grand kids take some home everytime they visit."
1,"I bought 2 dried milks. Peaks dry Whole Milk and Now foods Non Fat Dry Milk. Peaks dissolves instantly even in hot coffee, Now Foods does not, makes a complete mess.  Bought it for making fresh Mozzarella Cheese. Haven't got around to making the cheese, need more ingredients. Wish they made Non Fat Dry Milk too."
1,Thanks.<br /><br />They have a product dried cream on amazon.  I forget the make.  I'm going to order it and review it.
1,Peak blew away my expectations... I had tried powdered milk before. Never have I had milk taste this good. I use it as a staple in my diet and never worry about spoilage. Great for your survival stash. Highly recommend.
1,"Almost tastes like ""farm fresh"" milk. A defined departure from the usual preconception of powdered milk. Has ""texture"" like red cap vitamin D milk."
1,This is better than the crappy 2% they make us drink. Who needs 2% milk when you can get 100%(joke). It also last's for a while.
0,"I purchased this product because I wanted a powdered full fat cream substitute for baking and cooking on my low carb diet  ( full fat cream has zero carbs). However, when the product arrived, it was DRY WHOLE MILK which has 8 grams of carbs per 3 tbsp!  It has a decent taste and arrived as promised, but I would have never purchased dry whole milk... The product title is misleading....."
1,"A puppy training book I read recommended these treats and they work great.  My pug loves these treats and will do most anything to get a reward.  I also use the leftover ""dust"" to sprinkle on his food when he isn't finishing his meal."
1,"These are the only treats my apricot toy poodle will eat.  She loves them, and will do all kinds of tricks for them.  They are organic and healthy, too."
0,I found this item under puppy treats at Amazon.  When I received it there was a warning on the back that said for adult dogs only.
1,I am a diabetic and this is my one treat that gets rid of a craving for something else. I love these smaller cans--so perfect and so fresh and tasty. Packed with care and delivered as usual--on time. I love them---
1,"Product is wonderful. Real stainless steel. Easy to use.<br />Should last a life time. Mesh is very fine, great for tiny leaf."
1,"I like these Pomi tomatoes because they are fresh and flavorful.  Also, they come in a carton that is a welcome alternative to metal cans which impart flavor and which sometimes are lined with a plastic containing Bisphenol-A."
1,"Compared to any brand tomato product, Pomi has less sodium, all natural ingredients and excellent taste.  Look at any can of 'reduced sodium' tomatoes and Pomi is significantly better."
1,"I discovered Pomi many years ago.  There are always a couple of boxes of this staple in my pantry.  I love the taste of the Pomi tomatoes in my Italian dishes.  You get 100% percent Italian tomatoes and nothing more.  There is something unique about these tomatoes.  Vegetables taste different depending on the regional soil in which they are grown.  Apparently, the Italian soil does something magical for tomatoes.  I much prefer Pomi tomatoes over the locally grown tomatoes.  There is no comparison."
1,"Just found these in our local store. Taste just as good as other chips, and my kids love them.great way to get nutrients and not feel so guilty about snacks."
1,"Bought this as a joke to give to a friend that is a beer connisseur (sp) for his dog. The dog didn't really care one way or the other and tried to give some to my dog and he also turned up his nose. Not sure, but it appears to have a very salty, brothy smell that could be the reason for the turned up doggy noses. However, it was cute to put into staged pictures of the dogs with the plastic bottles looking like they were hung over, along with their master!"
1,"I just mixed a little of this with his dog food and he loved it, just make sure you know your dog is going to eat it in one sitting or else you will have to waste whatever you mixed."
1,50 lbs. for $22.00 + free shipping is a pretty good deal these days. The nuggets are smaller & have different shapes which is good for my 3 small dogs. It smells beefy. I mix Moist & Meaty with it & they seem to like it so far. My 2 larger dogs like to take a mouthful from the bowl & bring it in the TV room & pick on it. That's a good sign they won't be turning up their noses. I like the High Protein factor too. Even a couple of my cats have nibbled on it a bit because of the smaller mixed pieces.
1,"The Dog was great, it took a long, long time to arrive and when it did finally get here, the bag was ripped at the top from the shipper. And I did post that info back to the company with No response"
1,"I have tried alot of asparagus, these are by far the best, enjoyed the garlic and spices in a lightly pickled variety. Excellant in Bloody Mary or all by themselves. This Vendor has the job done just right. I also highly recommend the brussel sprouts even for those who think they don't like brussel sprouts!! 5 Stars to this winner.."
1,"What a fantastic deal on bulk order of spice...be prepared to share with many friends and family though unless you have a restaurant, this is a lot of spices!! Great quality!"
1,This product was a gift for my staff because we are going to Costa Rica.  It was a fun gift and taste good as well.  Great value.  The box it was shipped in was damaged but the bottles were all fine.
1,"We add soy nuts to trail mix, salads, rice cracker mix, and anywhere one could use a peanut.  This is a great deal.  Buying small packs at the local store is expensive.  This supply should last us a year or so.  Thanks!"
0,"AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!!! I ordered a dozen bags of soy nuts, and when they arrived, the presence of nuts, salt, and misc. debris in the bottom of the box should have been a dead giveaway. Fully HALF the bags were not properly sealed along the bottom edge, and as a result of course the contents were not protected as they should have been from the outside dirt and germs and whatever other crap was floating around as they were shipped and delivered. Half the order, straight into the trash. And of course I feel less than 100% confident of the other half, given the slipshod inattention to proper packaging of items intended for human consumption.<br /><br />""Melissa"" -- this is a FOOD product! Hello? You think you might actually like to SEAL the containers that contain the food????"
0,Half of the bags in case did not get sealed at the bottom of the bags so they spilled out all over the inside of the box. Notified the company weeks ago and they have done nothing.
1,"Love the zip lok bags.  Nuts were not salted, lacked the hulls that help provide fiber and additional vitamins.  Nuts were tasty and fresh, I freeze the bags until I need the next one.  When including shipping, these are the best value of several sources I have found since Trader Joes stopped selling them."
1,"The product is ok.  It is half ""nuts"" rather then the full ones I have gotten in other brands.  I ordered salted and got plain."
0,I had ordered the salted soy nuts but the non-salted soy nuts were shipped instead. I certainly would have prefered the salted soy nuts that I had ordered.
0,"I can't review the product since I did not receive what I ordered.  This is the second time I have ordered Melissa's Soy Nuts, Salted and this is the second time I received the ""no salt added"" Soy Nuts.

1,"You see, my Wholefoods used to sell these in the tubes and cards, but now, they only sell them in the cards! Thus, I had to retreat to the internet to purchase them in the tube. I decided to be economical and purchase the 600 count of Spry gum as well. So after I run out of gum in my 30-count tube, I refill it with gum from my 600 count. They are inexpensive, aspartame-free, and good-tasting - which is enough to be 5 stars for me. Though, I wish they tasted stronger and didn't run out of flavor quickly."
1,"I love Spry gum. It doesn't taste too strong, it doesn't stick to dental work, and it supposedly is good for your teeth.  You can get a giant jar and refill this little container for your car or purse."
1,"It's the perfect amount of chocolate.  Maybe the other person who reviewed this got a bad box, because I thought they tasted great, especially the raspberry and the orange."
1,These jelly bellys are just so good! They made gourmet jelly beans &uuml;ber gourmet! I love the dark chocolate with the raspberry and the orange too. I consider them fine candy -- high enough quality to put in my artisan-made candy dish in my office.
0,"i got this (dark chocolate) from my mom for easter, and being 22, im grateful for any present i get at my age. but this candy...i dont know..it just tastes funky. i tried all the flavors and none of them taste like the fruit its supposed to taste like; cherry and chocolate does have a slight sweet chery taste, but it only lasts for a split second and this is the only one that has a taste even remotly close to the fruit taste. the coconut one also has a fruity-ness to it, but coconut shouldnt be fruity... i love Jelly Belly jelly beans and i love chocolate and the idea of this candy is fantastic, however, they need to taste good....right??? i figure it had to be common sense but nothing about this is good..not even the chocolate tastes like chocolate. major fail on this product."
1,"I love Decaf Cafe Verona, especially in whole bean.  It's definitely one of my favorite roasts.  It's a nice dark roast, but sweet and cocoa-ey.  I like this roast with dessert or in the evening.  The beans are nice and oily and fresh every time.  I highly recommend this roast!"
1,"Whole bean Decaf Verona is a strong decaf that I blend 50/50 with either Italian or French Roast whole beans (usually French).  This blend makes a robust, richly flavored cup of coffee."
0,"Out of the four blends of Starbucks coffee I have purchased and tried, this is by far the worst. Super bitter with a complementary disgusting after taste."
1,"This is our favorite dressing!  It stays mixed, and the dijon is just spicy enough but not too spicy.  The flavor of the tarragon with it is delicous!  You should try it!"
1,"I usually pick this up (every bottle available)when I see it at Home Goods or TJ Maxx but, it's so hit or miss. Sometimes I can grab 4 or 5 and sometimes it goes for months where there are none.<br />I'm hoping more people will catch on to how great this vinegar is, popularity will grow and I'll be able to grab it at the local Stop & Shop. I't so good that I'll search & buy on the internet when I can't find it and I don't do that for just any condiment.<br />This is great in any dish calling for red wine vinegar. If you think you don't like red wine vinegar, it's because you've been using such substandard brands (progresso - ewww!! and don't EVER buy the store brand!) that you don't know what red wine vinegar shoud be.<br />You should be able to taste the wine. It should not be watery in the least. It should make you happy!<br />I cook with this on a regular basis. I'm basting cornish game hens with this vinegar right now (Mud Hen in a Mud Pack from Barbara Byfiend's The Eating In Bed Cookbook copyright 1962)and I use it when I make my sausages in red cabbage [...]"
1,"I love the taste of Tabasco. Love it! However, I'm a wimp. It's too hot for me to use to the degree I'd like to use it and still maintain my dignity. Well, that's where Trappey's Red Devil Cayenne Pepper Sauce comes in. For those of us who love the ""taste"" of the heat, but not so much of the heat itself, or those of us who can't eat jalapenos or habaneros whole from the plant, or those if us who just want a little spice, this is the perfect condiment. It does have heat, don't misunderstand me. Your nose will run and maybe even yours eyes a bit, but, it's not so hot that you really can't enjoy it. I put this on chili, mac and cheese, pizza, chicken wings, and on and on. For me, Trappey's Red Devil Cayenne Pepper Sauce is one of the perfect foods around."
1,We have recently switched to decaf and were buying Starbucks' decaf espresso beans.  They were good but prettyexpensive and weren't organic.  We saw these and the price was much better PLUS they were organic.  We didn't have high expectations because usually you get what you pay for.  We were pleasantly surprised!  The beans are very smooth w/ an excellent flavor!  Due to this we're almost out again and will definitely be buying more.
1,"Crispy crunchy and a delicate bite that chomps back if you nibble too many, these beans are perfect for pairing up with your Ceaser instead of a stick of celery. Hard to find in the area of California i reside in, i was excited to find a supplier that was able to ship so quickly and serve my cravings for an item so readily available back home in canada"
1,"My dog LOVES this chew bone, is highly disappointed if I run out. She generally chews one each evening, and has been doing so for at least 1 1/2 years without ill effects. It is sort of expensive, and occasionally I try to substitute, but she gives me this guilt-inducing stare, may grudgingly take the substitute which she then may not finish. My vet recently commented that my dog's teeth looked great for a dog of her age - 9yrs."
0,"Warning to dog owners! This product has caused many dogs, including mine, diarrhea, vomiting, and seizures.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />My history with this product:<br /><br />My dog was very ill for 3 days: violent diarrhea and vomiting. Called vet after first day, they instructed me to keep him on a bland diet, and to bring him in if this persisted more than 3 days. Luckily, he got better and I didn't have to take him in. I thought, maybe it's just my dog and he has a sensitive stomach?<br /><br />I went to the web to research the product and found others had experienced the same thing. So I wondered...why is this product still on the market? I contacted Purina, and after no luck with them (who claimed they never heard of any complaints), I contacted the FDA, which currently has this product under surveillance.<br /><br />By the way, my dog is not a toy breed, he's a 20 lb. mutt. So say what you want to say about the latest 'not meant for toy breed' disclaimer on the package, he doesn't fall into that category.<br /><br />Sure, some dogs can tolerate this treat, but why take a chance on your pet's health and life?"
0,This treat has given my 120 pound doberman seizures and diarrhea badly. He is shaking all over and can barely walk as his hind legs are not wanting to stand. The muscles keep contracting. He finally vomited a lot of the bone.<br />I fed him one small busy bone. How can a company allow this to be sold?????????????<br /><br />The chemicals and colors in this treat are off the chart. PLEASE DO NOT FEED THIS TO YOUR DOG. I HAVE REPORTED IT TO PURINA AND THE FDA
1,"Everyone's tastes are different. But this is my absolute favorite olive oil. It has complexity, and has this incredible long smooth finish. I pour it over heirloom tomatos, or grilled asparagus, or just dip good bread into it!"
1,"Antara Olive Oil is wonderfully smooth.....like silk in your mouth.  The taste is pure olive oil.  I've tried many others, including in Italy,  and this is one of the best for the value."
1,This oil has got to be the best tasting oil I've ever tasted! Very addictive as a dip with good bread! Five stars! Love it!
1,This is by far my favorite olive and and it is excellent for dips and dressings!!!
1,"My enthusiasm for this product is mainly that I'm a Vegan and have used it as a supplement.  I believe it's only 2 tbs. for the serving and you get 45% of Iron for your recommended daily allowance which is phenomenal.  I haven't seen any other cocoa product in my experience with such a high percentage of iron except for chocolate bars coming close and of those, only the one's that really don't use filler or water down the product.  Look for ""cocoa mass"" in the ingredients list if you want the higher iron there by the way as well as a higher percentage.<br />All these compliments being said for the current time I would advise one not to order the product here as the shipping cost kills the value."
1,"Geewees, where do I start? First, I'd like to say that I have personally tried this Ojio brand, although I'm not a Verified Amazon Purchase and would recommend it over any other brand from all that I've tried, (The only one that comes close is Navitas Naturals). No, I do not work or represent the company but just wanted to share my opinion on a great product. The good thing is, the supplier sells direct through Amazon, so you don't have to worry about counterfeits or any funny business.<br /><br />Anyone can tell you that the main component for real chocolate is cacao powder. If you didn't know that, I bet your grandma did. We have this big misconception about chocolate and many of us have been raised to think that it is bad for you. This is mainly because of the high content of white sugars, synthetic sugars and dairy products that are in most chocolate candy. Whether dairy is beneficial for you is another subject all within itself and based on your personal research, understanding and belief system. The subject here is CACAO POWDER and although I am not vegan or on a 100% raw food diet, for many years now, I have been eating 50 to 70% raw food and cacao powder has been an invaluable ingredient to most of my homemade protein bars, carb bars and desserts. It is a fat burner, aphrodisiac, an energy booster (with low grade-slow caffeine release) and a great nutrient for the blood. This explains why women crave chocolate during their cycle. Check the internet, do your own research, it is remarkable. The most important thing is-- to consume it in combination with the right ingredients/foods that are healthy for you.<br /><br />Lastly, cacao powder contains a high volume of the amino-acid Arginine also known as L-Arginine (no other vegan source carries it in such high amounts next to rolled oats), which reduces healing time of injuries (particularly bone), quickens repair time of damaged tissue,  and helps decrease blood pressure. Most importantly, it is the precursor for the synthesis of ""Nitric Oxide"", a vessel dilator present in a lot of sex pill formulas and bodybuilder supplements. This is what helps men get that extra pump in every sense of the word! A scoop of this raw cacao powder should go into your daily protein drink and you can't go wrong. See all my reviews for more tips on male supplements."
1,I was hesitant on buying this organic cacao because of the 0 reviews but after seeing the nice packaging photo and visiting the company's website and finding out more info on the product I decided to purchase it. Initially I bought this organic cacao to prepare a facial mask from an online beauty recipe I found along with some other natural ingredients but was so impressed by the packaging (I'm a graphic designer hehe) and the little history on the back that I thought I'd give it a taste. It's definitely very rich tasting and very high quality. I'm not a cocoa drinking type person so I sprinkle a teaspoon of it to either my coffee or chai tea and I can immediately taste the richness of it.
1,"I've tried a lot of coconut oils and this is the best I've ever had! Why? It tastes amazing, for some reason it has a lighter taste, and it's cold pressed and extra virgin. I cook with it, eat it straight out of the jar, put it on my lips and face, and make yummy desserts with it. AND it's healthy!!!"
1,"This is a great cereal bar, and I'm suprised that it's not widely sold at grocery stores. I think it tastes far better than the Lucky Charms treats and much better than the Cinnamon Toast Crunch bars that are sold both which I think taste good as well. The Golden Grahams Treats though have a very distinct flavor, and the marshmallows and chocolate chips throughout it make it one of the richest tasting cereal bars I've ever had, and as a result does satisfy your hunger. I highly recommend this product to anyone that likes Golden Grahams, you will not be disappointed."
1,For some reason I woke up craving these and couldn't find any near my house so ordered a whole box. The price was great. And as soon as I ate one it brought me back to my child hood yummy!!!
1,This product is very good and Quaker is one of my favorite brands.  The single serving bars are wrapped in a light aluminum foil and shipped well in package plus carton. The flavors are yummy and at least two months on date when I received.
1,"This was a great find in the Warehouse Deals!  I was concerned I'd receive them and have a week til they expired, but they were a full 2 months ahead of the exp date and in my household they will be devoured by then!!"
1,"I have an office in an extremely remote and often frigid location and sometimes have co-workers visiting.  I try to make the workspace welcoming and hospitable.  I set out a box of other assorted teas and a box of this Numi assortment and visitors ALWAYS go straight for the Numi.  This also serves me well because I can pick out a tea to suit my mood, whatever the occasion.  All of the teas have great, deep flavor."
1,I ordered this collection in error but it was a nice error.  I have enjoyed the variety as it allowed me to try some different flavors.  I am still most fond of the Chocolate Pu-erh Tea.
1,"This is some of the best tea I have ever tasted! Love the variety as well, every tea bag is like a little surprise, and always delicious! A great purchase, immediately ordered a second after trying several of the tea bags."
0,"I love Numi's organic loose leaf jasmine green tea and drink it every day, so I figured I'd try this sampler to see if there were any other Numi teas that appealed to me.<br /><br />Honestly, I was disappointed.  Out of 18 different teas, the only one besides my favorite jasmine green that really appealed to me was the breakfast blend.  Maybe it was the fact that they were bags instead of loose tea, I don't know.  I just didn't like the flavors that much.<br /><br />However, the quality of the tea was decent for bagged tea.  It didn't seem like it had been sitting forever and getting stale.  Especially the floral teas, like the rose infused white tea, tasted fresh and the floral scent was vivid, but not overpowering.<br /><br />Also, it's a mix of herbal (no caffeine) and black/green/white (with caffeine) teas, if that's important to you."
1,"I was pleasantly surprised by the selection of this tea. Another review said there were 9 teas with two of each flavor but mine is just as described in the product description with 18 DIFFERENT TEAS!! Im thrilled to try so many of this brand of tea. Great selection! My only concern is that the scent of the teas mixes in the box, perhaps the individual wrapping should be another material? Overall, very satisfied!"
0,"I really liked this collection which I purchased it the first time about two years ago.  Given that I am already familiar with these teas, I made this purchase because the product description included two teas that I had not tried.  I thought this was a new collection with a combination of new and old products.  Turns out that it was the same 'old' collection and despite what was in the product description, this collection did not include the two teas that I had not tried.  I thought it may have been a shipping problem because the two teas are also listed amongst the ingredients on the box.  Sale or no sale, I am making my tea purchases in a store so that I will know what is in the box."
1,I bought this teas as an alternative to plain iced tea. Drop a single bag into a gallon jug of warm water and in about 30 minutes you have a oitcher of very flavorful and refreshing tea. Add a little sweetener and some ice and sit back and enjoy.
1,"Let me start by saying that I'm a lifelong tea drinker and I love tea, and I've tried all sorts.<br /><br />I started out years ago with Lipton's before all these different designer brands and flavors came along. Black Ceylon tea was what they called it. Then when all these designer brands and flavors came out I tried all the exotic flavors I could get my hands on, mango, vanilla, raspberry, chocoloate, peach, whatever. I tried different brands, I tried expensive teas, cheap teas, organic teas, the standards such as Earl Grey, Darjeeling, Assam, etc.<br /><br />Finally, I came back to this tea. It was like travelling around the world in a circle and coming back to the start. I love this tea because I've found all that other stuff, apple, peach, raspberry, just detracts from the true flavor of tea. This tea is just pure tea, without any other distracting flavors and that's what I love about it. A stong tea, a robust tea with full strong flavor, for a man (or a manly woman).<br /><br />When I make it just right, the right temperature, the right strength, this is what I imagine Homer's nectar of the gods to be like. It's like Zeus brews me a cup, hands it over and says ""here, drink this"".<br /><br />So far I have not been able to find another unadulterated tea with such a full and strong flavor. A 10/10."
1,"When  I could no longer drink coffee  ( I loved it but it stopped loving me at age 50, making my nerves too jangly and insomniac for comfort) my favorite advisor about coffee and tea suggested I try Taylor of Harrogate""s Kwazulu Tea from South Africa.  Enough caffeine to keep a busy evening nurse clear and running at San Francisco General Hospital, but no frazzled nerves, and deep sleep like a baby restorative rest once off duty.  i love the clean, slightly bitter taste it gives to my palate; other black teas taste insipid by comparison.  If you like English or Irish Breakfast Teas, you'll find Kwazulu Tea a magnificent improvement and frankly, never want to settle for anything less.  It's sometimes a little difficult to find, but like the search for the Holy Grail, worth the pursuit.  Shop around on the internet for the best price since there can be overpricing.<br />A sante, as Julia Child always signed off."
1,"I drink this tea everyday, you can say I am addicted to tea. This tea is what I call Real high quality tea from South Africa, not that Lipton stuff. It is rich and dark without being bitter. Best paired with sugar and milk, just like the English."
1,"This is a strong but not bitter tea, as others have mentioned. The thing that really distinguishes it is a rich tone like fresh-cut cherry wood in the middle of the flavor.  Keeps very well, smooth on the throat.  I can put a gram in a full cup, let settle,  and have a tasty dilute lunch tea that's more woody, or 3 grams per in a pot for something really rich, with sugar.  Takes less than other teas.  I've been raiding an office-mate's box, so the 6-pack of boxes will let me replenish that store and load up my own tins.<br /><br />9/24/2009 update:  An office mate had this and I loved it.  I ordered this 6 x 4.4 oz.  set, and at first taste, it was very different.  A lot more bitter, much less fresh woody flavor, more like a Ceylon.  I was surprised and disappointed.  The office mate noticed too.  She says it isn't even close. We made some, compared again.  The bits and the tea color look similar, but the flavor is way off, with a flat bitter note instead of the wood note.  Not sure what to do with this.  Many people like this, but it isn't the Taylor's/Kwazulu charm I got to like before.  Maybe I can add some wood chips from a wild fruit branch...I dunno.  Woe.<br /><br />The editing will NOT let me alter the rating stars.  I would give it: 2 stars now.  This is not what I was raving about before."
1,"This is an excellent black tea. My preference in black teas runs toward those that are smooth and not at all bitter. This means I often end up with  somewhat blander brews with little to distinguish them. This Ntingwe Kwazulu is a great exception to that experience. It's quite brisk, has robust flavor and yet is very smooth with no bitterness. My only complaint is the powder residue in the bottom of the cup, but it's well worth it. Now my favorite black tea!"
1,This is a very smooth loose leaf tea which tastes great in the morning. It's really good with 1/2 & 1/2! You need to brew it just right preferably in a bone china teapot! The best thing about it is that it is really well blended. I've been drinking it for years and highly recommend it!!!
1,Perfect cup of tea. The best tea I have had since leaving the UK to live in the US. Worth the effort to use leaves instead of a bag. It's become our daily drinker.
1,"Taylor's of Harrowgate South African Kwazulu Tea is the perfect tea for anyone trying to give up coffee.  I switched 22 years ago. Rarely, I still enjoy a really good cup clean interestingly blended, freshly ground coffee or<br />very occasionally, an expresso with lemon zest, but for the day to day morning dose of wake-me-up caffeine that doesn't jangle my Irish nerves or upset my tummy, it's Kwazulu Tea the is perfect for me.  Try it and see what you think.  M. Tealeaf, R.N. 65y.o. female"
1,"Drank this tea almost exclusively for about two years.  It brews up with a full body and thick liquor and an equally robust albeit smooth flavor.  This tea has a look peculiar to itself in that the leaves appear almost ball-like.  I don't know if this is the type of tea bush used in this variety or if it is a characteristic of the picking and curing process.<br />Anyway, I ceased drinking this tea about three years ago when the formula appears to have been changed with a consequent flavor change.  The tea now has a strong, and to me, unpleasant aftertaste that puts me in mind of something chemical.  Anyway, I don't like it and ceased buying this blend.  Before then, however, its robustness made me feel exactly how a Zulu Warrior must have felt as he went off to battle.<br />I believe that a reviewer below states he began drinking this as the next best thing to coffee and I wholeheartedly agree.  I too kicked around for a tea that came close to the strength of coffee before settling on this one.  Highly recommended to those who have to wean themselves off Java.<br />If you are looking for flavor, the loose leaf tea with I find the one with the most refined and complex flavor that is both robust and inexpensive is Ahmad Tea's English Breakfast tea.  I see it sold only in bags here on Amazon but it is definitely a superior everyday drinker."
1,"What can I say, I love these. Not too heavy, but filling at the same time. I used to get them straight from Poland, but that's no longer necessary."
1,Arrived shortly after ordering. They were good but they were stuck together and weren't as fresh as the ones at a grocery store. One of the few places to be able to get 5 pounds of gummy worms and for a fair price.
1,"Well, I didn't really think this tasted much like pumpkin.....But the chocolate around it was delicious!  I think I may just buy the plain chocolates next time!"
1,"You have got to try this! So nice to have freshly ground spices. I put this on everything hashbrowns, eggs, chicken breasts, taco meat just about anything. has a nice smokey flavor with minimal heat! Worth a try!"
1,"Being a person with Type 2 diabetes, I have to eat whole grains. Finding a flavorful whole wheat couscous is a boon.  This couscous does not taste like cardboard."
0,"Was looking forward to lovely whole wheat looking and tasting couscous, and got the same white bland tasting stuff I can buy at the local store for a whole lot less money."
1,"After much deliberation about wedding favors, I ended up going the edible route and bought the Leonidas chocolate favors from Amazon.  I highly recommend these for many reasons - one, they are yummy and go well with champagne; two, they are shipped fast and no hassles; three, it's super easy - you get a box of nicely wrapped favors and you can just take it to your reception and be done with it.  All in all, I was very happy with this choice!"
1,The product came well packaged in a Styrofoam box and each box had a nice orange bow on it. The price can't be beat. Much cheaper than Godiva and much better chocolate as well.
1,"We gave these as a gift, they are great you can't go wrong w/ Amazon.  Just make sure you don't leave them out in the warmth of the day or the chocolate might melt.<br />You should be home when deliver is made."
1,"My small dog loves his new food! Due to allergies, he only eats raw food.  This is by far the best and easiest food, preparation wise, that I've purchased thus far.  He devours every morsel, however, I do recommend mixing it with another food in order to prevent weight loss or increasing portion sizes.  At first, Ewee (he looks like an Ewok) lost a considerable amount of weight on this food, so I had to increase his portions to compensate.  Other than that I think it's a great, healthy product!  Oh yeah, and it lasts for at least a month."
1,"I wrote an extensive review of this brand for the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027IQC78"">Sojos Complete Turkey Dog Food Mix, 8 Pounds</a> and how it has improved my dog's life and helped her allergies. It is exactly the same for this product.<br /><br />However, my dogs MUCH prefer the beef flavor to the turkey. We try to switch between the two to give variety, but they eat the beef immediately and are much more excited when they are on the beef bag. The beef also looks different and has more distinguishable vegetables. However, as puppies we fed them vegetables as snack and they really like them, whereas my sister's dogs do not.<br /><br />My dogs love this dog food and I love how healthy and shiny it makes them and their coats. We will continue to purchase and love the convenience of Amazon."
1,This is Knorr's Hunter Sauce that you use to be able to buy in your local supermarket.  It is good and just what is needed to add that extra little something to your meal.<br /><br />It was shipped right away and arrived before the suggested delivery date.
1,"It doesn't matter who sells the Hunter Sauce (Jaeger Sosse), or what language is written on the package.  This sauce is perfect with mashed taters and pork chops.  According to the directions, one can use this sauce with steak and chicken; I don't doubt it.  I wish I could buy it here in Korea, but I can't.  Amazon makes buying stuff like this very convenient for me."
1,"I'm always on the lookout for something I can use as a quick breakfast or a relatively healthy dessert, so when I saw these on the shelf I figured that I had to give it a whirl.<br /><br />The good about this product is that it is only 160 calories, is pretty filling, has 40% of your daily vitamin C, & is awesome when heated. I decided to try mine heated as was recommended & I found that it didn't burn or taste funny, which is a huge bonus.<br /><br />The bad is that this isn't nearly as easy to open as the manufacturers would have you believe. The plastic wrap covering the apple portion didn't peel off cleanly & I ended up getting apple goop all over me. The other bad is that this has about as much sugar in it as a 3 Musketeers bar. I'll probably end up buying this again, but only sporadically as a treat. That's just a little too much sugar for my current diet.<br /><br />This does make for a filling meal, but if you're watching your sugar, looking for something to put in a bagged lunch, or wanting something a little more diet-friendly, I'd avoid this."
1,"This is absolutely awesome! OK, so it may have sugar, but with oatmeal and apples, you still can't go wrong. The flavor is oh, so fine. One caution: it's a little wait for it to cool down enough to eat, so please be careful. And one problem: the price is simply outrageous. It's awesome, but too doggone pricey. Bought mine at Sam's Club at an excellent price only to never see it on the shelves again which is downright sad. All the same, try it and enjoy!"
1,"I'm a life long vanilla lover and was thrilled to discover this product in my local market while I was living in Southern California. Now that I'm on the East coast, I've been unable to find it. As you might imagine, I was delighted to find it on Amazon. This product is sweet (without any sweetening additives) and the lovely vanilla flavor is rich and long-lasting.  It permeates and enriches whatever I have used it in. I recommend it most highly!"
1,"I discovered Orlando Vanilla a few years ago while spending a week in Puerto Vallarta. I am a chef and specialize in pastries so a good vanilla is important. I've tried Nielsen Massey vanillas and they are excellent but they still have a bit of a chemical/alcohol scent to them. McCormick extract (the most commonly found at your local supermarket) is so strong alcohol-wise that once you've had good vanilla you'll never go back to cheap chemical tasting junk.<br /><br />Orlando vanilla (and their other brand La Reyna) is strong, smells sweet with no chemical notes.  The aroma of vanilla permeates the kitchen when you use it. It is very reasonably priced and since most recipes call for about a teaspoon of vanilla you will find that an eight ounce bottle like this gives you enough for 48 typical recipes. Depending on your taste or the strength you are looking for you might get fewer or more portions.<br /><br />I buy mine from Puerto Vallarta when I go. I usually buy two liters (a liter is a bit more than a quart) and this year I have a tour of the factory scheduled. Kept in a cool, dark place vanilla extract has an extremely long shelf life so no need to worry about spoilage. I don't think you can go wrong using this extract. The only other way to get better flavor is to use good quality vanilla pods (see my review on those if you are interested)"
1,"I actually really liked this vanilla!  I truly didn't think I would, but it's quite fragrant with a bit of a sweet vanilla smell.  It's nice.  The only thing that would be great, is if it didn't come in a plastic bottle."
1,"Though I like all things potato, for the most part I enjoy potato chips sparingly because of their calories and fat content. In this case, however, I made an exception, intrigued by the ""Dirty"" name on the bag and the low price in the local warehouse store. A third reason I avoid potato chips is a lack of will power on my part, and I soon found out that controlling one's eating with an open bag of these chips nearby requires a will of steel. Mine is a will of mashed potatoes.<br /><br />Dirty chips are a taste bonanza and a sensory delight. They are thick and crispy with an intense flavor one can't get enough of. If you think about it, salt and pepper complement potatoes perfectly, even in chip form. Want a different potato chip experience, try these tasty tater treats."
1,These are the most awsome chips if you like black pepper as I  do you will love these you can tell the pepper is fresh ground it has a nice bite I will order again
1,"For fun, I went to the nutrition store tonight and bought about 2 dozen different protein/nutritio bars. My daughter and I decided we would do a taste test of each one so that we could buy the ones we liked in bulk off Amazon. It was a rather expensive endeavour, especially since we threw out over half of them after the first bite.<br /><br />Well, as you might imagine, there were quite a few BLECH! bars - virtually inedible. There were maybe a handful of bars that we deemed 'edible if really hungry and there were no other healthy options', and then there were about 3 that were really really tasty.<br /><br />NuGo Dark Chocolate Chocolate chip was pretty good.  Good chocolate flavor, texture crispy, not pasty.  190 calories seems high, but you do get 10g of protein with it.  I wouldn't call it delish, but how many protein/nutrition bars are really all that good? I prefer the Luna bars by far, but that's just me.<br /><br />I would not wretch to eat these, but I wouldn't be running out to buy a case of them either.  If I was hungry and there were no healthier options available, I would eat it, probably with a glass of milk, and it would tide me over until dinner."
1,"It tastes better than a balance bar, and its vegan.  It tastes more like normal chocolate than dark chocolate, I think.  It has enough sugar to almost put it in the candy bar category, but the protein is high enough to make it not too bad for you.  It works in a pinch when I need a small energy boost and cant eat a meal or healthy snack.<br /><br />If they could put some vegan sources of the common difficult vegan vitamins (B12, D, Iron, Zinc and Calcium) in this, I would consider it as a daily snack.  Until then, I consider it a nice indulgence."
1,"I had the pleasure of sampling this product earlier this week, and I have to say, of all the [anything other than pure chocolate] bars I've tried, this one had by far the best-tasting chocolate.<br /><br />Not a hint of the fake-chocolate taste that's so prevalent in other bars!  In fact, these nugo dark bars are so downright delicious that I'd likely pick them over most any packaged dessert choice.<br /><br />And indeed, these fall squarely into the dessert category, not health-food category.  In fact the only thing costing this a star is my wish that they had a bit less sugar and a bit more fiber (10g of protein is reasonable, IMHO, for a bar this size and of this deliciousness)."
0,"We bought these for my child who has anaphylaxis to nuts and dairy.  We get the product home to find out there is a shared equipment warning.  It says all preventative measures taken, etc. But if you're not comfortable giving your child shared equipment food you may want to know that up front. It would have been nice if they posted that part of the ingredient label on Amazon."
1,"Yes, it's packaged ramen, not a health food. However, for those who want a fast and inexpensive snack or meal, Maruchan ramen is a classic.  This Chili flavor can be hard to come by in some markets; I haven't found a reliable source locally for the past year or so.<br /><br />Some may mistakenly think that ""chili"" means Mexican-style, like the dish with tomatoes, beans, and beef. Here, ""chili"" means chili pepper, as in spicy broth. Don't pay extra for those bowl noodles with the additional spicy seasoning packet. Maruchan chili-flavored ramen gives you the same flavor and heat for less money and less wasteful packaging.<br /><br />This Chili flavor makes a great, spicy ramen with flavor and a little kick. You can enjoy it as a simple ramen soup or add meat and vegetables for a more nutritious and tasty meal. Give it a try!"
1,"Grocery stores are usually around 20 cents per package; however, the selection is less than stellar for Nissin and Maruchan. Amazon's price is sometimes a little higher, but considering there's a better selection of Maruchan than I can find elsewhere, it is definitely well worth it. I can't even find the Maruchan Chili [Pepper] in grocery stores (though I can sometimes find the Nissin of the chili pepper flavor in stores). I got these Chili Pepper noodles on Amazon for around 25 cents each.<br /><br />The Maruchan chili is a bit more spicy and tastes different than the Nissin chili noodles. I'd say I like both equally well. No matter which flavor, they're a bit too salty. I sometimes will use one seasoning packet with one noodle package, because it tastes so good, but once in awhile I'll use half of the seasoning packet for one noodle package. I usually eat two noodle packages, so I just put in one seasoning packet. I put in about half of the suggested water in the frying pan to cook the noodles and all the water simmers away with no water leftover. I add the seasoning packet at the very end of cooking, so the flavor of the seasoning is still prominent, even with half the suggested seasoning.<br /><br />I like the noodles in various ways. I sometimes will add one or two eggs while cooking the noodles. Other times, I'll mix in a half cup of mixed frozen vegetables while it cooks."
1,"I am life long ramen noodle fan and I put red pepper in mine before cooking.  I have never seen these in the store.  They are awesome!  Nice and spicy too, don't need to add the red pepper.  They are not chili flavored, more chili pepper flavored."
0,Hate the way manufacturers hide BEEF Extract in-between all the other garbage ingredients.<br />They need to be more forthcoming with the advent of so many people going vegan
1,"BTW, I'm eating the Chili flavored Ramen as I'm typing this, lol :)<br /><br />Creamy Chicken used to be my favorite until I came across this Chili flavored.<br /><br />I am not a big lover on spicy foods but boy, these are amazing :D<br /><br />Just enough hotness to make my face a little hot but that doesn't stop me from digging into a bowl of these yummy ramen noodles!<br /><br />Flavor is perfect!<br /><br />But they are spicy enough that you do need a drink next to your bowl, lol<br /><br />Try these! Soooo good!"
1,"I always get the chicken flavored Ramen noodles, which I loove. This week I got a pack of these to try and they are great! True, they do not taste like chili, but I knew not to expect that after I read the reviews. These are red pepper kind of spicy and they really have a kick to them. The seasoning package seems to be bigger than in the regular chicken ones and unless you want your mouth to be on fire, you can easily use only about half of the packet and it still tastes great but not overwhelming."
1,"I love picante sauce in ramen, these are very similar to that.  Be careful though and slowly add the seasoning pack and taste as go.  Its very spicy and delicious."
1,"24 pack for $6 is simply amazing<br />i stopped buying nong shim after the price went up from $16 to $20 before SS<br />this brand doesn't taste very well in most cases, but the chili one, is very nice, comparable to the spicy nong shim."
1,"It's ok-but almost too spicy for my taste. It's really spicy with a touch of lime flavor. It's very different than the chicken flavor,and for the cost,worth it."
1,These noodles are great really spicy but not overpowering for me. I usually add some vegetable like peas and carrot. I would definitely buy again .I was not able to find it in any of the local grocery stores.
1,"These noodles are very good, but for me there not hot enough.<br />Other than that there good !! Don't taste very much like chilly?"
1,"About time someone made something that hot means Hot and has some heat! I eat chicken wings all the time and I would say the heat is equal to my favorite level of chicken wing heat ""HOT"". The flavor is spot on with what it is called ""Chili"" like the bottle you have in your cabinet to make homemade red chili, but has the heat of cayenne peppers. It has good robust flavor that lingers after your done eating.<br /><br />I wish they would put this seasoning in a bottle so I could sprinkle it on everything I eat. They should do this with all their flavors!!!"
1,The price of ramen on this site is ridiculous. I found this one for $5.28 so I bought it but other wise I would definitely go back to buying from another online site that has better prices than the grocery stores. I remember when ramen was cheap. Other than that it's exactly the same quality as in the grocery stores.
1,I tried the plain mix and it left an empty feeling for the flavor. I mixed the product with other soups and noodles and this was a very good way to add a little spice to other things. Amazon has the best varity of these products.
1,"These are my favorite flavor of Maruchan ramen noodles. Keep in mind that these are not at all intended to taste like American chili. These are chili flavored, as in chili peppers--a spicy flavor. They are reat for lunches at work, though low in nutritional content, they are super-cheap. Eat one package with half the seasoning packet and a daily multi-vitamin and you're set! So many people at my work order fast food every day for lunch. You'll save hundreds of dollars by trying these noodles instead. Rotate them with other tasty, inexpensive meals and you have a great, economical solution to daily lunches."
1,The ramen noodles that were sent to me were awesome. My fiance loves them just as much as I do. And none of the packages were damaged in any sort of way. Im definitely buying them this way. We couldn't find them ANYWHERE in the stores... so I checked on Amazon. Thankfully they had them. Thanks Amazon...
1,"When it says chili, it means tastes hot and has some chili-ish flavor. But mostly just some spice. This is what I expected but just clarifying. It's an interesting ramen compared to the others, which tend to be meat flavored. I love it, and I'm sure anyone who likes hot stuff will. Even if you don't, its not very hot at all. I might try the picante chicken though (chicken + hot) to see how that tastes.<br /><br />By the way, this tastes amazing if you add some sriracha sauce!"
1,"Chili-flavored Ramen? I was hesitant to order, let alone even try this flavor of Ramen noodles. But I figured for the low price, why not?<br /><br />The noodles itself are noodles but it's the flavor packet that makes all the difference. The chili flavor isn't too bad at all. I now prefer it over the several other Ramen flavors I've tried. The level of spiciness is perfect and I am (actually) happy with this purchase. So much so that I ordered another 24 packs of it."
0,"I am a big ramen fan and seeing this pack on sale, I picked it up as a low cost gamble. But the chili flavor is pretty horrible. The broth basically tastes [and smells] like taco seasoning. I would not buy this again."
1,"I was pleasantly surprised at the spice in this flavor of ramen. All I had tried up to this point was chicken and beef, so the chili flavor was a nice change. I recommend ... so long as you like spicy dishes!"
1,"I highly recommend to have business with this company. I like their job. Nice price, quick shipping, tasty product."
1,This spinach fettucini is the best we've tasted.  There is also a recipe on the back of the bag that's fantastic.
1,"This is the same pasta which sells for considerably more at Whole Foods, Smiths and some Albertson's. This tastes like the pasta you would be served in an upscale Italian restaurant. Since it is made from spinach (but sure doesn't test like an spinach I've had)it is very healthy and simple to make. Add your favorite sauce, or some fresh tomatoes, and a glass of wine and you will be sitting down to a very nice meal with a minimum of effort. For a change try adding some chicken, soy , meatballs or fresh vegetables."
1,"Here in SW Florida, I find it difficult to locate spinach pastas.  I've now ordered this pasta at least several times and I'm always more than satisfied...with the quality, the taste, the cost.  What I especially like is the cooking time.  This pasta seems to be ready for serving in about two-thirds the time other pasta takes.  Ordering in quantities of six allows me to also share a bag or two or three with friends."
1,The Al Dente Spinach Fettuccine is the best ever - in fact have subscribed to monthly Amazon deliveries
1,"Great product.  so good in my casseroles.. the family also loves them , they are yummy and will order more soon."
1,"Well worth the money, especially on auto-ship. Absolutely a great value, not to mention tasty and delicious! Would definitely purchase again."
1,"Excellent product.  My family loves it and I am providing them with the nutrients they need.  I did not realize I was getting 6 bags in one shipment, but they are easy to store and I usually cook one bag for my family of four.  I then have leftovers for work the next day."
1,"The price is certainly right! I purchased because it came up in a search for ""vegan"" products. This pasta is NOT vegan -- it contains egg white. If that is not a problem for you, by all means purchase. It is fine in every other respect."
1,This pasta is easy to make; fast cooking; and tastes great. The packaging is terrible if you don't use all of the pasta and need to reseal.
1,"The pasta is fine, tastes very good and the package is plenty for 5-6 people.  The problems I have are A) one of the bags arrived with a tear and some of the pasta was spilled inside the box and B) package says cooks in 3 minutes but that is NOT true. It takes about 10 minutes unless you like your pasta REALLY firm. The quick cooking was a major part of the reason I made this purchase so that, combined with the torn bag are the reasons I won't purchase again."
0,"I did not purchase this juice here at Amazon.Com as it is 51.00 and Walmart had the identical product for 15.00. (NOTE:) Right after I wrote this review I contacted Walmart with my review- they chose not to print any part of my review;however, Walmart did change their price to 50.00 the following day.<br /><br />Continuing with product review: Please read for your own health:<br /><br />The juice tastes good (does not taste natural) and is thicker than normal for Pineapple and Coconut juice. Now, as any juice drinker will tell you both pineapple and coconut juice have a very thin water-like consistency.

1,"If you love sweet relish with some heat (not mustard relish), then this is the relish to relish.  But I guess it was not a good seller for Heinz, because my local grocery store tells me that it is no longer available from their supplier.  Luckily I bought a case from Amazon about six months ago.  I took a bottle to a local sporting event for their concession stand and it was an instant hit, both on burgers and hot dogs.  It has just enough cayenne pepper to make you appreciate the heat, but it is nowhere near overpowering or even painful.  This was a very nicely executed condiment from a great condiment maker.  I hope they bring it back (I only have ten bottles left...that might last me four months)."
1,"This is hard to find at my local supermarkets so getting a case at a cheap price was an awesome find for me.  I love the combination of sweet and spicy and put it on everything. (Has a good kick so beware.) It's thick, good and convenient in these bottles.  The price  I paid was a little over ten bucks so definitely a good deal!"
1,"I don't use any other sweet pickle relish since trying this.  I store it upside down in the fridge so it's always ready to go.  I mainly use it in egg salad and tuna salad.  It adds a zip but it's really not too hot.  Maybe I don't use enough of it to get a bite from it.  Good on any sandwiches, hot dogs, burgers, thousand island dressing, and my favorites - tuna and egg salads.<br /><br />This isn't sold in stores around here and I've never found it in stores - I saw it on Amazon and took a chance and so glad I did.  It's  a mainstay for us.  Please keep carrying this, Amazon.  It's a nice, sweet pickle relish...good flavor, colors are bright, not a lot of liquid, squeezes out of the over-sized top easily...just a slight hotness to it.  I really don't understand why this isn't on grocery shelves."
1,"Great tasting relish , got my local food store manager looking to stock it , the meat cutters loved it also everyone is hooked on it. Great taste with that extra zing."
1,"Imagine crunchy little almond pieces enrobed in silk made of Nutella and you have the wonderfulness of a Giamanda chocolate. These are so amazing, if/when I have a kid, I plan to name them ""Giamanda""..."
1,A friend brought these when he came to visit from Belgium they are so delicious that I'm ordering more.  Literally the best chocolate i have ever ate.
1,"I have been ordering these chocolates as gifts for my Mother and my Mother-in-law for a couple years. I tried them myself first. These are so good and decadent I have had nothing but thanks and praise from all who have received them. These are not cheap, but you get what you pay for. Smooth, delicious, the only problem they disappear too fast unless you hide them."
0,"You might as well save your money on this product. I had been looking forward to receiving this so much, but wound up so disappointed. First of all, the product looks nothing like the picture shown on the packaging. It is not a croissant as we know it; it looks more like an ordinary roll and VERY small at that! What made it worse, is that as I was eating it, I kept wondering WHERE the creamy custard filling was. It wasn't until I reached almost the end, that I got it! Yes, the filling is delicious, but if they put in more than HALF a tsp. of it, I'd be surprised.<br />Another point to consider...why do they charge over $8.00 to ship this product, when it's as light as a feather? Please consider the product itself only costs $4.49!!!! I've never written a review before, but am feeling so outraged by this, that I felt I had to warn others."
0,"I just tried this 10 minutes ago and it smells and tastes like medicine.  Strawberry from faerie's finest is fairly good and blueberry is kind of hard to taste, but right now I can't get rid of this medicine grape smell in my room! Buy grape somewhere else."
1,"I recommended this product to my daughter, she ordered this caviar and was very pleased. She recommends it to everyone out there."
0,"Not very happy with the quality of this product, was really watery,the flavor was not really pleasant, ""I purchase same product in two different date and was the same running eggs"". Maybe in the future the seller should suggest something different,more close to CAVIAR, "" just because is black and taste like fish do sent justify....."""
1,"I bought these b/c I felt a sinus infection creeping up on me...spring allergies are wreaking havoc once again. I love drinking anise tea so I saw these ""Jakemans Throat and Chest"" lozenges, anise flavored, and wanted to give them a try. They are deliciously smooth and have helped soothe my sore throat and another great side effect, they have really helped clear my sinus passages too. Great little lozenges, I will keep these in my medicine cabinet for sure."
1,"Your basic tin of mints.  I don't like them as well as Altoids, but they are great for my Chicago-themed party.  I would definitely order again."
1,"How stupid can we be, buying water, when it come free right out of your tap. That is, until you research the origin of Fluoride and realize, what on earth is it doing in our drinking water.  Until you research what it means to try and shift your body into a more stabalized alkalized state, until you research what all this nonesense concerning alkalinity and acidity and what it means to us. This water is 9.5 alkalized and that's pretty awsome, it's also revearsed osmosis which is the only way to remove fluoride and it is infused with ""proper"" electrolytes that we desperately need.  Water is supposed to be 7.0 completley neutral, and it's generally understood that below 7.0 resides acidity.  I used to drink Smart Water, which is also reverse osmosis, but upon research I found that the Smart water was a staggering 4.5, NOT EVEN NEUTRAL.  Obviously they did something wrong, so when you consider buying water, please do some research so you will never think that your getting ripped off buying something that you think you can get for free!"
1,I was very dehydrated and drinking the other bottle water was not helping.  I read a book title Seven Pillars of Health which mentioned that water with PH 8 and above would help.  I purchased this water which taste is excellent and it doesn't leave you feeling bloated or full.<br />Due to my dehydration my body was very acidic causing my silver jewelry to turn black.  After two weeks of drinking this water my body was no longer acidic or dehydrated.
1,"Just a quick note to say this gets me through hot yoga class.  I actually breathe better if I drink this.  While in hot yoga, I can sometimes panic thinking I need water, but then when I have a sip of this i notice a calming feeling.  It is remarkable.  I also drink it during a day when i have a lot to do.  It calms me then.  I think it quenches thirst...thanks very much.."
1,"I love this water and have been carting it home in cases from Whole Foods until I found it on Amazon. It is about $3.00 cheaper than the price at WF (including the case discount). So far I have gotten 3 cases. The first 2 were intact but in the third, the inner box had busted open. Fortunately, the bottles were all intact.."
1,"I like this water, in part because the ph is 8.5 which is supposed to be better for you. In addition, it tastes good, and I often won't drink enough water because I don't like the way other sources of water taste. However, the price noted here ($66.00+) for 12 1.5 liter bottles is ABSOLUTELY INSANE! I just got home from Mother's Market where one bottle is $1.39! Whole Foods also carries it for $1.69/bottle. Save your money, or, if you have money to burn, do something productive with it, donate to an animal shelter or something and buy your water elsewhere!"
0,It is a gimmick. Do not waste your money. Water is not regulated so a company can claim it does any thing
1,"My dog went through a lot of different food in her short 3 years of life. I tried Nutro, Blue Buffalo, All organic fancy stuff that's sold only at this small ID organic pet food place, and I have to say this is her favorite. It's bit pricey, and apparently according to my friend Eukanuba should be boycotted because they do experiment on animals (I don't know if its true or not), but this seem to make her the happiest. Also, for some odd reason, my cats (they're very finicky when it comes to food) starts to eat my dogs food for some reason. The cats eat the The Blue Buffalo Co. BLUE Wilderness, but most of the time they're at the dogs bowl, eating this stuff, so go figure.<br /><br />Thought I'd share, since I've never seen this with my dog and cats. Weird thing is that Dog use to steal Nutro cat food from the cats, but wouldn't touch the Blue Buffalo stuff.<br /><br />p.s. my dog looks like the Border Collie on this bag."
1,"This is a great product! I give my service dog two or three tablespoons in her food twice a day. This keeps her regular. She has not had diarrhea since I started doing this. Unfortunately it is hard to find it available during late spring and summer months. She seems to be getting a bit constipated since we ran out of pumpkin. BTW, she is 60 lbs. so if your dog is smaller you don't need to feed as much. Pumpkin is wonderful for dogs to eat if they are constipated or have diarrhea."
1,This product is out of this world delicious! I have no clue why people need pumpkin PIE because this pureed pumpkin simply mixed with stevia is out of this world good! I will definitely buy this product in bulk again as I love pumpkin... out of the can with a spoon!<br /><br />Libby's Pumpkin is definitely the best out of all the canned pumpkins out there! I got out of my way to buy it... which is why I resorted to the internet when I realize that there was a shortage!
1,"This is what to use if you want to make the most consistent, most delicious pumpkin pie! Libby's 100% Pure Pumpkin in the can. Libby's also makes a Pumpkin Pie Filling in a can, but stay away from it, the results will not be as good.<br /><br />Usually, supermarkets stock Libby's 100% Pure Pumpkin in the smaller 15 oz can. This extra-large (double sized) 29 oz can is often difficult to find....even during Thanksgiving and Christmas season.<br /><br />A single 15 oz can makes one deep dish 9"" pie (4 cup volume) or two shallow 9"" pies (2 cup volume). If you are making two deep dish pies buy the 29 oz can which is far more economical. I made three pies for Thanksgiving, so I bought one 29 oz and one 15 oz cans.<br /><br />This is what comes in the can: 100% pure pumpkin....which can also be called pumpkin puree or solid pack pumpkin. Nothing else, so salt, no preservatives. The pumpkin is cooked during the canning process so you could eat it straight from the can, should you so desire.<br /><br />The pumpkin pie recipe is on the back of the can. I've tried other, fancier, more complicated recipes over the years but have always come back to the tried and true because, to me, this is what pumpkin pie is supposed to taste like. You get a fragrant and flavorful traditional pie with an excellent texture. The recipe calls for sugar, evaporated milk, eggs, cinnamon, ground cloves, ground ginger, and salt. I also add 1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg and a dash of white pepper. Also, I like to slightly froth the eggs because it gives the filling a smoother and more delicate almost custard-like texture.<br /><br />The recipe calls for baking the pie 15 minutes at 425 and then 40-50 minutes at 350. I cover the crust with foil for the first 25 minutes to keep it from getting too brown. Also, I find that 40 minutes at 350 is more than enough. Don't over-bake! If a knife comes out clean from the center of the pie, its done.<br /><br />For comparison, this 29 oz.can would normally go for about three ninety nine in your average supermarket.<br /><br />One last thing, if you remove the label from the can, you will find other recipes and helpful tips printed on the other side. Its a total win-win!"
1,"There are tons of great pumpkin pie recipes that work wonderfully with this product.  But my favorite way to use this one is in a smoothie...it's incredible!!  There are so many ways to make it: I've used plain yogurt, cinnamon, nutmeg, almond milk, sometimes ginger, crushed ice and even a banana.  Any way you make it, it will be a delicious pumpkin smoothie/shake. You can even add a little vanilla protein powder.  I LOVE this product!!"
0,"The price of this product was outlandish. One half of the cans arrived with major dents, even though the package appeared to be in perfect condition. However the shipment arrived quickly. The contents of the one can we have used (the one most seriously dented) were fine."
1,No complaints about the case of pumpkin.  My family enjoys pumpkin pie all year round and this saves carrying them home every other week or so.
1,"To be honest, I didn't think mixed greens in a can would taste this good! Used it for a recipe that called for frozen spinach and tasted even better with the spices and seasonings. Highly recommend for a recipe and on its own as a side dish, too!"
0,"Just bought a 12 pack of this and Orange Crush; the Orange Crush is good, not as good as I remembered but drinkable.  The Sunkist has a strange bitter taste to it---makes me feel like I gulped a chemical experiment not a refreshing beverage.  It's not as bad as the generic Big K, which is quite awful, but I don't think I can finish the rest."
1,This soda rocks. A welcome change from Pepsi colas and Coke Colas of the world. It taste sweet and great. They got the orange color right on the nose. Don't drink too much of this stuff or it will turn your lips and your teeth orange. Overall a great change from Pepsi and Coke Cola with a great taste. I give this soda a 10 out of 10.
1,Thanks for taking the time to make sure you had exactly what I needed.  The product is great and I look forward to working with you in the future!  Take care.
1,"LOVE the S & B Curry pastes. The Hot is the best flavor of all, but they are all good. This is the easiest way to make a really good curry at home. Little fuss and little mess and this stuff served with lamb, potatoes, carrots over rice the next day is even better!"
1,"I first discovered this product in Kmart in Oahu, Hawaii.  I'm so glad Amazon had this to make my curry dishes premium!!!"
1,"This is the best Curry I have ever found, but the price was double what I would pay in the store.  Look for another source."
1,"I've been using these ""mixes"" for several years and they are so great. Couldn't be an easier meal to prepare. Nice with added veggies-- green or red peppers, carrots, onions, a little potato-  but not necessary to make a very tasty and unique meal.<br />I used to put raisins and slivered almonds on top as a garnish but lately have just been throwing some raisins in to the mix while cooking and it's great that way. My brother adds some pineapple chunks when he makes it. I've given up finding these locally so I have my California people send me some -- but I think Amazon is cheaper."
1,"This is an awesome curry paste to use with coconut milk. For what ever reason the combination of the two work reaaly well. I have used this paste with chicken, shrimp and minced lamb and each time it has worked out really well. I also simmer coconut milk with this paste and the protein and the two work very well together."
1,I love this curry but all the stores around here in Beaumont have stopped selling it.  Only place I could find was here on amazon.  But turns out amazon free shipping is not a good deal.  They wait one week before they ship.  One of amazon partners on here jvc or something like that you can order this for $29 bucks and pay $6 dollars for shipping  and get it shipped out right away with out having to wait and get it for a total $1 cheaper than from amazon.<br /><br />I'm still waiting on my shipment.  But I love curry alot so I guess it's worth the hassle.  But next time I'm ordering on jvc  instead of Amazon.  !
1,"I ordered the hot mix by mistake because I didn't read carefully enough. It didn't matter this mix is great and not burn your face off hot, which I hate.  Super easy and quick to make and very tasty.  Highly recommended."
1,"The first time I ordered this product, I only got a small amount. This time I went big! It has a wonderful smell. Great for cooking.. adds a great flavor (the smell goes away when cooking). It smells NOTHING like coco-butter--which I hate. It really does smell like a fresh cracked coconut.<br /><br />It also feels great on the skin after shaving or exfoliating. A small bit on hair after washing keeps it smelling wonderful and shining.<br /><br />It does come frozen and is a solid at room temp. Just place it outside or on a heater vent for  a few moments to make it fluid."
1,I love this oil. It has completely changed the way my hair feels and looks. It used to be dry and brittle but now it's soooooooo soft and manageable within less than a month of use. It's great.
1,"Great packaging and amazing flavor make this a perfect product. There isn't a more flavorful ketchup on the market, and I have tried dozens of them."
1,"Look, we all know that HEINZ TOMATO KETCHUP is a fantastic flavor enhancer for a wide variety of foods (especially French fries). But this, ladies and gentlmen, THIS is what HEINZ TOMATO KETCHUP was made for:<br /><br />*1.5 lbs. lean ground beef<br />*half an onion, sliced and diced<br />*2 eggs<br />*dash of milk (2% fat recommended)<br />*4 table spoons <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NJEMFM"">Heinz Worcestershire Sauce</a><br />*2 table spoons <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DZMU"">Tony Roma's Barbeque Sauce</a><br />*1/2 table spoon <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QD5XHK"">Heinz Distilled White Vinegar</a><br />*pinch of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B6FLPW"">McCormick Garlic Salt</a><br />*season with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012ORABA"">McCormick Black Pepper</a><br />*add sprinkling of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W283DC"">Quaker Oats</a><br /><br />*stir/mix thoroughly; place in cooking pan<br /><br />*cover top of meatloaf with a layer of HEINZ TOMATO KETCHUP<br />*sprinkle liberally with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00032A8UM"">Lawry's Seasoned Salt</a><br /><br />*bake at 385 degrees F for 50-55 minutes<br /><br />*Enjoy<br /><br />It's the best meatloaf on the planet, hands down, and its ultimate flavor is made possible, in part, by zesty HEINZ TOMATO KETCHUP.

1,"I had braces and doctor recommends me using straw for all the drinks.  I can use those plastic ones for the cold drink but not for the hot drink. Especially, I like drinking hot tea.  Thus, I bought this straw for that purpose.  No metal taste at all.  I just need to be careful not to break it.  So far, it works well."
1,"My wife loves this straw.  It is well made, there is a slight rounding over at the ends like a table top, and it is much thicker than we'd anticipated.  The product exceeds our expectations.  We'd buy another.  It was also well packaged and the packaging was easily removed (Amazon box with a box with bubble wrap around it inside)."
0,"I thought it was so cool that there could be a reusable straw that you could see through so you know if it's dirty or if whatever you're drinking is getting through. Unfortunately, the glass material makes it bulky and hard to not dribble when you're drinking. Also, it's hard to store since I can't put it with my other utensils since it might roll around and break. So yes, I probably wouldn't buy another one but it's fun to use once in a while."
1,I'm very pleased with this purchase.  Heavy duty glass straw.  The little brush cleaner works well. I like it. I would recommend this item.
1,"My husband always begs me for a quarter whenever we pass a gumball machine, so for his birthday I wanted to get him a private stash of gumballs.  These are perfect because they are packaged five to a sleeve, will stay fresh longer than an unwrapped bulk purchase and he can take them with him when he commutes between Seattle and Los Angeles.  The flavors are very intense and long lasting.  He was very surprised and happy with the gumballs."
1,"I have drunk ""english-blends"" of tea in various forms and guises. But being a wee bit Scottish, I tend to like everything in life, ""maxed-out"".  Almost all tea blends from various companies have FAILED to meet my criterion of ""Maximum Tea Experience"". Now, along comes Yorkshire Gold tea. Yorkshire Gold tea is carefully blended in North Yorkshire England by Taylors of Harrogate, and part of the real secret to this tea is the company's attention to DETAILS.  Now undoubtedly, such teas like ASSAM (from North-East India) will give you some strength, but not always enough brightness.  ""Strength"" works well at the Middle and FINISH of the flavour gamut, but initially, it is Brightness which catches your palate's attention and then the Stength simply Underscores it.  It's sort of like playing a huge C chord on a concert piano in double octaves and then you gently add a LOW Contra C.  The deep low note brings out the richness of the chord.  The case is the same here with Yorkshire Gold.  So why Yorkshire Gold and not another brand?  The parent company in Harrogate is a superlative corporation who takes great pains at CONSISTENCY.  The magic is in the Details.  I am actually drinking a cup of Yorkshire Gold RIGHT NOW as I type this, and I can tell you, I have never found a company more consistent, attentive to details, and maddeningly insistent upon excellence.  Through myriads of experiments and counter-experiments, Taylors has discovered what GRABS the tea-drinker's ""Gustatory"" attention, if you will.  But there's more:  this blend both refreshes and relaxes you like none other.<br />Additionally, there is something here to which coffee drinkers may relate: AROMA.  When I make the loose or bag tea variants, both exude an almost beefy richness in bouquet.  The process of mixing furiously boiling fresh water with the tea invaribly and consistently produces a fine aroma akin to the scent of a British Sunday Lunch where a delectable roast beef is the order of the day.  Rich, piquant, and satisfying.  If your brand of tea does not do ALL that I have noted ... consider a change."
1,"If you like your tea strong and black, similiar to fine, mild coffee, then this is the tea for you. This tea is not delicate or light in any way. It is bold and robust while at the same time having a pleasant, smooth taste. Yorkshire Tea is unique and wonderful. My day is not complete until I have had a cup or two. Needless to say, I buy it in bulk quantities. I find this GOLD version to be a ""touch"" more refined than the regular one."
1,"I was hooked on this company's tea twenty years ago on a semester abroad in York, England.<br /> Good, strong, lovely- colored, rich-tasting, incomparable brew.<br /> I am an unashamed tea snob.<br />If you like it weak, go find something else."
1,"I'm an American, born and bred, but also an admitted British tea snob. And this is my absolute favorite bagged tea. I love TofA Gold as a loose leaf, but sometimes I just want to grab a quick mug. These bags are an excellent bagged cuppa!<br /><br />Great rich flavored blend of black teas, without the funk of some Chinese varieties or the perfume-y taste of other blends. Good balance all around.<br /><br />If you appreciate a really good cup of tea, with the convenience of a tea bag, this is the tea for you."
1,"I love my tea, and my favorite is Yorkshire Gold tea.  It has a rich, full-bodied flavor that is not diminished by adding a little milk and sugar!  The color, after adding milk, is a beautiful, golden tan.  Each bag will make 2-3 good, large cups of tea, depending upon how strong you prefer your tea; therefore, the cost is comparable to ""lesser"" teas.  It is also my wife's favorite, and we have tried many different brands over the years."
1,"My wife and myself have been tea drinkers for over 40 years, and when i found this tea in a store in Portland OR, it was love at first sip. every time we find a store that carried it, soon it was not available. So now i watch for a good price at Amazon and we buy it by the case. Make sure it is the GOLD ...<br />Pete C"
1,If you are a black tea drinker you will be spoiled by the taste of this tea. I find it really difficult to drink anything else. the flavor is rich but not bitter. A nice cuppa!
1,"Many years ago a friend in Eugene, Oregon, told me that if I ever drank Yorkshire Gold, I would never want anything else, and she was right. Today,when a shipment comes into a store, word of mouth makes the boxes disappear fast.  Once, when I asked a cashier where I could find Yorkshire Gold, he went to a back room in the store and came back out, holding the boxes of tea as if it were contraband, looking both ways before he took it to the check stand.  When Yorkshire Gold comes in to a store, there is a run on it, and you can look down the shelf where it was stacked and see a blank spot.  I have heard it is going to be difficult to get this tea in the US, although the tea drinkers in the US are responsible for its great success."
1,This is strong Breakfast Tea. You can get a second cup from one bag.  The flavor is very satisfying.  True English taste.
1,"Taylors of Harrogate Yorkshire Gold Tea is such a perfect tea that once you have tasted it, no other tea will do.  Each bag is strong enough for two good, very rich cups of tea, so it is actually a very reasonably priced tea. It is a strong tea, and not for fans of America's typical kind of tea."
1,This is a nice well rounded black breakfast tea. It steeps nicely and can carry a little milk in it. I like my tea and I have been drinking the Yorshire Gold for several years and have not been swayed by any other teas.
1,"A Scottish friend introduced me to hot tea with milk 20 years ago.  She started me on PG Tips, which I can take or leave.  I then ordered a lot of different types while trying to find one that suited me.  YG is it - and has been for many years.  It is strong, but one bag will make 2-3 cups depending upon how strong you take it.  While strong, it has a clean, clear flavor - not woody or fruity - just good, ole tea.  I've also tried the red label - not nearly as good as Gold.  I sip others on occasion, but my ""every morning"" brew will always be YG!!"
1,"Comes closest to my memories of ""builders tea"" when I lived in England.  Better flavour than other bagged teas I've tried.  Reasonable price if purchased in the 6-pack Amazon offers."
1,"Really good, kind of strong, but not bitter. Has more of a mouthfeel than other teas - might make it a good substitute for coffee."
1,"As an avid drinker of Taylors of Harrogate, when I discovered that there was a ""Gold"" tea of the same brand, I hurriedly purchased it, anticipating being shot into hitherto unknown heights of tea-drinking bliss. I knew when the package arrived, as it descended into my home in a brilliant shaft of light. The package unwrapped and opened itself and a teabag jumped into my waiting cup.<br /><br />My palate revealed that there is a difference in the quality and smoothness of this tea. The tea also presents an exquisite gold colour while steeping in the glass. The question is whether this warrants a purchase at a higher price?  The regular brand, in the red box, is an outstanding tea already and likely the best one can get in the States.<br /><br />There would be no need to feel that life was less lived having only sampled the regular Yorkshire.  Truly, if needing to save money, one could consider themselves a lucky man with buying regular Yorkshire. If your purse contains a little more, then let fortune bestow the privilege of adding this to your daily repertoire."
1,"I'm from england originally and love this tea so I ordered from Amazon.com. The tea is excellent and the delivery time, etc. was fast. I recommend highly. Thanks"
1,"This tea, teabag or loose tea, tastes the way tea should.<br />I have used both for several years. End of review."
1,"After 10 years in Yorkshire there are so many things I will miss:  the rolling countryside, the Yorkshire dales, lambing trips in April, blustery winters, Yorkshire in bloom, and countless other things.  Being able to continue the tea tradition I picked up while there makes leaving there more bearable.  Yorkshire Gold is my favorite, but all Taylors of Harrogate and Yorkshire blend teas are spectacular.  And if you get a chance, why not enjoy your cuppa in a Betty's Tea Room:  the guilty pleasure I will miss the most!"
1,"This is very good tea.  We were introduced to F&M Royal Blend tea on a trip to London, but it is not available in the U.S.  After that brand, this is the next best thing."
1,"there is nothing like a fine cup of warm Yorkshire tea in the morning.  When I found that I could purchase this online, I did so quickly and was rewarded with a prompt delivery.  Just in time for the holidays, and a couple snowstorms that confined us to our home to enjoy many cups of tea."
1,"I usually need two tea bags to make a cup of tea that satisfies me, but his tea is so full-bodied and fragrant that one bag makes a really intense, delicious cup. I'm normally a coffee person, but I've been enjoying this as my morning beverage for months with no temptation to switch back."
1,"Yorkshire Gold is a very robust tea.  I do need to watch the steeping time or it is super strong!  Two bags will make a nice pot of tea (with Red Rose I need four).  I may prefer Yorkshire Gold brewed for iced tea with sugar and lemon rather than with milk and sugar as a breakfast tea.  Either way, I do not like it with honey.  Overall, Yorkshire Gold is a very nice tea, but I prefer PG Tips."
1,This is an excellent tea. It is robust and tastes great with milk and/or sugar. It is good anytime of the day.
1,"The very best black tea there is! I agree that there are a few good black teas, but if consistency and a deep, rich, delicious quality in a tea are attributes you desire, then you must consume Yorkshire Gold. I have enjoyed this tea for many, many years, and recommend it highly.  Brian"
1,"This is a robust, rich English style tea worthy of the ""gold"" rating.  The price in the six-pack configuration is very good.  I have been drinking this tea for several years."
1,"This tea is a true English luxury, but once you taste it, it is difficult to be satisfied with less than the finest tea this company makes. Yorkshire Gold tea has more flavor and character than most teas.<br /><br />The secret seems to be in the high quality of the teas selected for Yorkshire Gold and in the shape of the tea bag which allows for the tea leaves to spread out more and I think this enhances the ability for a full tea flavor to develop.<br /><br />This tea blend is perfect to steep along with a cinnamon stick. It is strong enough to serve with whipped cream and a dash of nutmeg.<br /><br />The art on the box was painted by Lizzie Sanders and it sets a nice English mood for your tea drinking experience.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
1,"After tea, Watson and I did not stay for any afters since we were in a rush to catch a train with a friend of ours that we will just call, ""Agatha.""  ""Agatha"" was always such a great story teller!  Murder, conspiracy, ""who-dunnits"" and the like.  I for one, was very fond of Agatha, considering she was one of the few women in our<br />town that had all of her original teeth and one of three that had both of her thumbs.  (That is another story for another day.)<br /><br />Getting back to the tea.  Soothing, lovely with a scone....missing the days of being pushed on the swing as a<br />child."
1,"For tea lovers it doesn't get any better than Taylor's of Harrowgate Yorkshire Gold.<br />We found this tea in a supermarket in Gainesville, Florida while visiting my wife's sister a couple of years ago.<br />Back home, in Virginia we checked several upscale stores and couldn't find it.<br />Searched Amazon and there it was. Now have a standing order with Amazon and have been very pleased."
1,"I am a bit of a coffee snob, but have not studied teas much yet. I have a variety but not a great deal of knowledge. So from a ""layman's"" perspective I can say, this is very, very nice black tea. Compared to some other loose-leaf black teas I've usually purchased from the Indian markets, this is relatively very rich, fragrant, and not at all bitter. I'm enjoying it immensely and have shared it with coworkers, who also thought it was great. So, take that for what it is: a tea layperson's endorsement. :)"
1,"Yorkshire Gold Tea is a consistently high quality product that provides outstanding flavour with each & every cup. It provides satisfaction that meets our expectations of what a ""good cup of tea"" should be - pleasingly robust but, without a bitter aftertaste. It is the best tea available!"
1,I treated my friends and I to a bunch of these dry aged steaks.  Amazing.  My NY Strip was as tender as a ribeye.
1,"We have 2 dogs; one is a Aussie Shepard mix and the other is a Blue Healer mix. They just love to go after these treats in their bongs. They last for at least a half hour, and believe me, this is very benificail to my wife and me."
1,My Boston Terrier loves her kong toy and these peanut butter snaps.  It took her about a year to finally break the large kong rubber toy (She's a very aggressive chewer)
0,"I gave this product two stars because it did seem to keep unpleasant odors at bay. However, the actual scent of this deodorant was unpleasant itself. It was just an odd smell on the skin. In the applicator, it was fine, but on a few different people ( who rubbed it on their forearms to test), the scent was not a good one. I did not like the way it reacted with me. It also gave me an itchy rash so I had to give up on it. One person said it smelled like urine,not good at all! But I didn't give it one star only because it seemed to do its job by keeping away the BO, I think."
1,"For about a year I've been trying to find a nontoxic deodorant that actually works.  I'm a sweaty person, so this is not an easy task. However yesterday, I picked this stuff up and it works very well, I wore it for about 15 hours without any BO, and woke up this morning still smelling fresh.  This one actually works!"
1,We all love the Tree Hugger K-Cups. It's one of the best ones we've had. I read this flavor was in danger of being discontinued so I will have to stock up just in case. That would be a huge bummer if they actually did discontinue them.
1,I am not a huge coffee drinker but we got a sample packet of these at work.  Great flavor and great taste.  The entire office agrees that this is one of their favorite.
1,"Since acquiring a Keurig-type brewer several months ago, I've been sampling, one or two at a time, all of the bold varieties I've been able to find in a K-cup.  I'm in no way a connoisseur of coffee; just like a straightforward, strong, not bitter, cup or two to start my day.  Although not my absolute favorite among the brews I've tried, Tree Hugger ranks near enough to the top of my list for me to say that I'll definitely purchase it again.  Try it and enjoy!<br /><br />Also, because my income is truly ""fixed,"" it's an added bonus that I can purchase this in the 50-pack quantity--much easier to fit into a monthly budget!"
1,"This is my second time ordering this product and ive been totally happy with both.  I love the full bodied coffee and the title doesnt hurt. After all I am a ""Tree Hugger"" and I love the idea behind this coffee. The seller is very prompt and my order comes fast. On this last order I was almost out, had one more cup left and went to my mailbox...there it was and I was so thrilled. I will continue to order this as I run low.  Thank all responsible for this product and its delivery.<br />Coffee People, Tree Hugger, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers (Pack of 50)"
1,This coffee is for coffee lovers. My husband thought it was too strong. I thought it was just what the name implies.  Great taste and great coffee! This is one of my favorites.
1,"This is by far the favorite in our house. We have ordered all sorts of different brands, variety packs, and flavors. This is even better than the Starbucks machine I have at work. I like the Donut shot also, but this my favorite. Rest assured, the 50-pack is a good choice."
1,"I've tried a lot of K-Cups and this is by far my favorite.  I like a very strong, but not burnt/bitter coffee.  It is hard to find extra bold k-cups that are medium, they are usually dark roast.  This one has been consistently strong (even on the 10oz setting of my Keurig mini).  I am really don't understand the other reviewers who say it is weak.  I know that I am very picky about weak coffee, I can't drink any of the non-bold k-cups as they all taste watery to me, but I've never had a problem with this.  I am wondering if it may be because I have the mini and it brews this k-cup differently than the regular or alternately if some people confuse dark roast with coffee being strong.<br />Anyways this has a very nice strong non-bitter taste, I would say there are hints of chocolate in it.  Very tasty.  I am also a big fan of the Coffee People Donut Shop coffee."
1,I really like Coffee People brand K-Cups and Tree Hugger does not disappoint! This coffee is strong enough without being bitter like some coffees.
0,"I order K-Cups in the 50 packs all the time and look for the good discounts.  However, the Tree Hugger was too weak, actually tasted ""watery"".  I normally order the organic coffees, Columbian and sometimes donut shop, so my preference is not for 'robust' coffees.  but, this was too weak even for my taste."
0,"I purchased the ""Organic"" variety of this brand last time and I was very happy with the flavor and strength for a 10 oz cup. The ""Organic"" variety was not available this time so I ordered this other organic ""Tree Hugger"" variety. It seems that the flavor is much weaker for this variety versus the ""Organic"". On a side note, the taste is good if you brew a small cup (i.e. 6 oz)."
1,"Because we were having guests for a visit, I ordered extra coffee.  We found tree hugger to be a real good bold coffee, it was full bodied with out any bitterness.  I will order this coffee again."
1,"Coffee People's Tree Hugger Coffee is the favorite at my office. We have cycled through many different Keurigs. Most of them end up not tasting strong enough or flavorful enough, since we are accustomed to awesome local coffees from Blue Bottle and Four Barrel.  But Tree Hugger is an exception. It makes a well-rounded, solid-tasting cup of coffee and continues to be our favorite after every new K-Cup we try."
1,"Great coffee, and I feel good knowing it's fair trade as well as organic.  For an organic product, it is priced reasonably.  Shipping is fast."
1,"So happy to have found one of my favorite Keurig Kcups at a cheaper price. Full, dark, robust, organic, yum."
0,"I am not taking to the taste of this coffee. For me, it had a medium roast flavor, (meaning not too strong), and a slight burnt-bitter aftertaste. There is an ever-so slight hint of cocoa in the flavor, not to it's detriment. I did not want a super-strong coffee, and I was  hoping that this would not harbor the burnt/bitter aftertaste that some of the stronger coffees seem to have. In any case, I am trying to find a medium roast, good smooth coffee to replace the Van Houtte Kenyan k-cups, since they are not being sold now, and Tree Hugger is not the one to fill those shoes for my taste."
1,Not as bold as Tree Hugger and a little bitter. All in all there are better choices...Jet Fuel and Tree Hugger in the bolds.
0,"Its OK...Tad weak for me...Love CP kcups but this one was a tad disappointing...Only CP Kcup i've tried so far and didnt care for too much......Dont get me wrong..its not bad...just 'fair' to me but others may love it.<br /><br />I can make it a tad better using 2 kcups for 1 cup, but even then it still is not up to par, in my opinion anyway, to other CP blends. Just a tad too weakish and mild on the flavor for my individual tastes.<br /><br />I believe this is supposed to be a 'bold' Kcup. Which doesnt mean a super dark roast..bold refers to them adding I think 20% more coffee per kcup. However, when I shake a kcup compared to all other 'bolds' this doesnt seem to have as much coffee.<br /><br />Plus, it must be a light roast, as well.....<br /><br />Saw some reviews saying this is as bold as it gets...<br /><br />Man.,..if anybody things this is bold/dark/strong/rich.....then dont even try organic, jet fuel, black tiger, wake up etc....cause those are far bolder/stronger/richer/darker with a whole lot more flavor...each very unique as all CP blends are, including tree hugger...I just think tree huggers uniqueness is far to bland all around for me....."
1,"A good balance, very tasty, the only k-cup we buy on a regular basis. The other coffee people flavors are usually pretty good as well, but the tree hugger is our favorite by far."
1,"The title really says it all.  I have tried so many different types of K-cups and Tree Hugger is full flavored and smooth, and not at all bitter.  This is my absolute favorite and it is the only one I will buy now."
1,"Tree hugger is the best coffee I've ever had.  It is mellow, full bodied, but doesn't have the bitter  edge that other rich blends have.  I certainly hope this is not discontinued because it is really the best!"
1,it is comperable to gj's not quite but it will do still good coffee i have a sensitivity to cafine seems to be in how the deans are roasted this seems to be fine in that way
1,You really can't go wrong with Coffee People K-cups. I like their bolder stronger flavors but decided to give this organic one a try this time. Definitely not as strong as some of their others but it has a good taste to it and no bitter acidic aftertaste. If you like really strong coffee I'd try something of theirs more along the lines of Jet Fuel but this is a nice change of pace.
1,I have been looking for a good dark roast coffee for awhile and this one is really good.  It comes the closest I have found to a brewed in the pot cup of coffee and I am always sad when I run out!
1,The past two years this has been my go to Bold.  The 50 pk is a great value and the coffee reminds me of Rain forest Espresso or Santa's Buzz.
1,I think this is better than Starbucks coffee. The best part is the freshness that you get from each cup that you make. Love it and have it at least twice a day. So lets have a cup!
0,"Coffee People has always been my favorite brand of coffee.  This is probably because I prefer bold and full bodied coffees.  I was told by one of their employees  their secret is they use 30% - 40% more coffee than the competition.  Since they were acquired by Green Mountain Coffee, who is buying up all the K-cup makers, this brand is going downhill quickly.  It is probably because the profit margin is less because of the extra coffee needed to make their brand special.  They used to have at least 10 different blends, now they are down to four.  They have done away with three of the best flavors, Organic, French Roast, and Santa's Buzz (seasonal).<br /><br />This Tree Hugger seems to be representative of the ""new"" Coffee People brand, it is weak, bland, and boring."
1,"would purchase again if it goes on sale. not worth the regular price though.  as with all k-cups now, the price has inhibited my purchases. no reason for the price increase other than pure greed. coffee prices are cheaper now than they were in the past."
1,"I'm a big fan of Coffee People bold and dark roasts, and this one is no exception. Tree Hugger has an almost chocolaty taste and well balanced. The fact that it is organic and fair trade is an excellent bonus. Note that I like a splash of milk in my coffee and seldom drink it black (only when I'm out of milk), so I cannot speak for those who take their coffee straight. Nonetheless, for those who like it bold, I recommend Tree Hugger, as well as the other Coffee People bolds: Wake Up Call, Organic, Jet Fuel, and (especially) <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZDK"">Black Tiger</a>. I drink them all because they are each subtly different from the others.<br /><br />As much as I like Coffee People bolds, my favorite remains <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG"">Green Mountain Coffee Revv</a>. And, like many others, I'll be glad to see the return of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L41Y8A"">Coffee People Kona Blend</a>. Let's all pray for a good crop in Kona, Hawaii, this year."
1,"If you are one of those who prefer juice which taste like 'fresh squeezed', you will love this grapefruit juice!  It has NOTHING added to the basic juice except water, and very little of that!  The juice does not have a 'canned' taste, rather it is most like fresh.  In other words, I love this stuff!"
0,The problem with this seasoning is that it is totally overpowered by the mesquite flavor. There isn't much to the flavor profile except mesquite and more mesquite. I would take a pass on this one.
1,"Perhaps I'm not grill master, but I and my family absolutely love this stuff.  We can't get enough of it when we bbq chicken.  I haven't had it with beef, but for the chicken its superb imo."
1,"I LOVE PONS organic olive oil! PONS has graced pasta, salads, seafood, rice, farmer's market veggie dishes and dips for fresh bread (with a little Celtic Sea Salt) for several years. Exceptional taste, wonderful quality (organic, extra virgin) - it is SO delicious! I've sampled dozens of olive oils (there is such a great variety of taste and flavors available). PONS is my personal favorite by far. I moved away and couldn't find it in any of the local stores, so I placed an order with pastacheese via Amazon (great experience/packed well/timely arrival - thank you pastacheese!) Very happy to have my favorite olive oil again :)"
1,"I bought these eyes to put on faces for my daughter's lunch sandwiches & fun things I do for her. I had no idea they were the size of nickels since there are no measurements!  Will use, but I'm also going to buy some smaller ones for more practical uses.  Product arrived exactly as described and promptly."
1,"I got these to make owl cupcakes, size is a nickel. I love how they were packaged, its guaranteed to not break - tightly packaged and padded. The back of the eye's are flat, so its not completely round, its like a button, but edable, and it tastes sugary good. I'm satisfied."
1,"These worms taste great.  I share these with my two nephews and they love eating them too.  I asked one of my nephews which was better, these worms or a typical gummy bear from an ordinary company, and he said that these were better because of taste and that it wasn't too hard to chew on.  I chooose getting these because of it's soft chew and taste, which can be found similarly on Black Forest gummy products.  These can melt in the mouth if you keep it in there long enough and with mininal chewing to it.  You get two five pound bags that are sure to last a while.  I would recommend to anyone to try these for themselves."
1,The worms are really good. There are 3 different colors and each worm has 2 colors on it sorted in different ways. Kind of like the pokemon Spinda.
1,"I am a gummy connoiseur of sorts and have to say that these worms taste fantastic.  The price is amazing.  Aside from Haribo brand, I think Black Forest is the next best gummy.  Proceed with reckless abandon!"
1,"Flavor makes everything tastes sooo good!! I am always looking for products to make my cooking taste good, because flavor is the key!! Price and shipping was great, as well!!"
1,"I have used this seasoning for many years as do many chefs.  Top notch seasoning!  It used to be called ""Praise Allah"" until the PC crowd complained. Seafood, soups, vegetables (Great with soup beans), pork & beef. Just discovered it available from Amazon.  Have usually purchased it through a restaurant food supply. I have never seen it in grocery stores."
1,This is my family's favorite flavor of the Hansen Diet Sodas.  It has a clean and crisp taste and is enjoyable on its own or with meals.  It even calms down an upset tummy.
0,If you like the taste of artificial strawberry flavoring then this drink is for you. Be sure that you use a blender because there is no way that you can dissolve this product in milk using a spoon.
0,"I used to love Perugina's Baci, so I decided to try this since I've never had their milk chocolate.  Somehow I was just not impressed with this bar.  It wasn't overly sweet, which is always good in my opinion, but there was something missing.  Ritter Sport has a milk chocolate cappucino bar which is better, but is a little sweet for my taste.  Before trying this one, you may want to try the one by Ritter Sport."
1,Hard to find...this particular chocolate is an essential in creating a marvelous flourless second-to-none chocolate cake.
1,I love that I can order Carnation Vanilla packets on line for a dollar less then the stores (if you can find vanilla).  Also get it in 2 days.  Now these guys were $2.50 off per 10 packets and I saved over $40 on the order.  Can't do much better than that.
1,"We're seniors now & have had Carnation Instant breakfast<br />in our home for at least fourty yers.  We enjoy it as much<br />today as we always have.  We're ordinarily not real big on<br />a sit down breakfast & so we appreciate having the nourishment<br />of a sit down morning meal sort of ""on the go"". It's a great<br />benifit to find it at such a good price on Amazon AND have<br />it delivered to our home on a regular basis.<br />Years ago Carnation used to make a coffee flavored Instant<br />Breakfast srink & it was killer good!  Seems like as many<br />varied coffee products selling so well these days they would<br />bring it back.  We'd love that, & so might you.  :)"
1,"My nutrionist ""prescribed"" Carnation Instant Breakfast (CIB) to me many years ago when I was a child. Though I think I have ""outgrown"" it but I continue to drink it, mostly for breakfast because I like the various vitamins, minerals, and protein it provides along with the convenience. Most morning it is my only form of sustenance as I rush to work. Tastes great, can't go wrong with Vanilla. Sometimes I switch things up a bit and get the variety pack which has Strawberry, Vanilla, and Chocolate. Back in the ""good old days"" a box of 10 packs cost only 3.50. Now it ranges from 4.99-6.99 hence I have decided to go online and get the bulk pack which is a good deal relatively speaking.  If only they have vanilla flavor canisters available, like they do for chocolate. Definitely recommend CIB. In fact, I have recommended it to a handful of friends."
1,"i purchase these very regularly, locally they range from 4.65 to 5.25 at the grocery stores, etc. per box.  this has been the best deal i have found plus its eligible for free shipping.  the carnation boxes are nicely packaged in a hefty cardboard box and arrive quickly.  you get 6 individual boxes of 10 count packs as the description states.  i usually blend one up with my handheld blender into a cup of milk for my boys, the taste is nice and they do enjoy it.  It is exactly what it states it is and i prefer taking the hassle out of trying to find these locally (have been sold out locally especially once school started)."
1,"Great price, fast delivery. Thank you.<br />These instant breakfasts have been a perfect extra snack for my boys on the go. While some may use it as a meal replacement, we use it for inbetween meals when a piece of fruit isnt enough. It seems better to me than chips/pastries/cookies. My boys love the vanilla flavor as it is mild and doesnt leave any after taste."
1,My husband depends on a stomach feeding tube for all nourishment.  He cannot take in anything by mouth.  Carnation  Breakfast Essentials have been a real blessing in helping to get some caloric value back into his body.  We have used as many as five packets a day.  Thank you for such a great product.  The convience of use also are of the utmost importance.
1,We need to buy these for one of our children who has special needs and the price on Amazon can't be beat.
1,"Really great stuff, each packets contains the same mount of protein of 2 eggs.  easy to make milk shake with these."
1,"I've been eating carnation instant breakfast for a few years now and this is about as a good a price as I've found (I've found it cheaper when on sale at a local store but those sales are rare). I use two cups of milk instead of the instructed one, so the flavor is diluted a bit, but still good."
1,I have purchased this product several times.<br />Prompt shipment. Good packaging.<br />Item as expected. Priced fair. Satisfied.<br />Will purchase again.
1,"This product was recommended to us by the pediatrician.  My daughter doesn't like to eat and so we have to supplement her milk to give her more protein and calories.  We dilute it more now that she's older.  For every packet of powder, we mix it with 20 ounces of milk so it's not overly sweet.  I've heard that pediasure is a lot sweeter.  I also use the carnation packets to make smoothies and they taste so much better with the packets.  Highly recommend."
1,We buy this item all the time for a quick breakfast on the go. This is not the first time I have purchased this item. I get it all the time and it is a good deal on Amazon
1,"Regular milk, even lactose free milk is hard on my stomach. I love the taste of the vanilla CIB and have found it mixes great with Almond milk (found in the dairy section next to the real milk). Almond milk also has more calcium and more protein than regular milk. I've tried mixing it with coconut milk but could still taste the coconut.<br /><br />I have vanilla CIB every morning for my breakfast, then eat a light lunch around 11, and a regular dinner at 5. There have been times when I wake during the night and find my stomach growling. I don't feel like eating but it's hard to go back to sleep with a hungry tummy. I just get up and mix one of these drinks and go back to sleep.<br /><br />To mix, I pour my tall glass about 3/4 full with almond milk. Dump in a CIB packet and stir with a spoon. Insert straw and drink. It feels odd to me to drink it by sipping on the side of the glass. The mix is a little on the thicker side and I prefer a straw EVERY time.<br /><br />My kids enjoy the chocolate CIB and they like their milk warmed first. They actually call it ""hot chocolate"". They too, have some every morning and then a light breakfast of toast or cereal."
1,"""I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavors.""<br /><br />The song is correct.  Vanilla is the finest of the flavors.  These get old if you have them everyday, and occasionaly benefit from the addition of some fruit, but you can't go wrong.  Also, the carnation brand tastes much better than the generic store brands.  This is one time where you benefit from going with the name brand."
1,"I first had Carnation Instant Breakfast as a snack when I was a kid, and now my kids love it too. We usually get Chocolate, because it is cheaper (about $10 for a 30-pack at Costco), but we prefer Vanilla (we like vanilla milkshakes better than chocolate too). $30 for this pack of 60 is not a bad price considering how much it is at the store--you might be able to find it cheaper sometimes on sale and/or with a coupon, but Amazon is so convenient that I decided to stock up.<br /><br />I love this, because it is great as breakfast on the run (my teen has it almost every day) or a yummy but healthy snack for the kids--or ME! The kids feel like they're getting a treat and I feel like they're getting vitamins!!! Sometimes I drink this instead of grabbing something from the candy bowl--tastes great and I don't feel guilty! It's a great alternative to pre-mixed chocolate milk too.<br /><br />Now if only Amazon would put this on subscribe and save... :)"
1,The taste is alright. I'm one of those weird people that really doesn't really get a kick out of eating (I eat to live not live to eat) it takes away the hunger pangs while keeping me nourished when I don't feel like eating real food.
1,"We tried this oatmeal about 2 years ago. My sister recommended it to us. It has such a wonderful flavor and texture. It's not the flakes like we're used to. It's little nuggets, steel cut, that take a little while to cook but it's well worth the extra time. It's creamy and nutty and tastes wonderful with bananas and raisins and brown sugar. I highly recommend giving this product a try!<br /><br />(If you put the oatmeal in with the water to start and let it come to a boil and then turn it down to simmer it doesn't take quite as long.)"
1,"McCann's is a new experience in oatmeal.  It takes longer to cook, but boy oh boy, is it worth it.  It's best to cook the full recipe that they speak of: one cup McCann's, four cups water.  Not real tough to remember!<br /><br />Unless you use the shortcut method, it takes over 30 minutes to make one batch.  So if you're going 'green' (energywise), try the overnight method.  And warming it up the next morning with the microwave is great; I put milk on it before nuking it.  So good when it comes out!<br /><br />Note: if you undercook McCann's, it'll be like eating pearl barley (or birdshot) that's not cooked long enough--- not a great treat.  Remember, it is full grains of oats that have been cut maybe once each, but many at a time of course.  The water must be given time to permeate the oats grains.<br /><br />Great for comfort food on those cold mornings when you want something that'll stick to your ribs, plus be good for ya.<br /><br />A friend that I and one Mr. S.G. ""Long Lense"" Johnson call ""Oatmeal Beard"", a.k.a. ""Prof. Braddock"" (don't ask)--- because he used to eat oatmeal, out of the pot, every morning for years driving to work (but it was the 'quick' stuff), well we put him on to McCann's............. a real officianado of oatmeal.  I eagerly await his review of this fine product.  I give it a huge thumbs up!"
1,The steel-cut oats from McCanns is truly a wonderful product.  And the service was excellent.  I received the product in just a few days after placing the order.
1,Product arrived quickly and wrapped properly. Quality of the oil was far beyond my expectations. Would recommend this product to anyone interested in culinary bliss.
1,"I got this for a friend for his 50th birthday.  It really took you back in time.  It was a lot of fun going through all of the different candies and letting them take you back to your childhood.  Pop rocks, burlap bag of gum nuggets, candy necklace, bit o honey, candy cigarettes, even the Hersheys candy bar had the old wrapper on it.  It was fun."
1,Lots of goodies.  She loved it.  Was fun exploring and remembering the younger candy days :)
0,"The picture makes the package look a lot bigger. The candies were very nostalgic, but way over priced for the value."
0,"I received this as a gift.  Company enclosed a receipt in box so I know how much the sender spent - had to hunt to see who it was from....plus once I saw the receipt, I realized they had paid $34 for less than $10 worth of candy.... all these candies can still be found in local stores.... gum was hard as a rock - taffy just about took my fillings out.  Really poorly done.  I will be passing this info on to the person that sent this to me.  Loved the idea of the gift -- just really bad quality."
1,I purchased this item for my wife's 50th birthday party. A little expensive but good quality and lots of fun.  We played pin the tail on the donkey and gave out pieces of 60's era candy to each player.  They loved it.  Amazing how candy from the 60's brought back good memories to everyone.
1,"This was a bit pricey for what you actually get in terms of candy, but consider it more a discussion starter and a vehicle for going down memory lane.  It is well packaged and a lot of fun. I bought it for a gift mostly because I wanted one myself and I thought the idea was very good. It is well packaged and delivery was quick. I would have given 5 stars but for the price and they tossed in several items that definitely were from the 70s, not the 60's. Good gift!"
1,"This ""gift"" was for a woman that just turned 50 years old. A great idea for decorations and stuff needed for the perfect party!"
0,The picture made it look much better and bigger. Definitely not worth the money. I should have gone and bought my own and could have made a similar box. Although my sister liked it I was very disappointed and wish I could at least get a partial refund. Advice to others: make your own they will never know!
1,Gave this to my Dad for his 50th birthday..He really liked it..It was alot of fun eating and enjoying the candy my parents grew up with...REALLY COOL GIFT..
1,A good selection of candy from the past. I had this selection sent to my daughter for a party she was giving just before Christmas. She did not open it until everyone was there so they could all enjoy the walk down memory lane together as they sampled candies from her childhood as well and their childhood of things gone by.
1,"i've brought all of the decades of candy, except for the 90's...they make wonderful gifts,and people loved them ...everyone was reliving their childhood...the only thing is, everyone is asking for squerrel nuts..."
0,"Cute idea for a 50th gift, but the soft candy was hard, perhaps indicating somewhat not fresh. Would buy again if this issue was solved."
0,I have bought this product for the last 18 months because it had no sugar and it was great for my toddler.  Well what a shock I had when the latest box I purchased said it now contains SUGAR too!!  The only organic cereal now out on the market with no added sugar or evaporated cane juice is Barbara's Organic Cereal o's.  Make a statement and do not buy this again!!  Very disappointed with Cascadian Farm...why ruin a perfectly good no-sugar cereal???
0,In the past few weeks this General Mills product was reformulated with 3 time the sugar.  This change was made without ANY changes to the packaging outside of the nutritional label.  This product went from a mainstay for us and our toddler to something we will no longer be buying.
0,"I assume market forces dictated that Cascadian Farms add sugar and a more ""refined"" appearance to their cereal, but now it's just another box of sweetened junk--albeit organic junk. Too bad. Me and my two-year-old son were very happy customers--but now we'll have to look elsewhere. And I'll have to start reading the ingredients of everything I buy from Cascadian Farms with a skeptical eye, now that I know what their business plan is."
0,"My family used this product for over 4 years, but last year the recipe was changed, sugar was added. That decision was probably driven by Cascadian Farm's desire to increase profits (cheaper production, more appealing to mainstream sugar junkies). Unfortunately, there aren't many choices right now for nutrition-conscious individuals. Even the so called organic/health cereals are loaded with sweets (all sorts of syrups, juice concentrates). Starting a morning on that note sets you up for a roller-coaster ride of high-low blood sugar. I had nothing else to do but to start cooking whole grain cereals (oatmeal, millet, buckwheat). It takes a bit of planning - you have to allocate time for cooking in the morning or cook the nigh before, but in the process you can save a ton of money. For instance, a pound of organic millet costs from $0.99 to $1.79 depending on the retailer (or $0.06 to $0.11 per oz). In the process of cooking grain absorbs water and increases it mass at least 3 fold. That makes the price of cooked cereal go down as much ($0.02 to $0.04).  Compare that to $0.48/oz price for Purely'Os! Then maybe the recipe change introduced by Cascadian Farms is truly a blessing for your wallet, if you are willing to wait 20 minutes, while you cereal is boiling on the stove. This time is not lost, but gained - you can use it to practice sun salutation to make your morning even more glorious!"
0,"I'm looking for an oat cereal to feed a young child and was excited to see that General Mills offered an organic alternative to its well-known conventionally-made Cheerios.  Imagine my dismay to see that they've recently adulterated the product both with sugar and with cheap corn fillers.  When General Mills acquired Cascadian Farms, they made a big show out of keeping on founder and CEO Gene Kahn to run the new subsidiary.  Now, Kahn holds the title of Vice President of Sustainable Development at General Mills.  It seems he's either lost touch with the company he founded, or has sold out to the interests of his new mega-corporation paymasters.<br /><br />Shame, Gene!  Is this sugared corn-stuffed junk really what you founded Cascadian Farms to produce?"
0,"We received an email back from Cascadian farms. ""People"" in the US like sugar.<br />I've enjoyed Purely O's for quite a few years until I noticed something different. I thought it was the milk, but no, I eat them from the box of the evening if I need to take medicine with food. They were a 5 star and we bought them in quantities on sale until we noticed the taste and started checking around. Sugar? If I wanted a sugary taste and sugary cereal, I'd chose a a regular branded sugary cereal, there are plenty of them."
0,"3 years ago we looked long and hard for a sugar free, whole grain finger food for our then 6 month old.  Our son enjoyed this cereal as a snack and until recently, as a cereal, but then I bought my most recent box and noticed right away they didn't look the same.  When I tasted one I immediately knew they were sweetened and sure enough, when I checked the nutrition label it showed 3g of sugar per serving.  The label is completely unchanged except for the ingredients and this is dangerously misleading.  We live in a country where diabetes is rampant and sugar can be very dangerous.  How frightening that they Cascadian Farms/General Mills would sneak sugar into their cereal without changing any of the main labelling.  I will never buy anything from them again!"
0,"These used to be our and our 9 mo. old daughter's favorite snack. Unfortunately the company changed the formula altering the flavor and the nutritional value - not for the better. We plan to throw out the current box and stop buying this product and possibly others from the organization. The reason: Cascadian Farms, and their owner General Mills, dramatically altered the product without changing the packaging. It might seem like good business; however, it comes across as deceptive. Now, to find other cereals that meet the nutritional and flavor needs we used to get in the real Purely Os."
0,"I've lost all respect for Cascadian Farm in recent weeks for taking our favorite cereal bar none and turning it into junk overnight - this cereal had been our staple for half a decade since our son was a baby (now he's almost 5), because it tasted great and had no added sugar.  I found it when specifically looking for a cereal without the sugar, and it fit the bill for years.  Then suddenly a week ago our son said it didn't taste right and refused to eat it and I looked at the box and while nothing else on the box had changed the ingredients certainly had - I had one leftover old box and the old ingredients were whole grain oat flour, whole grain barley flour, wheat starch and sea salt, and the new ingredients are whole grain oat flour, corn meal, sugar, oat fiber, wheat starch, sea salt, tapioca syrup, molasses (i.e., they have now added corn meal, sugar, oat fiber, tapioca syrup and molasses and removed whole grain barley flour).  It's completely misleading - the new box has a picture of the old Purely O's, but the new cereal looks completely different from the old one, even though the picture hasn't changed. Now we're stuck with cereal we won't eat and can't return because it's opened.  I contacted the company to complain and asked where I could get the old formula and their response was not helpful - they didn't answer the question of where to get the no-sugar version and the response was pat - i.e., they were sorry to hear of my disappointment regarding this reform and would share my thoughts with the appropriate individuals.  This is so misguided and a perfect example of large companies getting into the organic business and managing to end up serving us junk by another name; the old product was quality, the new one is one to avoid.  While boycotting an entire company's product line is not typical for me, I am leaning toward refusing to buy ANY of their products any longer due to this change and the company's response to my inquiry; I can't in good faith buy from them when other companies are acting more responsibly."
0,"My family has loved this cereal for around 7 years or so before they ruined it. Also, the taste of the new sugar version is very poor. We have tried O's cereals without sugar from our local Whole Foods Market as well as Barbara's, but we don't really like them. For some reason, nothing stands up to the old version of Purely O's. We have now substituted Amaranth Flakes by Arrowhead Mills, which is a superior yet delicious cereal in my opinion (as well as my 2 little girls' and husband's opinions). We have abandoned O's cereals for now, not being able to really like Barbara's or WF's versions, but we will buy them if the original Purely O's cereal ever comes back. Certainly, if Cascadian Farms won't listen to its customers, then some other company should hopefully seize a great opportunity here. Especially since O's are so beloved by and wonderful for (developmentally) toddlers, who may grow to love them young, and keep them as a staple in their diet for years, perhaps for a lifetime. The opportunity for a company here is strengthened further by the huge market of devoted parents of young children who will seek out the healthiest version of O shaped cereal that their children will eat and enjoy... and will even pay a bit more for the higher quality. How we do care what we feed our precious growing tender dependent sweet little bundles of joy!"
0,"Who takes a sugarless product and suddenly adds sugar to it - without changing one speck of packaging (except the ingredients list and calorie content)?  Manipulative? Fraudulent? Stupid? Whatever the rationale, Cascadian Farm messed up big time on this one.  I'm going to avoid the cereal and the whole brand from now on unless they make a change (Remember Tropicana's rollback of their ugly new packaging?  Consumers CAN impact these corporate choices by switching allegiances)."
0,"This cereal used to be good AND have almost no sugar at all. Now the formula has changed and it looks and tastes horrible. For anyone trying to limit sugar for themselves or their kids, this is not the cereal for you. Not what it used to be. Try Barbara's O's."
0,"I *loved* that Cascadian Farms used to sell an organic version of that perfect baby finger food - Cheerios. We bought it often, but were surprised and saddened to see the latest version sneaks in added sugar. Even my 2-year-old saw the change; after eating a few he looked and me and said, ""they are sweet!"" Of course, he's still a fan, but I will not be buying these again unless CF reverts to the old (perfect!) formula."
0,"I used to like Cascadian Farms Organic Purely O'S Cereal because it had no sugar or sweetener and had been buying the cereal for my daughter for 20 months since she was 6 months old. However, the new box I just bought on Feb.13,2010 tasted different,very very sweet! I looked at the ingredients and found that the cereal now has sugar in it. I will not buy this product again. I'm very dissapointed with the new recipe!"
0,"I have been buying Purely O's for the past few years.  Yes, I was paying a premium, however it was worth it.  The ingredients were organic, these was a decent fiber content, and most importantly, there was no corn or sugar.  Recently General Mills (company that owns Cascadian Farms)decided to covertly change the formula, add a bunch of sugar and corn, and pass it off as the same cereal.  I opened the box and thought that that there was a packaging mix-up.  I thought they put the Honey O's in the Purely O's box.  I called the customer service number (which I have never done before) to let them know.  To my surprise I was told that it was not a mixup, and that they had changed the formula.  I was stunned.  I had finally found a fortified cereal without all of the junk in it that I liked.  Now it is just another overpriced mainstream sugar cereal.  Obviously General Mills is trying to maximize profits by cheapening the ingredients in their line of foods.  Poor form in my opinion.  I agree with the other reviews.  At the very least, inform people.  They have lost me as a Purely O's customer, and I question whether or not I can trust the brand in general.  Don't bother with this cereal.  It's no longer worth the premium you need to pay."
0,"I am so disappointed in Cascadian Farms or, as I've heard, now General Mills<br />I have emailed them to voice my own concern and got a response that ended with this:<br />""In keeping with our satisfaction guarantee, we would like to send you an adjustment for your purchase and it will be mailed to the address you have provided. Please allow 10-14 business days to arrive.<br />We appreciate your loyalty to General Mills and hope you continue to choose our products.<br />Sincerely,<br />Imee B. Roberts<br />Consumer Services""<br />Guess what I got? Coupons for Cascadian Farms products! ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? Why would I waste my time????<br />BTW, here are the replacements I've found and my daughter LOVES them: 1) Natures Path Kamut Puffs (Kamut is the ONLY ingredient) 2) Natures Path Rice Puffs (Rice is The ONLY ingredient) and 3) Barbara's Bakery Breakfast O's (contain corn)<br />ALL OF THESE ARE ORGANIC!!!!! The Breakfast O's are the only actual ""O's"" but my daughter has not seemed to mind as long as they are crunchy and yummy!"
1,"I'm so glad I've found a healthier alternative to Cheerios. My 18 month loves Cheerios but I wanted to find a healthier version.<br /><br />The new recipe is great. It only has 1 gram of sugar per serving and it no longer contains corn.  Last year when I first tried it, it contained 3 grams of sugar per serving. I didn't like how sweet it tasted so I stopped buying it. Then I came across a review about the new recipe so I decided to research it. Seeing the new nutritional label here on Amazon, I decided to give it another try. Glad I did. Now my only complaint is it contains more sodium than Cheerios, hence the 4 stars rating. Cheerios has 160 grams while Cascadian Farms has 190 grams per servings.<br /><br />Ingredients: *Whole Grain Oats, *Whole Grain Barley, *Wheat Starch, *Malted Barley Extract, Sea Salt, *Oats, * Malted Barley, Vitamin E (mixed tocopherols)<br /><br />Vitamins and Minerals: Calcium Carbonate, Zinc and Iron (mineral nutrients), A B Vitamin (niacinamide), Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride) A B Vitamin (folic acid)"
1,"I just ordered the 4-pack of this cereal and on the front of the box they advertised a new formulation and 1 gram of sugar. Ditto on the nutritional panel. I suppose the backlash resulted in them dropping the sugar content.<br /><br />1 gram of sugar is just fine for my family and me. If that's too much for you, you should consider making your own cereal out of your own home-grown and home-milled grain."
0,I have never cared for sweetened cereal as I was not raised on it. When I found Purely O's a few years ago I was happy to have found a cereal that did not contain sugar or corn products which I need to avoid because of a corn allergy.  I had intended to buy another box today. I took the time to read the label to make sure that nothing had changed. I could not believe that the ingredient list now lists CORN!  I am so angry!  Purely O's were my go-to breakfast when I needed a something quick or was in the mood for cereal.  There is nothing that this  company makes that I can now eat.  When will these people learn humans aren't pigs! Everything in a supermarket should not contain corn!  If I had wanted corny oat cereal I would have bought Cheerios.
0,Totally false advertising.  The advertisement says PACKAGE OF FOUR!!! But you will receive 3 boxes!  What a ripoff.  Paid for 4 pack and receive 3.  Do not trust them and order elsewhere!
0,"It used to be great. My older son went through a truckload of these before they changed the formulation, added sugar and basically made it to be junk food. Whole foods has recently introduced a product that reminds me of old purely o's. Not quite the same but close."
0,"This used to be a great cereal, the only organic ""O""s cereal with the same taste, texture and mouth-feel as Cheerios.  The latest box I bought had a sweet coating that ruins the taste and feel.  Won't buy this again."
0,"I AM SO PISSED OFF!!  this used to be ""purely o's"", as in NO SUGAR and only wholesome ingredients.  now?  sugar and molasses and fillers!  the VERY LEAST they could have done was written, ""lightly sweetened"" or some other sort of pseudo-honest marketing to let us know that they had changed their formula/recipe.  instead, i order a carton of 4 boxes only to find that these are ""purely crap""!!!  no thanks Cascadian Farms!  you can keep your new cereal that is no better than every other box of sweetened crap out there!"
0,"The texture is bad: light as if there is no substance and the cereal gets soggy in milk very fast.  there is not much taste(at least there is no good taste that i can notice).  compared to the health valley cereals, this cereal would deserve only one star if it weren't for the ok nutrition facts."
1,"What is WRONG with America!???<br />Why add all the sugar.<br />Spoon it on top if you want but<br />kids are eating too much sugar already,dont<br />put it in!!!"
0,"These lemon drops are OK.<br />First, they don't have a very strong lemon flavor, and you may like that. I like lemon and i want to pucker up.<br />Second, these babies are rough in your mouth. Lots of sugar to get through before you hit lemon.<br />Third, they are all beat up in a bulk bag, which doesn't make them very nice to put in a candy dish."
1,"yummy! great price in bulk! They are a bit tart, the shape is similar to football, texture is good -absolutely delicious!"
1,My favorite nuts and they are also healthy. By time the recall list on these came out they were already digested by me.
1,"We bought a 4-pack of these when Amazon was having a special of saving $25 when buying $59 or more.  After the savings, these ended up being something like $4 a pound -- which is a great price for Pistachios!  After receiving the first bunch, we ate the first bag in no time and gave away a couple for holiday gifts.  When we were down to the last bag, my wife wanted more -- so we ordered 2 more 4-pack sets and hopefully this time they'll last a little longer.  These are fresh, taste very good and at the price we paid, a real bargain."
1,I have purchased these nuts a couple times. They are not the best money can buy but they are the best you can buy for the money.
1,THE PACKAGE ARRIVED ON TIME. THE PISTACHIOS ARE THE SAME AS I BY IN-STORE BUT THE CHEAPER PRICE MADE THEM EVEN MORE DELICIOUS!!!
1,These pistachios are a ton better than you can get at Trader Joe's. High quality and great taste.
1,"These were the best, and somehow fresher-tasting, that we have enjoyed, yet!  A good buy!"
1,"My dogs love these and the smaller pieces are more appropriate for my little terrier than a whole pig's ear.  I also like to avoid raw hide since one of my previous dogs had stomach problems with raw hide.  I haven't noticed any issues with the ear pieces.<br />After looking at grocery and the pet store chains, this is a good price in comparison. I paid about $12 for the pound of Grillerz."
1,"This keeps my dog (a dedicated chewer) happy for at least 2 hours each, and he's always going back for more.  There is a decent amount of meat left on it, that breaks down easily.  It's well cured, and clean.  Smells a little smokey, but much better than other products I've found.  It's my border collie/shepherd mix's favorite treat!"
1,"Wonderful flavor(s). Perfect for electrolyte replacement in heat and post-workouts. I heartily recommend it.  Try the citrus flavor.  Grapefruit...very unusual, different and oddly fantastic.  Unexpected, unique and as I said Yummy!"
1,The power citrus berry is the best flavor of all.  It is so hard to find.  I just want to be able to find enough to keep me supplied at all times for 2 bottles a day.
1,"I brought this up to Ohio from Texas (haven't found it in the stores up here yet).  I used it as a dip (2c sour cream + 2-3T seasoning, mix and let it sit for at least an hour), and my neighbors couldn't get enough of it.  It has just a kick of heat to it, just enough to make it addictive, and not too salty.  So glad to find it here on Amazon!  I'll be trying it as a general seasoning, too, once I get a new supply."
1,"I was very excited to find this seasoning on Amazon considering that it is not sold where I currently live. When I lived in New Mexico, I used this seasoning in everything! I kept it right next to the salt and pepper because it is so versatile. I am very excited to use it again!"
1,"I use them to make fillers for dumplings and ravioli, I mix a can with a little wasabi mayo for a shrimp salad sandwich, I sprinkle the little guys on a salad (there is no chemical taste that you can sometimes get with canned seafood) ... there are a hundred great uses for these canned shrimp, and that makes me especially glad that they are responsibly harvested.  I am very pleased to be able to order 12 packs of this item at a bulk price."
1,"Whoa nelly I love this stuff! WOW.<br /><br />I made myself some shrimp cocktail and devoured an entire can the first day... drank the remaining yummy juice...mmmmm!<br /><br />Now I'm addicted to a shrimp cocktail appetizer and then I dump the rest of these guys into a rice/cream-of-shroom/lemonjuice concoction that's out of this world. The remaining shrimp broth is perfect for drinking but I like to spice up my cat's meals with it since she seems to like it too :p<br /><br />I did not expect to love this that much... not sure what I expected but I thought it would be difficult, at a minimum, to make it through a can per meal. Nope... there's plenty per can but I can't stop myself. I think it will refrigerate well (not sure for how long) especially when prepared in other dishes.<br /><br />But I've already caught myself doing the math on how I'll afford to eat this every day or every other day -- at least for as long as my obsession lasts. O' Wild Planet wild shrimp: I CAN'T QUIT YOU.<br /><br />I am so very happy with this product!<br /><br />THANK YOU!"
0,"To be completely honest, at my house we did not like this shrimp at all ... nope, not at all (shudder). So I tried to send it over to my sister, but after she sampled it she said even her cat wouldn't eat it.  We thought about sending it to a food bank for homeless people but decided against that so as not to disappoint anyone there.  Never again, I swear, never again ... :("
1,I must say these are as good a canned shrimp as I have had.  Some others seem to have an after taste.  These do not.  The texture also seems to be firmer.  I will continue to regularly order these.
1,"I love Wild Planet and what they stand for.  The shrimp are good, but I've had better salad shrimp.  However, the tuna is fantastic.  In an age where everything is farm raised, Wild Planet is offering an excellent product at a good value."
1,This is the only canned shrimp I have ever tasted that did not have that funny metal aftertaste from being canned. I will be buying this over and over.
1,"Terrific taste-far superior to most canned brands.  In a salad, or what ever- your preference,this brand is a winner...No chemicals to cause allergic problems (my predicament),or other trauma!....Adapt to reality and please,please thrive!....I don't care if you are a right or left wing nut job,just do well with these products,and get well enough to tell me that I'm a maniac right-wing crazie...All I care about (at my age 63) is that gals feel good(and look good) without the creepy chemicals...the hell with the chemicals-and the hell with the political aspersions...get well,baby!...."
1,"This is a serious shipment of Swedish Fish. Hefting these bags out of the box is a lot like standing on the slippery desk of a schooner in the Baltic sea.. except.. well, like with sugar water instead of salt water.<br /><br />Anyway these are nice soft (as in fresh-ish) Swedish Fish. There's even some stray piece of other candy from a factory, it looks like maybe a Sour Patch Kid or something, in the bag I haven't opened yet. Which totally lends to the illusion of a big net-full just reined in from the bottom of that sugary, sugary Baltic.<br /><br />This will keep my visitor cup running-eth over of Swedish Fish at the office for the winter.. and hopefully will not promote my pants size. If you were going to eat this many Swedish Fish, you'd need to order like some kind of Kama Sutra of ways to eat Swedish Fish to go with it. This is a massive haul of the good old chewy fellas, of the large variety. My only complaint is that it isn't like 100 pounds instead of 10 pounds. Ahoy."
1,"We bought two orders of these -- twenty pounds of red Swedish Fish!!!!  It was a little stunning to see the little guys in such quantity!  We're bagging them up in little sparkly tulle bags with silver ribbons for my daughter's upcoming wedding to a Swedish man, hence the massive purchase.  Anyway, they arrived promptly, they were packaged securely, they're delicious and chewy (we had to sample them!), and this was the cheapest place that we found.  Thanks!"
1,"Ten pounds is a lot of candy, but $3 a pound is a good price for these. The bags are not re-sealable, so be prepared to re-package them, if not intended for use all at once.<br /><br />They are soft and fresh.<br /><br />Please note that they are the standard, large-size fish, not small ones as it appears in the photograph."
1,"I bought this back when it was $26 and free shipping.  What a great deal!  I'm still not through the second bag!  A little less chewy then normal, but that doesn't diminish the flavor.  A great value!"
1,"I have a sister who is crazy about Swedish fish, so I decided to get her a 1 gallon candy jar and fill it with fish for her birthday.  I wasn't sure how many fish it would take to fill a gallon jar, so I went with this package, thinking that it should at least fill most of it.  I was pleasantly surprised when the fish arrived and just one of the two included bags was enough to fill the jar almost entirely!  I was able to give my sister the full jar with a nicely packaged refill.  I'll most likely be buying this package again in the future, great bang for the buck."
1,"These were a gift to my daughter in Texas.  She loves them and they are hard to find (Red)!!!  They came in perfect condition, fresh and chewy.<br /><br />Thank you"
1,I bought this package of Swedish Fish as a Christmas gift. The person I had gotten this for LOVES Swedish Fish. I bought him a 1 lb bag last year and he finished it in a few hours. His kids helped of course.<br /><br />Well....this year there will be noooo way they'll finish 10 lbs in one night (I hope). There will be PLENTY to take home.<br /><br />They arrived a little frozen due to the weather but they're GREAT and the price ($30) was right! FREE shipping on this heavy item was an A+++ and the reason I made my purchase.<br /><br />I can't wait to give it to him!!!
1,"Go Big or Go home.  This is 10lbs of Swedish Fish.  My daughters friend is addicted to them, so as a pleasant joke for Christmas I ordered this 10lb deal.  It is going to be fabulous."
0,"There selling 2 5lb bags for 50 dollars, get a sams club mebership where they sell 3.5 lb bags for 4.00 flat. so it will only cost you 12 dollars for 10.5 lbs, and then for shipping ya right they want to charge you up the ass when they could easily fit it into a flat rate box. this deal is obsered, they dont have ak prices online but heres the price of sweedish fish in idaho"
1,"This is a very thick, richly flavored honey. Probably the best I have ever tried. In my opinion, it's good enough to give as a gift."
1,I kind of liked these and my granddaughter loved because they were also cute. My 32 yr old boys who love gummis did not like the foam on these.
1,"We needed a themed snack for a book club meeting, and these were a big hit. Shipment came fast, product as pictured."
1,The trick is to make the box last awhile.  I save these for special treats.
1,I am a Heath bar freak and unable to find my favorite candy bar in my small town the luxury of ordering it through Amazon was fantastic. There is nothing like an entire box of Heath Bars showing up at my door to make me one happy camper.
1,"These are a favorite candy treat but, for some reason, unavailable in local stores.  Delivery was in good time."
1,I was a bad girl.  Love a Heath Bar I do.  Amazon service is always great.
0,"So I love Heath bars. Probably my favorite candy bar. I stick one in my otherwise healthy lunch almost every day, which also makes these 24 count boxes amazing. The thing is... the price here ($24.87 at the time of this review, and I've always seen it around this price) is absolutely ridiculous! Save your money and go to Sams or Costco and get two of these boxes for the same price plus a little left over for gas money. I'm kinda disappointed that Amazon even lets this happen."
0,"These peanuts are OK.  They are obviously far better than most ""store-bought"" brands (such as Planter's).  However, they are nowhere NEAR as tasty as the peanuts I've ordered from Amazon which are produced by the Peanut Shop of Williamsburg.  Plus, the ""blisters"" in the Virginia Diner brand seem to be mostly broken in half (i.e., not intact), and they are actually somewhat hard to bite into.  For a few extra dollars, the additional investment in the Willamsburg variety is well worth it."
1,We have ate at the Virginia Diner and the food is great. We wanted more nuts but not the drive and this product was great as well. Price was reasonable and delivery right on time. Such good quality.
1,These peanuts are delicious but the price really went up!  I just ordered them in March and the price went up by about 7 or $8.00!  Very disappointed!
0,"I would never buy these peanuts again.  The're as crunchy in as almost tasting stale.  No peanut taste at all!  If you like VERY crunchy peanuts, maybe you might like them....not me. If you're ever in Jupiter Florida come by my house and I will give you both 32 oz. cans!"
1,"First discovered these peanuts over 20 years ago in a small shop in Oxford Maryland, and I have been enjoying them ever since.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />There may be better peanuts out there, but it can't be too many.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />PS If you own a boat, you may already know Oxford."
1,"These are great peanuts, big, crisp, fresh and yummy.  The only thing I could possibly say in the negative is that the packaging is a bit inconvenient.  The lid is difficult to remove unless you use like a knife or something and then you can't really put the lid back on unless you always have the instrument with you.  Other than the lid issue this is a delicious product at a good price."
1,To my taste and to the tastes of several out of state friends there are no better peanuts to be found.  Salted or not. Always try to keep some on hand and usually stocked up when near tha actual diner.  Now will probably keep ordering via z<br />amazon. Same great quality and a better price!
1,"We use to get Virginia peanuts from family up there, and this was the first year that I bought online and from this company.  The virginia gourment peanuts were exactly what we expected.  We will be purchasing these again."
1,"Peanuts. These nuts are my favorite nut ever. Yes, surpassing my old Number 1 nut 'Mauna Loa garlic onion flavored Macs'. These peanuts are that GOOD."
1,"We always thought that the Virginia peanuts we were eating were wonderful....until a friend gave us a can of Virginia Diner Gourmet Salted Virginia Peanuts.....WHAT A DIFFERENCE! ""Virginia Diner"" peanuts beat all the others ""hands down""...only kind we will eat now!......and Amazon has the best price on the web!"
1,"These are excellent, large, crunchy and lightly salted.  We are happy we can buy them from Amazon at a cheaper price with free shipping."
1,"These are just awful.  Once I puncture that vacuum-packed seal on the top and I hear that air woosh in, this entire can is usually gone in a few days tops.<br /><br />These are, without question, the best peanuts available.<br /><br />If you have no willpower (like myself) do yourself a favor and don't buy these."
0,"Having just visited Pat O'Briens in New Orleans, I immediately ordered some of this mix to enjoy at home.<br /><br />I prepared it exactly according to the directions, including the use of good-quality dark rum (Myer's).<br /><br />It was good, but NOTHING like the Hurricanes we had on Bourbon Street.  The taste of an authentic Hurricane was still fresh in my mind (having enjoyed, um, several of them), and I found this mixer overly sweet and heavy, and only vaguely familiar.  It was like rum mixed with Hawaiian Punch if the punch was more syrupy.<br /><br />It was good, but not authentic.  It seems the only way to enjoy an authentic Hurricane is to spend $7.50 for one at Pat O'Briens on Bourbon Street."
1,"Since I reached my late 20's I started getting increasingly<br />worse hangovers. Even after only a few drinks.<br /><br />This is a major bummer because I like to kick back on the<br />weekends and have a few cocktails or beers. And occasionally<br />during the week I'll have a glass of wine. And on very rare<br />occasions I'll throw down a few shots and just flat out rage.<br /><br />I expect to get a hangover when I rage. But not when I<br />have just a few drinks. It's a total bummer.<br /><br />That's why I was pretty excited to try Pre-Game.<br /><br />And after trying it, I have to say, the product works. I pop one<br />of these before I start drinking and the next morning I don't<br />have a hangover. I'm able to get out of bed and go about<br />my day feeling good.<br /><br />The little energy kick it provides is an added bonus before<br />you head out for the night and in the morning when I need<br />a little pick me up and I don't want to drink a big coffee."
1,"I've been looking for the right supplement to add to my diet to help give me extra energy without the harmful additives. Also, one that didn't taste nasty. This one tastes great with no after taste, and gives me the boost of energy I've been looking for. Worth the investment. Enjoy!"
1,"I purchased this when Amazon itself was selling them, not an outside seller. The price from them was great! This is such a nice kit. Has a nice selection of various marinades. One thing that is incorrect though is the picture shows each marinade having it's own injector syringe, but they do not. There is only one syringe, but it is easily cleaned. The dry spice was fresh and the mariandes have good expiration dates. I hope Amazon itself gets more of these in  so I can order this again. It's a great deal at the Amazon price, plus free prime shipping. The spices are flavorful but don't burn your head off...they just leave a delicious flavor in whatever you inject :-)"
1,"If you suffer from blood sugar issues and tend to get dizzy, shaky and sweaty if you don't eat I recommend this bar. It doesn't taste fantastic but it will help regulate your blood sugar and keep you from crashing. I keep a few around me most of the time, so if I don't have a chance to eat I don't go all crazy.<br /><br />I personally don't get blood sugar crashes if I exercise a few hours before I should eat.<br /><br />If I eat it during a crash, I feel kinda yucky and low energy, but the shakes etc go away."
1,"My favorite Extend Bar is the Peanut Delight, it reminds me of a ""Rice Krispies"" peanut butter treats.<br />I have trouble with my blood sugar dropping, especially in the evening or night. When I eat the Peanut Delight bar as a snack at bedtime I do not have any problem.<br />I am not a real chocolate person,if you are a chocolate person you will love the chocolate bars and the other flavors are very good too.<br />I give this product the highest recommendation that I can, try all the flavors I am sure you will love them too. The benefits for diabetic patients are great."
1,Extend bars are excellent.  We have tried two flavors.  Loved them both.  They arrived timely and in excellent condition. I plan to reorder this product to come automatically. Kathy Carnes
1,This is a great tasting bar that I eat at bedtime to control my lows. Works great. The best flavor of all the bars they make. Will definitely order more of these.
1,"In the afternoon when I need a boost to get me through work and home to dinner I have a bar and it really helps.  I don't know how they work, but they really make a difference in keeping my blood sugar stable."
1,"Extend bars are great.  I wish I knew that the peanut butter flavor has a bit less protein than the others before I bought it, but it still satisfied me and was very tasty."
0,the product features section states bar is high in fiber and low in carbs.  it's actually just the opposite with only 1g of fiber and 30g-6g(fiber and alcohol sugar) for a total of 24g carbohydrate.  way high if your on the atkins diet.
0,"CAUTION >>  Contrary to the text above, this item is NOT gluten free.  A quick check to the manufacturer's site leads to this statement: ""Our two flavors of ExtendBar Crunch not gluten-free, since they contain a very small amount of barley malt extract."""
1,"Finally, a sweetener with 0 calories, no aftertaste and it is actually GOOD for your teeth! Known to actually REVERSE dental caries.<br /><br />Single serving packets are just right for tea and coffee..."
1,This is the closest thing to sugar taste I have ever used! NO after taste!!! I only use Xylitol now in my coffee and tea YUM Love it.....
1,"My nearby grocery store carries a lot of gourmet and health-related items and I like to try them. One I picked up recently was Amy's Organic Chili. I bought both the regular and the spicy varieties and I'm reviewing the spicy one here. It's quite good for a canned chili. I'd say it's at least as good as any other canned brand. Plus it's fairly low in fat and seems to lack that oily topping I associate with canned chili. I't's a little higher in sodium than I'd like, but not by much. The taste is quite good. It's somewhat zesty but I'd rate the spicyness as mild. The meat is ground and occurs as tittle interspersed grains rather than larger chunks. Of course, it's organic. I've always liked chili and this is a good one that I can keep stashed in my pantry.<br /><br />Gsry Peterson"
1,One of the best deals I have seen for rose preserves. Great price for the quality and quantity you receive. Will purchase this again.
1,"I have three cats, and was having trouble finding a dry cat food that all three would eat in between canned food feedings, so I decided to give this one a try.  They all three love this food, and it is pretty nutritious for them, and no animal by-products.<br /><br />I've tried the Salmon flavor to, they don't seem to like it as well as this flavor, but all three eat it.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great food that most cats will like."
1,"Although it is a little pricey compared to most cat foods, my cats are worth it!  :)  Their coats have been softer and they eliminate less waste while eating this cat food.  Additionally, this is such high quality stuff (look at the ingredients!) that you don't have to feed them as much as standard ""commercial"" cat food found at a typical grocery store.  I'd say I only have to feed them 50-75% as much.  I have two cats and a 6 pound bag lasts me a little over two weeks.  And on the occasion that I did not purchase this brand (due to convenience typically), my cats are always crying and hungry because their little bodies are not fulfilled!  This is the best cat food!"
1,"I am so happy with this product it is the best coconut oil I ever had and it is so good for you as well, use it in all your cooking it is 100% colesterol free, and tastes good too !"
0,"I am on the bandwagon now of believing that coconuts along with products derived from them as being healthy. The problem is that is expensive to keep up a regular supply of coconut oil; this product was cheaper than our local health food store, though. The box arrived with oil stains on one side; it had leaked out from the packaging, so that was disappointing. It is also messy to pour it out of the very wide-mouthed container; it usually drips onto the outside of the canister. I must say that I will be sticking with extra-virgin olive oil and canola oil until the price goes down on coconut oil and more user-friendly packinging is available."
0,"The product is not quite what I expected based on the reviews and hype offered.  If it has even a hint of coconut flavor, it eludes me.  The texture is sort of like lard at room temperature.  No health benefits have been apparent after several weeks of use."
0,"I have heard about the benefits of this type of fat and so finally bought some when it was on special here.  It was still sort of expensive, but I had heard so many good things about it, I bought it.  I now have a lot of it in my pantry!  The coconut flavor is VERY strong.  I thought that perhaps it would cook off, but it does not.  Nobody liked the flavor of coconut in food  that aren't supposed to have coconut.  Therefore, I only use it when I am cooking stir fry or Asian--then it is fine, but it is A LOT of product to have around for 2 or 3 meals a month."
1,"I've tried a few different brands of extra-virgin coconut oil, and for the most part I'm equally satisfied with them all. Despite the marketing hype, coconut oil brands within each category (virgin, refined, hydrogenated) are very similar. I should specify the qualities I look for in a coconut oil: I want a coconut oil with a rich coconut aroma and taste, maximum nutrition, and minimal processing. For these reasons, I always select an organic, extra-virgin, cold-pressed oil.<br /><br />I'm pleased that this Nutiva Organic Extra-Virgin Coconut Oil provides these qualities along with an easy-to-find ""packed on"" and ""best before"" date. The jars I ordered in late January 2011 were packed on September 13, 2010, and the ""best before"" date is September 13, 2012. Stored correctly (cool, dark location, no refrigeration needed), this nutrient-dense oil stays fresh for two years. It smells and tastes great--coconutty and slightly sweet.<br /><br />According to Nutiva, no hexane is used in the processing of this oil. Hexane is a petroleum-derived solvent used in all kinds of industrial applications, from shoe manufacturing to roofing. Interestingly, because hexane's primary molecular structure is carbon, it can be passed off as ""organic."" Do a little research; ""cold-pressed,"" ""organic,"" AND ""hexane-free"" are key considerations when selecting your coconut oil for nutrition purposes.<br /><br />I'm not as pleased with the plastic jars. In fact, I took off a star as a result of the plastic packaging. I feel that a quality organic oil should be stored in a glass jar, and ideally a dark one to reduce oxidation. I've actually selected coconut oils specifically because they come in glass jars, and might have bypassed this product if I hadn't found it on sale at a good price. I put this information in the review to aid those of you who are looking for a coconut oil in a glass jar."
1,"My bf and I both have subscriptions for this coconut oil. It's a great way to get it for an AMAZING price. I used to order the larger size and I was disappointed when it was unavailable for a while and I had to order the two pack in this smaller size (although really 29 ounces is not that small) but in the end I like it much better. With two smaller ones we can each have one if we end up running out around the same time otherwise, half of the coconut oil stays fresh and unopened. Oh, and if you want to put some on right after a shower, the smaller jar is more likely to actually fit in your shower.<br /><br />We tried other coconut oils and they were...well...gross. Really rancid tasting. We use this in deep dish pizza crust and the one time we used another brand we basically ruined two giant 14 inch pizza pies. We also use it for flour tortillas, pie crust, refried beans, smoothies, coffee cake, um, all kinds of things. I am planning to try using it instead of butter in a croissant recipe, although I expect it will be quite tricky since it melts at a slightly lower temperature than butter, and gets harder when it hardens. Put it in the fridge and it is hard as a rock.<br /><br />Anyway, we now use this stuff about as much as we use olive oil, and we've found it actually showing up in recipes in some newer cookbooks now, too, rather than us just trying to substitute and seeing how it works out. It does have a strong coconut smell and flavor, which enhances some recipes in a FABULOUS way, but may be detrimental in others."
1,"This is great for baking.  I use it in place of butter for all baking at 350 degrees F.  Everyone loves my gluten-free, dairy-free brownies. The oil is hard when refridgerated (cold brownies), but liquifies above 78 degrees F., so it literally melts in your mouth. It also gives brownies a great extra sweetness. You can use it in place of butter or lard in most baking recipes. I also use it in the pancake pan and egg pan and to grease pans before baking. However, this larger-sized bottle is more expensive per oz. than the subscribe and save's other option- two smaller bottles."
1,"This is a marvelous product with some interesting health benefits (google it up). You can use it in baking, frying, in sauces, for vegan raw pies, mix with chocolate for puddings, moisturize your hair or skin, soothe rough elbows, etc.<br /><br />This melts really fast in a pan, so you don't need a high heat. I fry eggs in it, and the coconut taste is subtle. Any ethnic dish that requires sauteeing or saucing and can benefit from a fresh coconut flavor, this is useful. I've cooked meats in it, as well. If you hate the smell/taste of coconut, obviously, this is not for you.<br /><br />This brand, Nutiva, is organic and virgin. It smells so good. And I have an old jar that I never finished (really big one), and nearly two years later, after sitting right by the stove, it still smells fresh, like Cuban coconut candy my mom used to make. Yes, solid and fresh and white and fragrant TWO YEARS LATER. This is a very stable product.<br /><br />Recommended."
1,"This is the only coconut oil that I use!<br /><br />Buy it in the summer, when it is liquid. That way you can easily pour the contents into glass jars."
1,"I love this stuff!  It has a very light coconut taste.  I have it on english muffins, toast, pancakes and oatmeal in the morning. I've used instead of oil or butter in desserts.  With toast it tastes great with a little peanut butter.  I also use it on my whole body as a moisterizer and as a conditioner for my hair.  It goes on your skin a little greasy but soaks in within 5 minutes.  I no longer break out and my skin looks much clearer, much like when I was a kid.  I put it on before we went to a water park last week, and I the only place I sunburned was by my bathing suit straps where I didn't apply very well.  I will never go without this stuff on my shelves again."
1,"I had to chime in here.  I have the 29oz and have looked all over the web (including the Nutiva site) to see if they mention what plastic this container is.  Nowhere is it to be found.  There are a handful of mentions of no. 1 plastic (when it was in a clear jar).  But nothing about these white plastic jars that now seem to be the norm for most sizes.  So when I got home today I turned mine over and found a ""2"".  HDPE.  Don't have to worry about BPA but I don't know much about HDPE.<br /><br />If they carried this in a glass jar I would be happier though I would need to find at local brick and mortar stores because I am sure shipping would be a lot. Like others on account of the container, I give it a 4 star rating.<br /><br />This is the BEST EVCO I have had to date and I will continue to use it.  As for transferring it to another container: I have many Ball jars because I use a foodsaver vacuum sealer to keep things.  However, the lining of the jar lids is apparently BPA rich.  So, I will keep it in the white plastic number 2 and hope for the best.<br /><br />Again, this is a great quality EVCO and I haven't heard a single bad word about it except for the plastic jar so wanted to add what information I could for those making a decision."
1,"I got this mainly because of  all the talks about the Coconut oil as as skin moisturizer. It might sound silly to buy 2 jars of coconut oil just to use it as moisturizer, but I thought I can try it in food as well. I like the smell, as opposite to other people, though it's not strong to hurt your nose, and it disappears in few minute. Cooking in coconut oil, is like cooking in water, it does not have the same texture as olive oil, it looks watery, and it gives a nice taste to the food. Having it on your skin, it dry in couple minute leaving your skin smooth and not oily at all.I never tried coconut oil before, so I cannot compare it to other brand."
1,"Since I first discovered the Nutiva EVCO about 2.5 months ago, not only has my skin become more soft and supple, even in these winter months, but my labs and blood-work have benefited very much with the inclusion of the EFAs re-introduced back into my diet.  I see nothing but clear skies ahead, as regards my overall physical health and well-being.  Thanks, Nutiva!"
1,"I haven't found anyone who can touch the price of this product from Amazon. the quality is the best, good size because it really lasts for all of your needs. and best of all it taste great. I use it especially at night when I get the munchies, I fix myself the sugar free instant coffee and put a spoon full of the coconut oil in and it cuts my appetite and keeps me on my diet!"
1,I love this oil! It's more convenient and a fraction of the price through Amazon compared to buying from the local health food store. The quality matches the higher priced brands. A+!!
1,"Love this product.  Read in ""Nourishing Traditions"" how the lobbiest for the domestic vegetable industry try to give Coconut Oil a bad rap.  It's excellent for cooking and is great for you.  It is safe and healthy.  I recommend it highly.  Excellent taste."
1,"Nutiva coconut oil,is great in cooking, using as a moisturizer. The main reason I'm writing this is because when I first started taking about 6 mouths ago, just basically eating a good spoonful a day my blood pressure was a lot lower, I quit doing that for a while and it went back up. I started eating it again recently and have been checking my blood pressure and its lower again, which is great. Just wanted to share that."
1,"I absolutely swear by this oil. It tastes great on toast instead of butter and it is wonderful in a stir fry. It is also a great oil for your skin. It is great for the inside and outside. Try it, you will love it."
1,"I use this product strictly as a hair oil (in small quantities). As a hair oil, in African American hair(once again, in small quantities), it works wonders! Yes, it has a coconut smell, but it's a nice smell if you use it sparingly. I had two 15 ounce jars and it lasted for months! I will DEFINITELY be buying more of this!! It made my hair much softer and smoother, too!"
1,This is the only coconut oil I buy!  It is a great product and Amazon has a decent price. If you like coconut oil check out coconut flour too!  I just learned about coconut flour and I have loved baking with it.
1,The box was soaked with oil. The caps were lose. one jar was down about 1/4 of the oil . bad- bad pkg. This was purchased at amazon.
1,"When I started using coconut oil I bought a different organic brand but it tasted like soap.  Nutiva has the most wonderful smell and taste that doesn't change no matter how long you have it and it lasts forever.  I don't even buy butter anymore, I love it in my oatmeal, on popcorn and steamed veggies, as well as blending it into my morning protein smoothies."
1,"This is the best oil. Everything tastes so good when you use it, not greasy, french fries turn out golden brown and moist and fluffy inside.  I'm sure it is the oil."
1,"I am a popcorn fan, eating it around 5 times a week.  I use an old-fashioned popper, and put around 1-1/2 T coconut oil in the bottom, with 1/3 c Paragon popping corn <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YLGA0W"">Paragon Bulk Bag Yellow Corn (12.5-Pounds)</a>.  The popcorn pops up very nicely in this coconut oil (better than any other oil I've tried), and if I put a dash of fine sugar (not confectioners) on it right when it gets out of the popper, it tastes like kettle corn (aka crack corn).  If I'm feeling super indulgent, I put on a little butter topping <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VZWFZU"">Odell's Original Popcorn Butter, 10-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 3)</a>, but the coconut oil has a delightful mouthfeel even without the butter.  And just the lightest hint of coconut is present to make the popcorn seem exotic.<br /><br />I was so happy when I heard that coconut oil had just gotten a bad press a few years ago, and it's actually good for you.  Especially since it makes such amazing popcorn!"
1,"I am very pleased with this product.  Delicious.  Nice size too.  Have not yet tried it to cook, but it is very tasty just as a spread type thing.  I love coconut and am excited to be learning this maligned oil has health benefits."
1,This is a great product! It is delicious and I also use it as a hair treatment and it works great as well! its great quality and the shipment was super fast!
1,"I purchased this order so that I could make home-made soap for the holidays. I hesitated because of the price but yet I wanted a organic ""quality"" home-made soap so I clicked the buy button. When the shipment came I opened it and fell in love with the smell. I tasted it and loved the taste and was hooked. I started putting it in my oatmeal and bake goods, replaced standard oils in all my cooking--the taste was AWESOME. I also just ate some on a spoon and used it as a lotion. The first thing I noticed was my hands and lips (both were very chapped prior to using) became very soft. My husband said today how young my hands looked--and told me how his twin brother (who is single) said you can tell a lady's age by there hands and my husband said mine looks much younger (I will keep him too).  Another thing I noticed my lab-mixed dog would beg for it everytime I opened the jar. He would come running from where ever he was into the kitchen to beg. My husband broke down and feed him some, and HE LOVE IT! He has very dry skin and it seems to already help him. He now begs us for our oatmeal at breakfast. This dog has been trained not to beg but something in the oil makes him forget his training. Plus, I never heard of a dog liking oatmeal or oil. So today I will order more and give the jars as gifts and hopefully someday I will have enough left to make my soap.<br /><br />UPDATE: Gave this out as stocking stuffers and at first people were looking at me strange at such an odd gift BUT the feedback has been so positive (even got a call at 11:30 pm to tell me how yummy it was on their popcorn and it was the hit of their movie night party) and wanting to know other ways to use the oil. I was also told by someone who orders coconut oil from amazon, to order it only in the ""COLD"" months because the oil's melting point is so low and the spring/summer heat will melt the product and may leak---SO I will make sue I am stocked-up for my hot-weather needs."
1,"I cook with it and it can be used in any thing you would use oil, butter or shortening. Super healthy! Great for chapped lips, dry skin and hair too!"
1,Use it in almost all my baking and cooking now. I love the health benefits and the flavor. I also use it on my skin and hair. Very nice!
1,"My first review, yay! Just received this the other day. So far, I've spread it on crackers (yum), used it on my knees and elbows as a body lotion, and for my night lip balm which I have been looking for an alternative to vaseline ever since I heard that petroleum jelly and other non-digestible ingredients in lipgloss stays inside your system for a long time. Yuck.<br /><br />Love the taste, smell and feel of this product. A little strange to eat something that I also use for a body lotion but I don't mind too much since I love coconut everything. The only thing is that I have to be careful about eating too much of it since it's kinda high calorie (130 calories per tablespoon). Looking forward to using it on homemade popcorn."
1,"I keep a number of jars of this oil around the house.  One is in the kitchen where we use it everywhere we would use butter.  It is great on toast, corn, steamed vegetables, rice, pasta etc.  The other jar is for our skin.  It is wonderful as a bath oil and a lotion.  I put it the whole family from baby to Daddy.  It smells divine, tastes great and is super softening on the skin."
1,"I was a little worried when I got a ""JAR"" of coconut oil only to have it show up in liquid form...BUT this is totally normal and when the tempeture cools down or the air conditioner is on your Nutiva will appear solid and white...but then if it's hot as blazes like it is here in Sacramento  Ca it will be clear oil that you can actually pour out of the jar...no big deal. And if this is info you already know please excuse my ignorance.<br />the flavor, the consistency are great. I love it and use it in ALL my recipes in place of EVOO or butter...it's really healthy and has so many health benfits I can't even go into all of them.<br />all I know is my sisters red headed son with very fair skin would burn up like a crisp if she didn't put it in her meals but because of eating coconut oil he browns up like a little nut- no burns!!!!!<br />amazing!!!"
1,This coconut oil from Amazon comes at a great price.  It costs much more in stores.
1,"I read many reviews on coconut oil prior to deciding to try this one.  I was excessively pleased with the product.  The taste is very mild in the original form.  I have used it in frying things like french fries and chicken patties and find that it gives a less greasy product and a crispier product in comparison to frying with olive oil. I did not like using it with things like eggs, as there is the slightest residual coconut taste.  I have used it as a substitute in baking cookies, cakes, yeast breads, and quick breads and find the texture preferable to oil and even butter with no coconut after taste.  Would highly recommend this product and will definitely continue to purchase."
1,This coconut oil is delicious.  It has the odor and flavor of expensive organic coconut oil. I am currently using my fourth large jar of this brand.
1,"Yummo. I like coconut oil on toast, english muffins, frozen yogurt, sweet potatoes, squash, especially good on grilled Delicata squash-tastes like candy to me, veggies, etc.<br /><br />I've never had a bad tasting coconut oil yet no matter what brand. The Extra Virgin oils all taste the same to me."
1,"This coconut oil is the best!  Not only is it organic, but it is the most affordable coconut oil I have found.  I love it in baking, cooking, and as a body moisturizer.  It smells heavenly!"
1,Coconut oil from Nutiva is at a good price and is of superior quality. I love cooking eggs and vegetables with coconut oil.
1,Jarrow EVCO is becoming too expensive but other brands in its price range fell short. Nutiva is almost as good in flavor & aroma. It's at the moment more cost effective & I like that I now have options at this price point.  Good coconut flavor & aroma; my household uses it as the Primary oil for all cooking uses & as a health supplement. We go through at least 16oz per week.
1,This is our second or third order via Amazon. Love the Nutiva brand and Amazon offers a great price for this size when they run a special. One jar stays in the kitchen for cooking and baking. The other one goes upstairs for various beauty concoctions my wife makes.
1,"I received my first order a few days ago... originally bought it in the smaller, 15 oz size, thinking that I would mostly use it topically. But then I read in one of the reviews that it is great on popcorn, and decided to give it a try. It was delicious! I found myself licking the spoon- it's really true, what others have stated- the flavor is clean and fresh. Amazing! Since then, we have had it in eggs, and toast, anywhere we can... Try it in your fried potatoes- simply delicious. My dog even gets some in her food too- she loves it, and it's great for her coat!<br /><br />Of course, the way it feels on the skin is simply fantastic. A note about the ""smell"": to my nose, it does have a faint coconut odor that fades once it is applied to the skin- it is not the overwhelming- and probably synthetic- aroma that comes from sun tan lotions, or ""Skin Trip"" Lotion (for those of you familiar with it.<br /><br />As for the flavor it lends to food, I find it to be subtle, not overwhelming at all. I can't think of any foods off hand that I would not use it in- and trust me, I know my way around the kitchen... I am sure it would be delicious in baked goods as well.<br /><br />Finally, it has been mentioned in other reviews before, but I think it bears repeating: I ordered my first shipment in January. Since the melting point for this product is (I think it was) 74 degrees, it is worth noting that if you live in a hot climate, and your order is placed during summer months, I can see that there might be a higher risk of product leakage. I will definately factor that in when it comes to re-ordering.<br /><br />Oh, and speaking of re-ordering, I guess I do have one more thing to add: If you are considering which size to get, consider: I ordered the 15 oz (x2) pack, and realized that I will need to order a MUCH larger size next time, as I will be using this for cooking and lotion, etc. If you are just planning to use topically, then I am sure that the 15oz size will be perfect to start!<br /><br />Enjoy! We are thrilled with this product, and will order again soon!"
1,I have done a ton of research to find an Organic substitute for butter and margarine. I do not use either to cook at home with. I came across this product in a search and checked the USDA website to ensure this was in fact organic coconut oil to be used for cooking and other methods. I use it all the time now that I have done my work on making sure it was a proper substitute. The benefit of this product has been amazing and does not give a bad taste to any food I use it with.
1,Never thought I'd buy this online but can't beat the price. Same stuff as in the grocery store at 1/2 the price.
1,"Great oil, love the subtle coconut taste, very healthy for you just do the research on Google, and it makes the best popcorn you can think of. Give it a try. I was hesitant to give it a go since I am not a big fan of coconut as a flavor, but once I tried it I was hooked."
0,"I've tried a few different kinds of coconut oil. This is average I'd say. The reason I give it 2 stars is the packing. And the quantity.<br /><br />First, the seals were intact on both jars in the 2-pack that I ordered. But there was coconut oil all over the inside of the box, covering the jars, and even on the shipping label. Again, the seals were intact and the jars had no cracks, so I'm not sure why it was all over the place. The white plastic jar lids that covered the seals were both cracked because there was no padding in the large box that it came in. So this was probably from everything rolling around.<br /><br />Now as far as quantity - both jars had huge gaping spaces in the middle. I couldn't see this until the jar was partway gone. Coconut oil is a soft solid at room temperature. It was like the sides and bottom were covered with oil to make the jar look full and then some was squeezed in on top. Both jars were like that. I submitted a shipping complaint and no one responded. You can do better with another product. This is a little cheaper but you are asking for a mess."
0,"I purchased the 54 oz jar and it was leaking when I received it.  It took about 2 weeks to receive with the free shipping. I just kept it and used it.  Then I ordered the 2-29oz jars and they were leaking and seal broke.  I called costumer service and they told me to discard and they would send me a new order.  Then I got an e-mail saying I needed to return the item.  So I called costumer service and they cleared up the issue.  When I received the new product, it was also leaking.  I just kept it and used it.  I have never received this product without it leaking."
1,I love this coconut oil.  It smells good and tastes good.  I use it for a substitute for butter and shortening in some recipes.  I also use it for my baby instead of diaper cream.  It works wonders!  I also use it as a moisturizer for my skin and hair.  I would recommend this product to everyone.
1,"FABULOUS PRODUCT. DELICIOUS. GREAT SUBSTITUTE FOR BUTTER AND OTHER UNHEALTHY FATS.<br />ACTUALLY TASTES BETTER AND MUCH HEALTHIER. LOVE IT ON POPCORN & SWEAT POTATOES.<br />UNBELIEVABLE SPREAD ON WHOLE WHEAT TOAST SPRINKLED WITH ORGANIC COCONUT SUGAR.(ANOTHER GREAT PRODUCT)<br />ALSO, A GREAT MOISTURIZER WITH A WONDERFUL AROMA. LOVE IT! BEST FIND EVER!"
1,"The best oil I have ever cooked with. It's light and smells wonderful when the oil starts heating up. My children ask me every time I cook what is this nice smell. The coconut taste is almost unnoticable once you're done cooking. I cooked meat balls and pork chops with it. It does have ever so slight taste of sweetness that can be corrcted with a dash of sea salt, but other than that it's great and it's the healtiest oil there is out there. I most certinly did my research on the topic."
1,"This is my first experience with coconut oil, and I love it! Quality product, and love the 2-29 oz sized jars. Nice coconut flavor and fragrance. Have used it to bake breads, and brownies, and I use it before going to bed to moisturize dry, cracked heels."
1,"I have tried different coconut oil brands, but this one takes the cake! It tastes very light and fresh. The texture is smooth and creamy. And it is organic. I am really impressed."
1,"I highly recommend Nutiva brand organic seeds, oils, etc. and their Organic Coconut Oil is great.<br /><br />The Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil through Amazon Prime is a great price - especially with Subscribe and Save (note for newbies to Subscribe and Save - it is totally no risk as you can cancel and reschedule to suit your preference, plus Amazon always gives plenty of advance notice via email that your Subscribe and Save item is up for renewal / shipping).<br /><br />As more and more people are realizing these days, healthy fats are important for a healthy endocrine system / hormone production  / hormone balance, and coconut oil is one such oil.<br /><br />I originally began to incorporate coconut oil into my diet because I had read that coconut oil helps to reduce and eliminate candida.  I did find that with the incorporation of the Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil into my diet, my sugar cravings radically decreased, and my candida levels dropped to very, very low levels within a month. (I also switched to using stevia, and very seldom use honey, or maple or agave syrups - probably less than once a month.)  While I did make other dietary changes to eliminate candida, I feel that it is the coconut oil that made the greatest contribution to that end.<br /><br />Primarily I use Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil in my morning smoothies - both fruit and green smoothies.  In the winter I heat it as slightly as possible - i.e., I don't leave it sitting on the flame - to melt it so that it blends well into the smoothies and gives the smoothies a very nice, thick consistency.  In the warmer months this is no issue as the oil stays liquid and I use it straight from the container.  I am not a big fan of cooking with coconut oil, as I don't seem to be able to get it to prevent foods from sticking.  So I just add the oil to my smoothies most mornings, or to dishes after they are cooked rather than using it to saute / etc.  I have also used it in baking and finds it works very well.<br /><br />The Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil has a very light, clean and fresh taste.  Though I cannot ever detect the slight coconut flavor in the smoothies I make, I do sometimes taste it in cooked foods - but, again, it is a very mild coconut flavor, and I keep that in mind when adding it to recipes.<br /><br />I have been buying the two pack of Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil through Amazon's Subscribe and Save for about a year, and am very pleased with both the savings and service I receive through the Subscribe and Save service as well.  I have ordered during the summer and winter months without any problems with leakage during the warmer months when the oil ships in liquid form due to the higher temps. Nor have I ever had a problem with the Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil being rancid ordering through Amazon Subscribe and Save.<br /><br />Other Nutiva products I use and recommend are:  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012C7VLG"">Nutiva Organic Shelled Hempseed, 3 Pound Bag</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012C7VLG"">Nutiva Organic Shelled Hempseed, 3 Pound Bag</a> Please note, however, that the I last bought the 3 pound size of Nutiva Organic White Chia Seeds, which is no longer available through Amazon Prime - but I have not found a distinguishable difference between the white and black chia seeds whatsoever.  Also, the 3 pound size of the Nutiva White Organic Chia Seeds I bought through Amazon Prime was about one fourth the price of the 3 pound size of Nutiva Organic Chia Seeds offered by other sellers on Amazon at the time I posted this review - so be sure and compare prices!"
1,"I was skeptical but when I received the package and had my first taste, all I can say is ...wow ... absolutely delicious."
1,"I am a 'butter lover'. I had to have butter on everything. Heard about coconut oil,tried it. OMG! Now I can't live without it. I use it for everything even to make garlic bread. Its the best. You have to try it to believe it. I am on auto shipment. I even have my kids and husband eating it on toast, eggs, and all their meats. They cant even tell."
1,"I use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E1MI"">Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 29-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)</a>in most of my cooking now. It is cold pressed and is healthier than  other oils. It gives cookies, brownies, vegetables, eggs,smoothies a slightly sweet taste. Love this product. I use one jar per month on average. Amazon pricing better than at the local grocery."
1,"When I first began learning of the benefits of coconut oil, I was shocked.  Now coconut oil is my go-to product of choice - cooking, health, beauty, first-aid.  My husband laughs because I always say ""put some coconut oil on .... (whatever is ailing at the moment).<br /><br />Nutiva makes a great coconut oil product. The aroma is delicious, and the taste (raw) is exactly as coconut should taste.  I use it for almost all our baking and cooking oil needs.  When I heat this oil, I find the coconut flavor disappears, i.e. my breads, cookies, veggies, etc. don't taste like coconut.<br /><br />My only complaint about this product is that it comes in a plastic container.  However, I've been buying this brand and product (different sizes on Subscribe & Save, depending on the price at shipping) for two years and don't plan on changing any time soon."
1,"I have been on Nutiva since April 1,2012.I have heard many testimonies about it.I even give 2-tbl spoons a day to my dogs who really like it.I put it in my oatmeal,coffee,yogurt.I am hoping it will help my wt and one of my dog's wt.As well as my cholesterol and thyroid.But it's too early to tell.I have read it could take up to 6mos for any verifiable conclusions.But I am willing to see what happens. Also,if ordering this product from outside AZ,make sure they are glass containers or are sealed better.Because when they reach AZ which is hotter right now,the virgin coconut oil will have alredy turned to liquid form,and may leak thru the plastic which was the case. Greg"
1,"such a great product!  it is so yummy!  I love that it has a hint of sweet to it but is super healthy.  the otherday I made pancakes with it and forgot to add sugar, i didn't even taste a difference.  I would highly reccomend this product."
1,"I've been using this brand of coconut oil, in various packaging and sizes, for about 4-5 years now. I keep a little in a jar in my bathroom as my sole face lotion. We use it on babies' bottoms, in cooking, and more. I've been very happy with the quality of Nutiva CO and it's my go-to brand."
1,my sister turned me on to this brand and quality.  I have been using it in cooking my morning eggs and for a body moisturizer.  It takes a few minutes but a wonderful opportunity to slow down and appreciate how and why I take care of myself mindfully.  You will not be disappointed!
1,"I have read up on all the benefits on coconut oil and I like to have it in my house at all times. I try to take 3 spoonfuls a day but sometimes I get lazy. Out of all the oils I drink this one is the best. I'm not saying its delicious but if you hold your breath and drink it, it taste like nothing. When you put it on your skin it brings out a nice glow to it and it looks nice. I'm a guy with moderate acne, mainly scars and its seems to lighten them but only when on. This is a great buy as it comes with 2 jars which is nice to know I won't have to order soon."
1,"I love cooking with this brands high quality coconut oil. It is more stable at higher temperatures than EVOO. And it has been studied when add to foods 3x per day to Alheimers patients, that there was a measurable improvement in cognative functions. Who could ask for more."
1,This coconut oil has a great flavor and wonderful odor.  I bought it to eat but I have been using it on my skin too.  Much superior to the cheap one I purchased at a large chain discount store.  This one is a bit expensive but worth it.
1,"Excellent for cooking, imparts a nice fragrance and a slight coconutty taste (very subtle).  Nutiva has been my favorite brand for virgin coconut oil. I haven't had a bad batch yet."
1,"This product, tastes good, smells good and is stable in high temp for frying. It is organic and may possess several health benefits. The price is right at Amazon. Shipment and delivery is quite fast. Highly recommended."
1,"A friend recommended Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil to me.  I have been delighted to use it in cooking,  on a.m. toast, and as a night cream too.  I also recently read that it is being investigated as a possible cure for Altzheimers.  I have already spread the word about it to other friends.  ^j^"
1,"This is an amazing product. I use it as a face cleanser--it leaves my skin so soft, I put it in my coffee for coconut flavor and in my scrambled eggs because it is so beneficial to the body--antiviral, anti fungal, etc., I rub it on my feet and legs to relieve diabetic muscle cramps. It is a medium chain fat and therefore does not store fat the way other oils do. You can use it in food in place of other oils. It is going to be a staple in my house. (My mom was having an allergic reaction to meds on her skin and we rubbed coconut oil on it and within mins it went away!!!! Also, after having blood drawn I had a big bruise on my arm which as a diabetic would take many months to go away, well I rubbed coconut oil on it and it was gone in about four days!!)."
1,The Coconut Oil arrived well within the time allotted. I use it daily in my coffee along with sugar free cocoa powder. Very tasty.
1,"I recently started seeing an acupuncturist, and among many other changes in my life she suggested, she recommended that I begin using coconut oil as a regular part of my diet. She recommended Nutiva, and although it might be more expensive, it is the highest quality and best tasting. I use this for everything and it really does have a great taste. It's also replaced my night cream, and I now use it as a regular part of my skin care!! I cannot recommend this brand more! If you are thinking about what kind of coconut oil to buy, start here FIRST."
1,"this oil is a good value for the price, but definitely not the cheapest extra virgin coconut oil on amazon. So I'm docking it 1 star for that. Probably should take another star, because: It has a mild roasted flavor. So I'm a bit concerned as to how much heat goes into the processing that it achieves a roasted flavor??? I also had some family smell the coconut oil, and the first thing they said was it smells like roasted coconut. Bear in mind, this is the first time I've used coconut oil. I was a little concerned how cooked foods would taste, but to my surprise it wasn't that bad. It wasn't that strong of a coconut flavor that was added to the foods, I have fried chicken & shrimp, tasted just fine & healthy. I have some centrifuged coconut oil on the way, will review and compare soon."
1,"This product is awesome. Coconut oil has a lot of health benefits; you can use it as a skin moisturizer, you can cook with it. It will not turn black in the pan no matter the temperature. It even gives a sweet flavor to food. I purchase the same quaility in a health food store for $15 @ 16oz. So this buy is a steal for as much as I use it."
1,"Pure, fresh with mild coconut scent and very slight flavor. Product arrived in good condition in clean containers with no leaking as suggested in another review.  Everything was as it was advertised.  I have used the oil in cooking and like a buttery spread.  Pleased with the price and product."
1,"This is the best coconut oil I have tried.  Mild coconut flavor, but not overbearing.  Wonderful texture.  Great for cooking (eggs, meat, whatever) and for adding to coffee (1 Tablespoon).<br /><br />I learned about coconut oil when I moved to a low-carb / Paleo diet last year.  Coconut oil is a staple for me, and the Nutiva Extra Virgin cold-pressed is the only one I buy.  Good enough to eat straight from the jar!"
1,"This is the first time we have bought this item and we were very pleased with the product.  It arrived quickly and was exactly as described.  It comes in 2 big sealed plastic jars.  I prefer having this shipped in a plastic jar rather than glass so this was perfect.  The product is very white, very slight coconut smell and very, very slight coconut taste.  We have used it for cooking several time so far and like the results.  When we have finished using the 2 jars we will be purchasing again."
1,"I will never use Crisco again. It fries great. It's also a<br />fantastic non-greasy moisturizer. It's cholesterol free, NATURAL and smells great. Coconut oil also has lots of  medical benefits, Google it. I'm sure you will love it."
1,I have bought several different brands and to me this is my favorite.  I love the smell and can eat it by the spoon full.  And even though it has a pleasant slightly coconut flavor it doesn't mess with other flavors when you cook with it.  Once I found this I quit looking else where.  I am satisfied.  I have been using this for a couple of years.
1,"I love this Coconut oil!! I use it everyday for cooking.<br /> It has a very slight coconut taste and scent which might bother some people but I think it adds to the flavor and makes my food more enjoyable. I have added some to my peanut butter for a tasty spread, added some to smoothies, as well as using it instead of butter in baking.<br />I had the smaller containers on the subscription plan but I decided to change over to the larger 29 oz 2-pack.<br />My friends are always asking for a sample to try so it seems to disappear fast!!<br />I also use some of the Coconut oil as a conditioning treatment for my hair and skin when I feel it needs it. We heat with a wood stove during the winter and my skin can get very dry.<br />I highly recommend this product."
1,This is my first stab at buying organic coconut oil. I am very happy with it overall. It is a better buy than other places I have seen. It has a very light taste. I have used it for cooking and for baked goods. I have even eaten it on toast.
1,"It tastes great. I've only used it as a supplement and not in cooking. Also, Some people had given concerns over packaging, but mine was completely fine."
1,"I use this coconut oil anytime I am baking and it adds a slight coconut flavor. I like it much better than using a regular veg oil, plus coconut oil is so much better for you."
1,"I originally ordered this oil for my 100 year old mother after reading online a case study by Dr. Mary Newport based on research on coconut ketones to reduce the loss of cognitive function and memory in conditions like Alzheimers and, potentially, Parkinsons and MS.  When the oil arrived I gave it a taste test to be sure my mother would find it palatable.  Wow!  This coconut oil is out-of-this-world delicious.  It has a delicate but rich nutty flavor of coconut.  I could literally eat spoonfuls out of the jar.  I have so far resisted that temptation, but I always lick the spoon with which I have scooped it out of the jar.  I do not eat dairy, but when I have a glass of soy milk (Costco's organic vanilla) I heat it in the micro and whisk a tablespoon of coconut oil into it.  The price is excellent, and even better if you subscribe, which I did immediately."
1,"I've purchased this brand before. It's nutritious and delicious. We use it to cook veggies and add a subtle coconut flavor, and also in place of butter in some baked goods."
1,Tastes great and it has become the only cooking oil I use. It can even be used cold to top salads and such. Helps reduce weight as well!!!  Shame it costs so much but it is worth it!!!!!
1,Love this product and LOVE that Amazon offers it as part of the Subscribe and Save program. So much less expensive than my local store and so convenient.
1,"it just tastes great. Really loving it!  But I really like the flavor and scent of coconut.  It doesn't really make food taste like coconut, it just gives it a slight coconutty scent."
1,"Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil is delicious on toast. It's a great alternative to butter or any other spread.  It also has a lot of nutritional value.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E1MI"">Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil, 29-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)</a>  I highly recommend it."
1,"i use this coconut oil for oil pulling of teeth and gums.<br />works great.<br />whitens teeth, soothes gums.<br />remove bacteria from tongue."
1,"By far, the best price for this product.<br />I do not like the taste or smell of coconut.  However, this coconut oil is fabulous. It cooks well, it blends well.  It feels great on your skin."
1,Delicious and so great for you.  Using it on anti-candida diet and also for my husband to have extra calories.  Great price on Subscribe and Save - highly recommend.
1,"We like organic coconut oil for some cooking uses, and I like being able to get it from Amazon (subscribe & save) rather than a separate site with separate shipping & handling. It's a good value and a good product."
1,"Coconut oil is delicious in fudge.. my recipe calls for the coconut oil and the blue agave necter...yum yum.  I use it for frying my battered eggplant; makes an interesting combo. Makes fantastic skillet toast.  Just let your imagination go to work.  It is extremely healthy for you...just google it and learn of the many things that are a 'positive' for the body.  This is one item that has become popular in recent years that I am delighted to have discovered....whatever size you try first, you should not be disappointed."
1,I like this brand of coconut oil. It is great to cook with and gives a slight coconut flavor to the food or baked good.
1,"The people that say something negative about Coconut Oil, Flour or any good Coconut product Simply Are Uninformed!!! Read about everything good it does for you from the high fiber that is Very Healthy, the Good Omega 3's that your body just doesn't get enough of and So Much More....<br /><br />It has been used in Ayurvedic herbalism for 4,000 years.  Add a little Coconut Oil or 1 or 2 tablespoons Coconut Flour to your Blender drinks. A couple tablespoons per day adds lot of fiber & much more to your diet and help with food cravings.<br /><br />Recent Research has shown the Saturated fats in Coconut Oil are a unique type of fat composed predominately of medium-chain triglycerides. That type of fat is completely different than fat found in meat and other vegetable oils and has a number of health benefits. It protects against Heart Disease and Stroke and research has shown that medium-chain triglycerides also possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.<br /><br />Do yourself a ""FAVOR"" and buy the Cooking with Coconut Flour by Bruce Fife N.D. while it's still available from Amazon. Borders says it's out of print. No Wonder, People are too busy Killing Themselves with all of the good Modern Day Fast Foods, AKA Convenience Foods... That says a lot !<br /><br />IF you want to lose weight with a LOW Carbohydrate Item and Get Healthier at the same time learn about Coconut and all it's Benefits AND How To Properly Use It!!!. Or Else, Ignore This, Go Buy a Cheeseburger & Fries, & gain some More weight before you die. The Cooking w/ Book says Coconut Flour ( Oil & Coconut) are good for Diabetics and overweight individuals. So much to tell about the benefits of Coconut and my fingers are tired of typing. Please do yourself a favor and Buy The Book.<br /><br />Another Book to try is by Cherie Calbom: The Coconut Diet: The Secret Ingredient That Helps You Lose Weight While You Eat Your Favorite Foods (Paperback) on Amazon $11.16<br /><br />Compare what the benefits are against any negatives you may perceive You See Coconut has NO Gluten, NO Carbs, is a High Fiber, Low Glycemic Food, Helps to Regulate Blood Sugar that is all So Good For You!!!!!!<br /><br />ENJOY!!!<br /><br />UPDATE: 12/7/09.  You have heard the Old Adage, ""All Things In Moderation"" I still Believe this to be an Excellent Product and one of the Highest Quality, However, one of my newly acquired books on foods and inflammation rates this as a ""high -"" OR ""High Minus"" which basically says that it needs to be combined properly with other foods to keep everything in Balance. The foods rated with a Minus  - are going into the inflammatory end of the rating while the ones rated with a Plus + are going into the Positive end of the scale which do not cause inflammation.<br />The Coconut Oil is Healthy in Many Aspects just keep it in balance with foods with a positive rating. This information came from a book I just bought from Amazon, The Inflammation-Free Diet Plan by Monica Reinagel.  http://www.amazon.com/Inflammation-Free-Diet-Plan-Monica-Reinagel/dp/0071486011/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1260257694&sr=1-5  ,  I also bought the one by Jessica Black, the Anti-Inflammation Diet & Recipe Book. They're both good & both have recipes, however I like Monica Reinagel's book best for the large quantity foods that are rated on the Plus & Minus scale. They are done alphabetically and by type of food as well. Jessica Black doesn't give rhe individual ratings but she does give recipes with a good balance. I wanted to know the individual ratings as well."
1,"I LOVE this popcorn!  I am on a gluten free diet and this is a sweet snack that I can have.  It takes care of that chocolate fix and the only problem I have with it is that a bag only lasts through 2 settings, because it is soooooooo addicting."
1,"The black and white popcorn is great!  Full of yummy flavors and a satisifing snack.  The chocolate and kettle corn pieces really compliment each other.<br />  The review before is complaining about the amount of sugar in this popcorn but the whole concept of this snack is that its ""the lesser of two evils"".  Its not going to be 100% healthy but if you're going to snack anyway, this is the better way to go.<br />Also, the is my #1 favorite Gluten Free snack :)"
1,this is an amazingly healthy snack that tastes great.  I've been blowing through bags on the reg.  def worth trying.
1,"Wow! Lesser Evil Black and White Kettle Corn might be the best thing to ever hit my taste buds. The white kernels are magnificent, and the cocoa kernels add wonderful depth and complexity to this delightful snack. The texture is perfectly crisp, yet not too heavily coated. They have figured this whole ""kettle corn"" thing out. Bravo, Lesser Evil, bravo!"
1,A great and guiltless way to get your sugar kick.  With a name like lesser evil you know what your getting.  No deceptive marketing.  These guys are calling it like they see it.  Great snack.  Enjoyed it very much.
1,"Ebony and Ivory, side by side in this bag, two great tastes that taste great together. Why can't we all get along as well??? Sweet caramel corn and deep, dark chocolate battling for the most attention from your taste buds, but it ends in a delicious tie.<br /><br />If you're expecting ""kettle corn"", it's not really like that, it's more like caramel corn but there are not big globs of sugar/caramel like I've had with other brands (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). Just enough chocolate, not too much.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the bags are too big for one serving. There's no way you can put it down once you've started, and you end up being a pig. I suggest pouring out a reasonable size serving into a bowl, and then lock up the bag -- make sure you give the key to someone else!"
1,My kids absolutely love this stuff... This has taken over pirates booty as their favorite. I pack it for a snack in their lunches and even serve it as a snack to guests. I want to try their krinkle sticks now!
1,It's great to be able to have a snack that you needn't feel guilty about.....and it's healthy to boot.
1,"The whole chocolate and healthy kettle corn was just too appealing for me to resist so I ordered this product.  The kettle corn part of this snack is much better tasting to me than other brands of kettle corn.  You can still taste the popcorn and you're not damaging your teeth trying to crunch through whatever sweetener the competition uses on their kettle corn. Nutritionally, this product is as healthy as a snack of this sort can be.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the chocolate part fell short for me.<br /><br />It's just cocoa powder on popcorn so the brown kernels are cocoa tasting and not chocolate tasting as I had hoped.  Also not very sweet.  If you are a person who likes very dark chocolate and not so much the sweetness, you will probably love this product.<br /><br />Re packaging and shipping, the product arrived in perfect condition which all  bags sealed and the same condition you'd find it in at the store."
1,Nothing beats homemade Christmas Pudding but it is very labor intensive and time consuming to make during the holiday season.  The only time needed here is for steaming the pudding for one hour to get it to the right consistency and purchasing (or making) the traditional Brandy Butter sauce on the side.  This was indeed a Luxury Pudding and a very traditional English desert.  I'd purchase it again but don't wait til the last minute - these start selling out as you get closer to Christmas!
1,"This makes a tasty quick meal, it is a bit sweet for my taste, so I added a touch of chili oil. Not earth-shattering, but really not bad at all for a quickie microwaved meal or snack."
1,"Very tasty and about $2/box cheaper on amazon when I bought a 6 pack than individually at my local store. Peanut noodle is much more like the ""pad thai"" I grew up with than the pad thai flavor which was somewhat icky. The peanut noodle flavor comes with powdered coconut milk as part of the seasoning mix. Quite good for quick lunch (warning: higher calorie). Planning to take some camping, but will empty the take out style box into a ziplock to save space."
1,Title says it all. Solid product for a quick meal that taste fairly close to the real thing. Add shrimp or chicken for an awesome meal.
1,"I can't speak for its authenticity as a piece of Thai cuisine, but as a food that takes a few minutes of microwave preparation it is delicious. Rice noodles, ground peanuts, peanut sauce, and powdered coconut milk for the sauce come together to create something pretty tasty! It's sweet and a little spicy and the peanuts add a nice little crunch to it.<br /><br />It's not soupy, either- the sauce is fairly thick once the noodles absorb water, though it's not pasty or anything.<br /><br />If it were healthier it'd get 5 stars. As it stands, though, it's pretty good! I would recommend it, especially if you want something quick and very filling."
1,Sent this to my parents last Christmas (entering their 80s) and they absolutely loved the taste and portions.  Dove into a portion and froze the rest in the handy clear packs. My Mom spent a lot of time in Virginia as a child and said this brought back memories of her Grandpa's own smoked hams.  He sent a LOT of stuff like this up north during the tough times around WW II.  This company KNOWS quality.  A BEST BUY!!!
1,"I was very apprehensive about growing this wheat grass as it seemed quite complicated.  My intention was to grow the grass for my cats and dog.  I must say, I followed the directions implicitly and within one week the grass was tall enough to present to my animals!!  Today was the day and the cats seem to be eating it.  My dog doesn't seem interest----yet.  The kit includes everything you need with five growing pans.  I'm very happy with this product."
1,"This is great.  My two, older adopted cats, are strictly indoors.  I start a quarter cup of seeds every 3 months or so, and they love the fresh greens.  If I get behind on schedule, they try to eat houseplants, which is dangerous.  It starts easier than the package suggests.  You do not have to go the dark, covered route.  Just keep it misted.  When the seeds sprout, they take off on their own.  I put a rubber band over the pot, so the grass can grow great and the cats can't get too excited and steal the entire plant. If you don't secure the planting, the cats will take it out of the container."
0,"This is probably the worst tortellini I have ever bought and eaten. The filling of this pasta does not fully cook unless you completely overcook the pasta shell. This seems to apply to all of the flavors of tortellini that I tried by La Piana pasta. So you can either have over cooked pasta with under cooked filling that crumbles in your mouth or completely soggy pasta with an enjoyable filling. Both options are dissatisfying in their own way. Then there is the taste. The sundried tomato filling tastes off. It reminds me of a all natural ant spray my dad used to use when I was a kid. Not something that you want to eat. So do your self a favor and buy Barilla Pasta instead, cheaper and tastes better."
0,"Very dry, difficult to find that happy-place with this product.<br />I grew up in a Greek restaurant, I know food.........this product have us problems. Maybe missing quality-control, storing issues? Not sure.<br />There's far better products available for the money."
0,"While this product is very good,  and my son loves it, Drugstore911 should be ashamed of themselves - their markup is extraordinary.  This prices out to over $3.50 per pack which is more than  double other sources.  Shame on you,  Drugstore911,  I will never buy anything from you again."
1,"Amazon sells four Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe dinners. They're all pretty good. Each uses packets of cheese sauce, not packets of powder, so the cheese is never clumpy and distributes itself evenly. My husband, teenage daughter and I cooked up all four and did our own taste test. Here's what we found:<br /><br />The Original Cheddar flavor (Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe Dinner, 14-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)) is good. Plenty creamy, it tastes like a homemade version of the Kraft standard (i.e., <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HVRK"">Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Scooby Doo Shapes, 5.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)</a>).<br /><br />The Sharp Cheddar flavor (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1DSMC"">Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe Dinner, Sharp Cheddar, 14-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>) is slightly tastier, and has a subtle smoky aftertaste.<br /><br />The light meal (Kraft Deluxe Macaroni & Cheese Dinner - Light, 14 oz) is pretty good, ut when you try it side by side with the original flavor you can tell it's not as rich. Still, if you only buy this one you'll be happy. If you're counting calories go for it.<br /><br />But it's this one, the Four Cheese meal, that's the best. With the most cheese flavor, it combines American, cheddar, colby and parmesan, and tastes similar to what you'd find at a decent restaurant. The parmesan flavor is especially noticeable.<br /><br />These Deluxe dinners cost about twice as much as the basic Kraft boxes, but in each case you can really taste the difference."
1,"If you like macaroni and cheese, this is the best. Only better product would be to make it from scratch yourself. The four cheeses blend well. It will<br />compliment any meal as a sidedish."
1,I ordered this Kraft Mac and cheese Deluxe  dinner Four Cheese sauce 14 Ounce boxes pack of 12 I was scaptic on buying these products so I baught it and I really loved it the price is really good and I do work in a grocery store and I did add it up you buy the same amount of boxes it would be the same but it would be a little higher at the grocery when you add the tax so I think I did a great job in on buying for the right price i would buy this product again is they can keep the price of 27. and some change so buy this and I tell you that you will be hooked if you love mac and cheese as I am
0,"Chose this one because of the creamy cheese vs the powdered cheese even though it was more expensive. I put it on Subscribe and Save because I was certain the family would be wanting it all the time and it would save me time and effort making it from scratch all the time. Received it yesterday afternoon and made it last night for the family as a surprise side dish. It was awful. I don't know if I got a bad batch but the smell of the creamy cheese when I began mixing it with the hot pasta was so foul and nasty I had to open the kitchen windows to clear the stench out of the house. Mind you we're in MA with over 6' of snow right now piled everywhere and filling every nook and cranny available and minus temps and wind chills so believe me, I wouldn't have opened the windows and propped the back door open to get rid of the smell if it wasn't absolutely necessary.<br /><br />I remember having this as a kid, both powdered and creamy cheese but I sure don't recall it having a smell like this. It ruined all our appetites. Because the smell lingered throughout the house, we ended up leaving the house for a while and going out to eat after riding in the open air to clear our nostils. Terrible experience. I was thinking of keeping the remainder of the first order and making it when no one else is home to give to the 5 dogs, but on second thought, if it is a bad batch, I certainly don't want to feed it to my 4-legged babies. Out in the trash it goes and the S&S order canceled.<br /><br />Must admit I'm disappointed. I was hoping to be able to cheat now and then with mac and cheese I didn't have to make from scratch but if this is the alternative, I'll stick to my homemade recipe each and every time."
0,Why are the ingredients not listed?!?!?!  this has aspartame!  geee....now I see why the ingredients not listed for everyone to see.  jerks.....
1,"i'd been making iced sugar-free vanilla lattes at home with my espresso machine and some torani SF vanilla syrup, and noticed a certain ""funk"" in every one of my drinks... frustrated with how much better coffee bean's lattes tasted, i caved in and bought some of their no sugar added vanilla powder at their location nearest to me, and now i'm hooked.  the funk is gone.  and for the record, to those of you for whom this makes a difference, the powder isn't sugar-free.  i'm okay with this -- despite having type 1 diabetes, i'm willing to make the concession for 10g carbs for it to taste leaps and bounds better.<br /><br />my only complaint is that the can is deceptively large -- once you open it, it's only about half full.  i'll be sure to buy a 3-pack soon, as the in-store retail is $11.95.  another helpful tidbit -- add the powder only to the hot liquid, if you're making an iced drink.  first time around i ended up with unsightly clumps..."
0,"I checked several sites trying to find the ingredient list for this product before I purchased it, but couldn't find it.  Unfortunately this product contains many artificial ingredients and aspartame!  We made drinks with this once (my husband made them) before we read the ingredients.  The taste was pretty good, but left that aspartame aftertaste in our mouths.  If you don't care about your health or putting chemicals in your body, then this would be a good product for you.  Wish I could find a more wholesome substitution."
1,"A significant portion of my mornings are spent drinking English Breakfast Lattes from Coffee Bean.  I used to pay the light bill at store #003 in Beverly Hills.  When I stopped going there, I'm sure their top-line revenue took a huge hit.<br /><br />I've managed to replicate those latte's at home using product entirely sourced from Amazon!  Buy the CB&TL vanilla powder (the item I'm reviewing) and the following:<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YYODQY"">Bodum New Kenya 34-Ounce Tea Press, Black</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5F4"">Twinings English Breakfast Tea, Loose Tea, 3.53-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />If you're as addicted you'll thank me that you did.  Or curse me, depends on how you view your addiction.<br /><br />Cheers!"
1,"My husband is an avid espresso drinker. He will make up to 3-4 mochas a day, drinking them before and after work. I'm not a fan of coffee but love tea and drink a comparable amount of tea to his coffee. His favorite coffee house is Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, but they aren't as convenient as Starbucks and he now has a professional set up at home to make his own.<br /><br />Before this product, my husband used flavored syrup like they use at Starbucks and really liked the syrup. I bought this for myself to recreate a sugar-free, chai-tea latte. Husband was skeptical because it was sugar-free, but tried it and loved it. This powder has replaced the syrup and a lot of calories because it's sugar-free. My latte's are also out of this world (I use a chai-blend from Teavana.)<br /><br />Please be advised, my husband found the best results with his mocha by adding both the vanilla and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003QNLVCY"">The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf Chocolate Powder, 16-ounce Containers (Pack of 3)</a>mixed into hot milk. He then combines with the espresso and enjoys hot or over ice.<br /><br />We have both on auto-delivery and frequently run out before our next shipment. Highly recommended (& SUPER great price, these sell for $11.95 per container @ CB&TL)!"
1,"This is the best mix in for a tea latte. My favorite is chai, mixed with some nonfat milk and this wonderful powder."
1,"I got hooked on the Coffee Bean's tea lattes while living in Hawaii.  When we moved, I really missed getting them.  Luckily, they sell all of their ingredients so you can make them at home.  I have been doing so for a year.  The price here makes it a win-win!"
1,I use this vanilla powder for every cup of coffee that I ever drink as it really makes my cup as if the cup was made at Coffee Bean. Granted I also use a frother though this vanilla powder honestly is a great tasting product that can make any coffee drinkers morning something to look forward to. One container can last you awhile based on your coffee consumption though with this Three pack it really saves you money than buying them in person from the Coffee Bean itself. The only downfall I have had from ordering them is that shipping can be really rough as one time I had a container smashed open with the other containers all banged and dinged up. The most recent shipment arrived better then the last though still with some of the containers dinged up still though none open.<br /><br />I recommend this great tasting product as it makes all my cups of coffee taste as good as if I bought it from a coffee shop. Great savings though be warned that the containers may not arrive in perfect condition.
1,"My obsession! This powder is delicious! I love making caramel ice blended drinks....guilt free. 2 cups ice, 1 cup lowfat milk, 2 tbs vanilla powder, 2 tbs caramel syrup. Chop, blend, and pur&eacute;e in blender until ice is super fine.<br /> Drizzle caramel on top with dollop of whip cream! You'll think you are drinking a ice cream shake! YUM"
1,"I bought this to use with my CBTL coffee machine, and I was absolutely thrilled with the taste. Other reviewers mentioned a metallic taste, and that worried me a little - I'm glad I bought anyway, because this stuff is delicious. I did not notice any strange taste at all, and I've been loving making my own sugar-free vanilla drinks. Highly recommend!"
1,"On the East coast CBTL doesn't exist yet, well except in my dreams. This mix is perfect for a variety of uses...mix w hot water, tea, coffee, espresso, blend w ice and add a packet of via (Starbucks instant coffee) or any instant coffee...even Nescaf&eacute; is delish. W a nespsso maker, an aeroccino, and a can of this magic every sip is stellar. Plan on trying the cocoa next to replace the Swiss miss sugar free which also compliments this mix.<br />My only disappointment is the huge box and badly dented cans I received...is this the reason the cost is much lower? Sort of negates giving them as gifts."
1,"Know when you order this you are getting 3 cannisters of powder. But as I said for the chocolate package, you can never have enough. You will find yourself using these powders for so many dishes. I also mix a little into my milks to make a flavored froth, when using my CBTL for specialty coffees. The taste is very good; you would never know you are tasting a sugar-free powder."
1,This stuff is great!  I had tried the sugar free cocoa before and liked it so I thought I would try this as well.  It can be used in so many ways and is delicious in everything I've tried.  It is a good substitute for milk in tea latte's and adds just the right amount of sweetness.
1,Let me say that this is my favorite stuff in the universe. It's so good added to my tea. With my sweet tooth it's just the fix that I need to keep me out of the pantry and out of the family snacks during the day.
1,"I have made and perfected to my liking my red curry using this paste.  1 can of coconut milk and 1 heaping and not overly loaded tablespoon of red curry will give a very good kick without being to spicy to taste your food.<br />Using a wok I put 1 can of coconut milk with 1 tablespoon of red curry and bring to boil stering till it thickens a bit.  I do not recommend fish sauce since it makes curry taste fishy and not slightly peanuty. I do like seafood and buy smoked salmon often.  But this fish sauce doesn't belong in this dish-trust me.  Less is better with this curry.  So, thicken your sauce add little palm sugar and sea or kosher salt to taste. Taste it to make sure you like it.  It should be spicy, sweet and slightly peanuty.<br />Now add shopped carrots, sliced (thick) bell peppers, asparagus or french green beans,sugar snow peas, onion cut thick, garlic cut in halfs and chopped mushrooms(small). Last time I added to my vegetables half cut of small cuts of fresh pineapple and it was wonderful. Give a good stir and cook till vegetables half cooked then add shrimp and cook it all till shrimp is done to your liking.  If you put shrimps with vegetables shrimp will get overcooked and will be small and rubbery.  I put raw 31-40 raw from Costco shrimp and it is perfect.  Chicken thighs from Costco are very juicy as well but you would want to slice them 1/4"" and cook with your vegetables at the same time.  Thicken sauce just a little at the end and serve over Jasmine rice.  Hope you'll like my version of red curry."
1,"I make my own Indian curry from scracth in a mortar and pestel.  I buy Chinese, Korean and Thai curry.  Thai Kitchen used to have a good red and green Thai curry but something has changed for the worse.  Now there is almost no heat or flavor -- it's just salty and not even hot.<br /><br />A Taste of Thai Red Curry packs a punch and is very flavorful.  A far superior product to Thai Kitchen's competitive products.  Thai cooking is super easy with a few ingredients:<br />  1) Peanut (or vegetable oil)<br />  2) Red Curry to taste<br />  3) Coconut Milk (I use Lite)<br />  4) Protein(tofu, meat, seafood, etc.)<br />  5) Vegetables (carrots, string beans, etc.)<br />  6) Basil and/or cilantro<br />  7) Vietnamese fish sauce (you need this!)<br /><br />Stir-fry oil, curry, protein(s) and vegetables until just cooked.  Add coconut milk and fish sauce heating quickly.  Serve immediately and garnish with basil/cilantro.  You'll think that you're at you favorite Thai restarant."
1,"We purchased Taste of Thai Red/Green/yellow curry pastes as well as the Pad Thai sauce. They are beyond excellent. Worth every cent, and the bucket sizes are incredibly economical."
1,"This curry paste has a geat taste, we use it in soups, stir fries, vegetable dishes and anything you would like to add some extra zing to."
1,Looking for something special on your english muffin Sunday morning?  This is it.  The tangy flavor of cranberries sweatened and mellowed with Cointreau... hmmmm!  Use something good but ordinary during the week like Smuckers strawberry and you'll really appreciate the difference.
1,"The popcorn itself is yummy, just be warned that we had trouble popping it using our air popper.  The kernels were too light and would blow out of the popper before they were popped.  It's great in the microwave or a pan, but maybe the larger white or yellow would be a better match for an air popper."
1,"I won't claim to be a professional food taster ... I just know what I like and don't like.  I don't like ""yellow"" popcorn, I don't like microwave popcorn, I like the ""white"" popcorn cooked in a pan.  For my ""popping style"" the Baby White pops great w/o lots of hard kernels.  'nuf said."
1,"This is really good. Tender, a little sweet. Easy to make in the Whirley Pop, and excellent with some Cheddar & Spice popcorn seasoning!"
1,"I was a little concerned to buy the popcorn, as you never know what you are going to get.  But I did and I am glad I did.  The popcorn is nice and tender, pops easy, great taste and hull-less.  I have moved from the microwave popcorns and glad I did because of this product.  I like the fact the the popped corn is small but great!"
0,"I love the popcorn, but the shipping costs are INSANE!! A total rip off. Wabash Valley Farms or Amazon or whoever is charging the shipping is out of their mind. 5 Stars for the popcorn. Minus 4 stars for the terrible cost associated with shipping. Argh...Yes, the popcorn is tender and luscious, and it melts in your mouth like you're eating cooked grasshoppers, but come on!!! Can't you ship this product for less?<br /><br />Shipping the 6 pound bag is even worse. *sigh* Too bad really."
1,"We like the much harder to find ""white"" popcorn over the more common ""yellow"" popcorn and Amish Country Baby White is our absolute favorite.  We usually order 3 of the 6 lb bags 'cause we go thru it so quickly."
1,I love this popcorn. Only downside is the shipping and packing. Cost almost as much as the popcorn. Need to pack it better. Bag split and a bunch of loose popcorn falling out of the box when the guy brought it to my door.
0,"I purchased the baby white by accident.  We usually get the medium white, which is great.  The baby is so small when popped that the taste and texture of the hull shell really overwhelm it."
0,"Tasty, small kernel popcorn. However, too small and too light to be popped in a hot air popcorn popper. The kernels are blown out of the popper before they are popped."
1,This is the best popcorn i have ever ate. I use a Whirley Popper to pop my popcorn. When you eat this baby white hulless you will never go back to any other popcorn. I gave my Orville Redenbacher's  and Walmart popcorn away..To many husks. You just can't beat this popcorn. It tastes sooooo good even my puppy loves it.
1,"I first had this popcorn at my 84 year old cousin's home. I thought it was so tender and delicious, and I wanted to buy some for myself. I found it on Amazon.com believe it or not!!!  Anyway, I ordered 6 pounds of it. All 6 pounds are now gone. This popcorn is REALLY good. It is different than other popcorns I have eaten because the kernels are small and very delicate. I consider myself a pro when it comes to popcorn because I have eaten it every night since I was a little girl. I usually eat my popcorn 1 kernel at a time, but since the kernels are so small, I ate it by the handful. My only complaint is that it does cost a lot to have it shipped. I wish I could find it locally so I would not have to pay for the shipping costs. If you like popcorn, I highly recommend it."
1,OVER THE YEARS I HAVE BOUGHT A LOT OF POPCORN FOR POPPING AND I HAVE FOUND THIS SMALL BABY WHITE HULLESS TO BE THE BEST FOR POPPING AND NOT A LOT OF THE SO-CALLED OLD-MAIDS I ALSO HAD TO RETIRE MY 20 PLUS YEAR OLD WABASH VALLEY FARMS STOVETOP POPPER IT WAS A GOOD ONE SO IF YOU LIKE POPCORN AND WHO DOESN'T THIS POPCORN AND POPPER COMBINATION IS THE BEST AND THE POPPER COMES WITH A 25 YEAR WARRANTY AS WELL MONEY WELL SPENT YOU WILL NOT DISSAPOINTED WITH EITHER OF THEM SO ENJOY
1,This is the best popcorn I have ever had.  As a kid I ran the popcorn machine in a theater so I feel I know what I'm talking about.  We used yellow popcorn but I still think white is best.
1,"Baby white popcorn from Wabash Farms pops nicely, has no meanacing hulls to get into your teeth, and is very tasty. What more could you ask from a popcorn? I highly recommend this product. At least a four star."
1,"The small, white popcorn is the best!  Very delicious - and I've tried lots."
1,"This was the sweetest, smallest, hulless, best tasting white popcorn I have ever had.  Just placed an additional order for a 6 lb. bag as well as other varities carried by this company."
1,Great popcorn!! Good popping results and wonderful flavor.  Can't help but love it and I will re-order when I run out.  Recommend to one and all
1,"I love little white kernels of popped corn.  This was good stuff, but I think I'll try a larger white kernel to pop next time, my preference."
1,Pops great in the microwave.  Much better than many store brands.  Good product.
1,"My doctor told me I must eat ""hulless"" popcorn if I have popcorn at all.  Because I can't give up my favorite snack, I bought this Wabash Famnily Farms Amish Country popcorn.  The kernels are tiny, but they pop well, although not as big and fluffy as the popcorn I get from the grocery store.  It tastes great, however, and has fewer and smaller hulls.  I don't think there is such a thing as completely hulless,but Ido notice thst I don't get the hulls stuck in my teeth anymore."
1,I ordered 3 6lb bags with free shipping because of the reviews. I really like it but the real test was my wife's opinion and we also ordered 4 and 1/2 lbs of popcorn from the Boulder popcorn co and the kernels were a little smaller and tasted better. We use coconut oil and it has very good flavor even without butter. I really like the Cambria's Cream kernels the best
1,"I just made some in my Whirley Pop.  It really is lighter and crisper than the larger, yellow kernels.  None of those large hulls either.  The only difference is, it pops up much smaller than the yellow, so you need to almost double the amount of kernels used per pot.  Lovely homemade popcorn."
1,"Use olive oil to cook this, salt it well, and it is the best, most tender popcorn I have ever eaten. I add a tiny bit of butter to mine, but don't need it. My nine year old daughter didn't like popcorn until she reluctantly tried this. After a few bites, she consumed half the bowl!<br /><br />I bought mine at a specialty popcorn shop in Long Grove IL, so I didn't have to pay shipping costs, but when it's gone, I might have to bite the bullet and order it from here."
1,"We've enjoyed this popcorn every bit as much if not more than the Movie Theater Popcorn.  It's light and fluffy - tender - and delicious.  I think we enjoy it a bit more because we know there is no ""palm"" oil or coconut oil in it - we can control what oils we add or leave out.  It works well with the popper - in fact just last night we had a popper full of this corn and followed it with the other because we had purchased so much of the other - we enjoyed this more."
0,"Popcorn has grear color (white)  But taste is average and due to shipping costing more then product, I would not buy again."
1,"I bought the Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper several months ago, which (of course) the Wabash Valley popcorn came recommended (same company). I thought...what the heck; I've always wondered how ""gourmet"" popcorn differed from Orville or other everyday popcorn brands.<br /><br />Let me tell you...IT IS WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY! I can really taste the difference in quality. AND, ""normal"" popcorn just doesn't taste right when you make it in the Whirley-Pop.<br /><br />This popcorn is so tender and tasty. It was a little weird to see and eat at first because it's about half the size of regular popcorn. But, I believe this characteristic is essential in helping the seasonings completely coat the corn.<br /><br />My favorite prep methods include using the Whirley-Pop and Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil (see my review for that for more details!) I add a little peanut oil, sea salt, black pepper, and a good amount of Vegaline Garlic Mist Cooking & Seasoning Spray. YUMMY!!!!<br /><br />I've tried the other Amish Country popcorn, and they're all good. This is my favorite, though!"
1,This popcorn is really great!  We enjoy the taste and the smallness of the actual popcorn.  Its not like the popcorn that is big and fluffy its small and really great to eat.  I eat only this popcorn now and order every three months. Highly recommend to the popcorn lovers of the world.
1,"I bought a bowl to pop the corn in along with this popcorn. And put two handsful in the bowl and set the microwave on Popcorn. But it needed more popping for all to pop, in fact almost twice as much time. But the results are great.<br />Today we will get the seasoning I bought for it and look forward to using it to have a woderful snack while watching TV."
0,"This is  terrible popcorn! No taste, poor popping ratio. and the size OMG! I popped this Gourmet popping corn in front of a party, everyone busted out in laughter!"
0,"Do not spend your money on this product as you will find the popping ratio extremely poor. One cup of popcorn will have 1/2 cup of  un poped (old Mades) kernels left over which is unacceptable.This is a non returnable item so if you buy this one you are just out of luck, so I recommend staying away from this one."
1,popcorn is very good.  cant believe the difference between this popcorn and the regular stuff at the story. a very good purchase.
0,"Bought 6lbs of this popcorn based on reviews that the hulls are softer on this Baby White than on regular popcorn.  Not only are the hulls just as tough as regular popcorn, the corn pops up so tiny that it's about 1/3 hull, 2/3 popped corn per kernel! I was hoping to use this as a healthy snack for my kids who love popcorn but not the hulls.<br />I popped this using every tip I could find on the internet; all experiments still resulted in a tough hull."
1,"I liked the idea of the small popcorn.  It pops up really well in the popper but it doesn't have much if any ""popcorn"" flavor.  Was pretty bummed by that."
1,"I used to grow the Japanese hulless in small quantities for my stovetop popper. This is the closest I can find. If you are appalled by the shipping cost, like I was, try looking elsewhere for a better deal. For instance, one popular site offers 6 lbs for $11.95 with FREE shipping if you sign up for repeating shipments (which you can cancel any time). Try www.c**king.com."
1,I have made this my popcorn of choice.  I enjoy the flavor and kernal size.
1,"Get it, Get it, Get it! This popcorn is truly the most tender, delicious popcorn I have ever tasted."
1,"Got three different Amish popcorn's for my daughter's Birthday..she is always on a diet, I got her the hot air popper same time...she & my grandson..( he's 4) loved it..she ate a bowl every night &  still lost 15 lbs !! not saying it's a diet food, just satisfiing !!"
1,I bought this popcorn as a gift for some dear friends. The have commented back several times that it's the best popcorn they have ever had. They love it!  They had shopped in the DC metro area to find white popcorn and could never find it so one look on Amazon was all it took to find this -- the best popcorn ever!!
1,"I bought this for my daughter's new microwave popcorn popper as a Christmas gift, and she says that it is delicious, but pops up smaller than other popcorn.  She likes it a lot."
1,"This is very high qulity pop corn, I recomend it.  Almost all kernels pop and they are a crisp white when they pop.  Very healthy and yummy!"
1,"Pops fully, few spare kernels with the traditional stovetop method.  Small, fluffy kernels, not a lot of 'misfires' that are only partially evolved.  My wife says they're a tad too small for her taste, but the kids and I really love this popcorn."
1,This popcorn brings me back to days before the microwave version. What a treat it was to savor the taste and lightly salted lily white popcorn that was popped over the heat of a stove burner again.
1,"I love this brand,  all kernels pop and they are a nice size, texture and flavor."
1,"I have not eaten this popcorn or tasted it myself, it was part of a gift for my daughter in Grad School.  She likes the fluffy quality of the popped corn and the not so many hulls - also the big bag makes her think she can make it last until Christmas ( that remains to be seen) without having to buy more.  A very good snack for a poor Grad Student"
1,"I'm a huge popcorn fan and have tried all sorts, and the Amish Country brand popcorn is the best I've ever eaten.  Absolutely delicious!"
1,"There are very seldom any unpopped kernels, which is nice and the flavor is wonderful. Not a whole lot to say about popcorn. I always buy from you guys and will continue to."
1,"I love white corn, in all its forms, including popcorn. And I hate how outrageously expensive the kernels are in the supermarket, so I love this popcorn."
1,"I enjoy it practically every evening, it is very good popcorn, not as much hulls and small when popped."
1,"This popcorn is much smaller than your average popcorn, and it is virtually hulless.  That is exactly what I was looking for in a popcorn because my 3 year old LOVES popcorn.  With 3 year old children, you have to be concerned with the hulls causing choking or hurting their tender gums.  My son has no trouble eating this popcorn.  It is soft and light, doesn't get stuck in your teeth nearly as much, and has a great flavor.<br /><br />This is now my popcorn of choice for our whole family.  I usually pop it in my 10 year old cheap hot air popper with no problems.  I get very few unpopped kernels. Another reviewer stated that it flies out before popping, but I have not experienced this problem (it could depend on the popper, I suppose).  I have tried microwaving it in a paper bag, but I always seem to end up burning it.  I think it takes a little more trial and error for microwaving to get the time just right, so I just stick with my hot air popper. I get great popcorn every time!"
0,I am so surprised that they have this popcorn for sale.  I received 6 bags the other day and the special popcorn pan from Wabash Valley Farms Amish Country ....GOURMET ... well.. the popped kernels are the size of a pea and with hulls.  It burns very easily.  There are too many old maids due to the delicate nature of the kernel.  I ended up throwing most of the popped corn away.  I am so disappointed in this product.  I now have 5.75 bags of this stuff ... I have nothing good to say about it ... but if you like tiny popped corn with lots of hulls then this may be your product.  I am giving mine to the squirrels.
1,"I bought this with the whirly pop popcorn popper, and I made some as soon as I got them. It is the best popcorn I've had. I thought I would mind the smaller kernel size, but I didn't. There is substantially less hull than regular popcorn. The flavor is great. I suggest using peanut oil for popping popcorn. It gives popcorn a great nutty taste - really delicious. You can buy peanut oil at any oriental (Asian) store. It's better than olive oil (olive oil and popcorn is too weird for me). But peanut oil is perfect. You won't need butter flavor or anything like that again (artificial butter flavorings are full of chemicals). Now, we pop around three times a day and always crave this for a snack instead of junkfood. Try it and you'll be popping like us."
0,"the baby white popcorn has lots of hulls when popped, very small kernels and scorched the bottom of my new whirley popper. I've had several poppers and this is the first time one has scorched and the first time I've used the Wabash corn. shipping charges were very high for a relatively inexpensive corn."
0,This popcorn has alot of hulls I order 4 bags and can't stand to eat it it's so hully - terrible
0,"I ordered this because Amazon recommended it to go along with the Redenbacker popcorn popper I got from them. Hey, only a few of these actually pop! Most of these small, unpopped kernels get thrown out of the popper. What an absolute waste of money!"
0,worst popcorn ive ever bought.  chewy not fluffy.  gave it to the birds for bird food.  postage was outrageous!  just not a good experience all around.  wont be buying from them ever again.
1,"This is delicious popcorn -- lost a star because I use a hot air popper and many of them  ""jump"" out before popping.  Great flavor, great texture - tender.  I do not add anything even though I have purchased three different flavored toppings.<br /><br />Thanks,"
0,"This ""Baby White"" popcorn pops small and somewhat hard.  I have tried several batches with various adjustments of heat, using a ""whirlypop"" popcorn popper.  Unsatisfactory results!  I won't purchase this again."
0,wE LOVED THIS POPCORN  BUT COME ON  SHIPPING IS WAY OVER THE TOP  WE WOULD SETTLE NEXT TIME FOR SOMETHING WE CAN BUY BUT NOT SPEND 3 TIMES ON SHIPPING
0,"I can only go as low as 1 star on the review, though I'd like to rate it a ""0""- this item still shows in stock, but clearly isn't, which is why my order was canceled from Amazon today. Amazon suggested I search out the item again, and in doing so I see that this same vendor states the item is available. Not so.<br /><br />Technically this review does not relate to the quality of the product, just the ability to be able to ship it. Good luck!"
1,"I'm a Bigelow & Twinnings tea fan, the green tea assortment is great specially the mango and peach flavors are really intense and delicious plus you have the added bonus of getting Decaff on each box.Last but not least you get a better deal at Amazon that the online tea store."
1,"Not sure if you should bother reading about what other people think of the flavor, since we all have different tastes.  But for me, this is the first and only box of Green Tea I've ever enjoyed (out of many brands).  The fruit flavors are delicious (at least to my taste buds).  I especially like the peach."
0,"I was so disappointed with this tea. i bought a box during lunchtime looking forward to a nice cup of tea in the afternoon. I made the cup and took a sip - YUCK. It tasted fishy to me but couldn't figure out why tea would taste fishy so I read the ingredients. I wish I had read them before - the second listed ingredient is an oil blend of tuna oil, soy oil, and soy lecithin. Just the thought of tuna oil in my tea is enough to make me gag - the actual taste is just as bad."
0,"I like a large variety of herbal teas but not this one. Here, the flavor of  Omega 3 strongly overwhelms the tastes of pomegranate and blubbery. Probably, this tea is good for you but it has a distinct ""fishy"" taste."
0,"I am always looking for ways to get in Omega-3's and find a lot of pills to incur those ""fishy"" burps hours after taking them plus the routine of remembering to take the pills daily.  I love tea both hot and iced so I was quite excited to try this one...tea + Omega 3's...perfect.  I smelled the fishy smell before I even tasted the tea.  I did force myself to tast it and took about two sips then had to pour out the whole pitcher I had brewed.  It is quite fishy tasting.  Ridiculously so.  Glad I bought the box on sale so I don't feel bad about tossing it but it is so bad I can't even fathom making someone else go through the smell and tasting I just did."
1,"I do not taste a fishy taste at all. It is awesome hot or cold. Maybe the other drinkers are not using right amount of H2O. It has reduced blood pressure in patients of mine, and actually recommended."
0,"I picked this up at my local store and after brewing poured it out right away. The first thing you taste is bad fish, then a berry taste. It was so gross. I read the label and tuna oil is how they get the Omega 3. I should have picked up a pomegranate flavor with out the omega 3. I wrote an email to Bigelow since my satisfaction was not met. I will see if I get a response. Disgusting, I had to brew something else to get the taste out. Learned my lesson- fish oil does not go in tea!"
0,"I have been a bigelow loyal for years, especially the super fruit kind of teas, and then saw this product. Pomegranate with omega3 sounded very good. But the first sip brought all to an end. I was having FISH tea!!! Fishy taste and smell! And then I read the contents- of course the Omega 3 was from tuna oil! Disgusting! I have burned once and now I will read Bigelow labels very carefully."
1,"Let me throw some confusion into the mix. I have a different take than the other two reviewers. I am not a tea drinker but I thought I'd give this a try when my husband brought it home. Honestly, I never even noticed the Omega 3 on the package and I especially didn't taste anything fishy in the tea (I don't like fish either).  Anyway, I loved this tea. I even made it into a cold drink for guests and they liked it too."
1,Not a strong fruity flavor. You can tell there's fruit in it but not really what kind. Better than some low carb muffin mixes.
1,"With 190 calories for a six cracker packet with pepper jack is a great snacking cracker sandwich with just a little bit of a kick.  I will definately be staying on subcribe & save for these Austin Pepper Jack cracker packets.  Luv em! I do wish I could find someting like this in a whole grain cracker, but until then these are great."
1,Love these Austin Pepper Jack Crackers. They have great freshness and a great taste plus the price you just cant hardly beat. Thank You Amazon!
1,If you like spicy...then these are the snack crackers for you. So hard to find ANYWHERE ELSE...a really good price on here!
1,This product arrived in about three days.  Never use the entire packet for one recipe unless you like hot seasonings!  It is extremely hot.
0,"Don't waste your money and order directly from Nespresso!  Any Nespresso capsules sold on amazon (by various vendors) are marked WAY up, some by as much as 50%!  Don't be fooled."
1,"The variety, not the brand, was recommended by a friend. Five stars is given with the caveat that other brands were not tried for comparison. The Choice Organic Russian Caravan blend seems to be the only such blend easily available in tea bags.  The unit cost of the product is an excellent value here on amazon, compared to other sellers' offers.<br /><br />The tea is a bit more delicate than one might expect, based on description. Steeping five minutes is recommended, for a full-flavored experience.  The flavor is delightful -- a good black tea, but with a distinctive smoky quality."
1,"Choice Organic Russian Caravan is my morning tea of choice since a few years back. This is a very high quality tea, no doubt about it. Never had a bad batch, box or single tea bag. I've tried many other teas from Choice Organic and the high quality shines through throughout the product line."
1,"Choice ""Russian Caravan"" tea is excellent! It's got an unusually smoky flavor, and it is stronger than most black teas. Black teas are for the most part caffeinated, but they don't usually have a distinctive roasted flavor. Tea is an essential part of Russian fare;traditional Russian hospitality meant bringing out the samovar with sugar cubes (along with bread and salt) This tea would taste great while looking out onto the Pacific Ocean from Fort Ross, the southernmost Russian outpost in Sonoma County, California, settled in 1812. It's good for a rainy day, while curled up reading <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400079985"">War and Peace (Vintage Classics)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199536066"">Anna Karenina (Oxford World's Classics)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1434677702"">Plays by Anton Chekhov- Second Series</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OEJE6Y"">Complete Works of Fyodor Dostoyevsky (Illustrated)</a>, or even <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0057DC3GO"">Russia Against Napoleon: The True Story of the Campaigns of War and Peace</a>.

1,"This tea is tasty, refreshing, and mysterious. It has a smokey aroma and robust ""outdoor"" flavor.  In the past I purchased it from a local health food store by I recently relocated and couldn't find it in even the large chain health food store! I introduce this tea to all my tea drinking friends who aren't afraid to try something new. It is worth every penny."
1,"If there was a Johnny Walker Black of teas, this one would be it. Nice and smoky, try it with a cigar."
1,"I bought several boxes of these cookies for Christmas gifts and had one box left over.  I decided to try them with my coffee one morning and got the surprise of my life.  THESE ARE THE BEST COOKIES, THIS SIDE OF HEAVEN!  I've never tasted anything quite as good.  They're simple little bite size cookies, but surprisingly they do take you back...back to a time when things were simpler, and happier. As cookies go, these are quite a healthy choice.  I tend to look for products using wheat flour.  They made me remember my grandmother's kitchen, as she baked special treats for the family.  All I can say is they are simply amazing, and you'll do yourself a great disservice if you don't try them.  It'll take care of that need for ""something sweet"", without all the calories. I promise, you won't be disappointed."
1,So far this is my fav. HOWEVER. if i were to buy direct from Nespresso the 50 capsules would only be $32.50
0,"Nespresso does NOT officially distribute their product through Amazon - what you are purchasing here is a re-sold product from third-party seller who has purchased it directly from Nespresso (exactly what YOU should be doing) and is now re-selling this product to get a nice profit from simple-minded customers. Buy it directly from Nespresso, people - you WILL get a cheaper price and you WILL get a more fresh coffee (you can't know how long this coffee was stored at third-party reseller's location)."
1,"After trying about 15 different varieties of the short Nespressos, Rosabaya De Columbia is the one I've settled on. It's potent without being bitter and is closest to the traditional espresso you would get in a French or Italian restaurant. For the long one, I prefer Fortissio Lungo."
0,"Nespresso makes GREAT coffee and GREAT machines. I switched over to a Nespresso machine 7 years ago and have never looked back. I save a small fortune every year by making my lattes at home.<br /><br />That being said, the Nespresso capsule offers posted here are from a third party who is putting a large additional margin on their price.<br /><br />You can order the same products online from Nespresso for approx $0.55 each (half the price here)."
1,This is one of the best ! No aftertaste or bitterness. Capriccio is normally my fave but this may have surpassed it! Delicious!!!
1,"My ""picky"" Morkie loves her new IAMS dog food.  She was eating IAMS before...but not the Healthy Natural one.  It's a tiny bit more expensive....but her delight with the new dog food is worth every penny!  She actually reacted to this dog food when I first offered it to her like she acts when she is given a dog treat!  I am very pleased with this purchase...and so is Katie!"
1,"I have bought these almonds for Christmas for the last two years. They were shipped shrink wrapped together with a cardboard base and never taped together.<br /><br />I always buy these specific almonds because they make a nice presentation, especially for the holidays. They are not your typical almond with the brown outer coating and salty texture. They are actually round, not oval, and I didn't find them to be too salty at all - they were just right. Also important to note that they are halved."

0,"I had this type of nut while visiting California.  When I returned to New York, I ordered the same brand of nuts on Amazon.  When they arrived they were stale and rancid.  I would never order from this company again."
1,"Just pure and wonderful, no added flavors interfering like orange peel, lemon, allspice etc. The packaging was great, no staples, no plastic wrappers and Fair Trade Certified to boot...  I used no sweetener, just let it steep and do its thing.  Find a good book and curl up, before you know it you'll be having sweet zzzzz's."
1,brews well even stands up to sweetner and a little milk if you like it that way
1,"This tea is absolutely delicious! It has become my new favorite tea, the flavor is fantastic. Very delicate and mild with a beautiful floral scent perfect paired with honey. I highly recommend this tea! I bought a pack of six and it went fast, everyone in my family loves it!"
1,"I first purchased this at grocery store. Much better price on Amazon. Some chamomiles taste really 'weedy' to me, seems strange to describe a chamomile as rich tasting, but does not need sweetener or anything else. And would only us an herbal tea that is organic--think about it! Definitely notice that it helps me relax in the evening to get to sleep more quickly. Choice is one of our favorite brands."
1,"It helps me to calm and feel relax after a long day from work.  Also it helped me to get through the stomach flu a few days ago. Well when you has gastroenteritis and drink this tea, you'll know what I'm talking."
1,"This is a great tea, clean and simple (and decaf).  The product is organic and fair trade.  The package is made from recycled content and the design of the tea bag and its individual package is perfect and so easy to use, no tearing of paper or tangling of tag/string.  I will buy more from Choice organic tea."
0,"When my local Asian grocer stopped carrying the small tin of Japanese matcha green tea powder I'd been purchasing, I searched for a comparable (price/quality) alternative.  Amazon, as always, was my first stop, but to no avail.  Instead, I found this identical green tea powder from The Republic of Tea at Whole Foods Market, for $17.99.  Wondering to myself, ""How did I miss this on Amazon?"" I came back here to look it up, planning to make all subsequent purchases here.  Imagine my shock to find it listed for twice the price (almost $40) as what is arguably the planet's highest end grocery chain.<br /><br />This is a great, high quality green tea powder, especially for smoothies.  That said, don't fall for this price gouging.  Please visit your local Whole Foods or other health food store first, where you'll find it at half the price.  If they don't stock it on the shelves, go to customer service and I'm sure they'll order it for you, at no extra cost.  Shame on You, [It's A Treasure]!!! (seller)  When they cease their price gouging and bring the price back in line to a reasonable retail price point, I'll change my rating to reflect the actual product, but as it stands there's no way I'm going to award 5 stars and assist this seller in continuing to gouge the public."
0,"I am a regular matcha drinker, and have been buying matcha from Mitsuwa or Sunrise Mart NYC for years, but bought this Republic of Tea matcha at the local Whole Foods. The colour of the tea is nothing like in the image on the package, it is a dull green (which means more oxidation and stems). There are usually three qualities of matcha: ceremonial, universal, and culinary. I am giving this tea 1 star because it is culinary quality at best. Don't waste your money.<br /><br />If you want good matcha, is best to try the universal quality Maeda-En (gold package). Or if you want to splurge, try the ceremonial (black package) quality, both for sale here on amazon or straight from the Maeda-en Website."
1,Reminds me of the green tea I enjoy at my favorite Japanese restaurant. I really like that I am able to use the powder as strong or as weak as I want. I am very please with my purchase.
1,"I wanted to note that these are the best-tasting, raw lemon cookies I have ever tried. I will not use banal frases such as ""they are good for you"" or anything like that. I will just mention that they leave me satisfied and with a joyful feeling inside. I can feel that these raw cookis are made with love, and I will definitely purchase them again."
1,"When I saw Weetabix in my local grocery a few months ago, I just had to try it!  How many breakfast foods do you know of, that get mentioned frequently in British novels and on BBC television programs?<br /><br />Not surprisingly, the whole grain ""biscuits"" are delicious.  They're nutritious, too:  two biscuits with skim milk (no sugar required) provide 170 calories (10 from fat), 130mg sodium, 150mg potassium, 29g carbohydrates (including 4g dietary fiber and 2g sugar), 4g protein, no cholesterol, and a few vitamins and minerals.  The biscuits themselves (12 to a package, or 6 servings) are light, crisp, and flaky.<br /><br />According to the package, ""Weetabix is great on its own or with milk"".  However the biscuits are very dry, so I can't imagine eating them plain.  When you add low-fat milk (1% or 2%), the biscuits soak the milk up quickly.  If you don't eat your Weetabix right away, the biscuits will break apart and your morning cereal will be a little soggy.<br /><br />But I like Weetabix, even when it's soggy, because of the delicate flavor and pleasant texture.  Weetabix has now replaced my previous favorite adult fiber cereal, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037N1ZEW"">Post Shredded Wheat Original Cereal, Spoon Size</a>, and has become an almost daily habit.  The pack of 12 boxes seems like a lot of Weetabix--72 servings--but it's actually about a 2-1/2 month supply for one person."
1,"I have eaten Weetabix cereal for over 30 years, since I first found it in England while shopping with family.  It is wholesome and nutritious, great with cold milk in the summer and warm milk in the wintertime. I highly recommend it if you like a cereal that is tasty and versatile."

1,This stuff was so good.  The only bad thing about that was that I couldn't stop eating it.  Next time I will have to have a better control.
1,"The first time I heard of peppermint tea it didn't sound very good to me.  But I'm so glad I tried it because it is delicious and very soothing on the stomach.  I like that it's organic, it smells heavenly and I enjoy a cup every evening.  I would highly recommend it, even to ""tea purists"".  Give it a try!"
1,"I've been drinking Choice Peppermint Tea for about 4 years and have found it to always be very consistent and flavourful. I started drinking it when I had a case of Colitis and that caused frequent upset stomachs. The tea helped then to a great extent, and now I drink it just because it's so nice.<br /><br />Evenings are best, with a bit of dark chocolate - purely medicinal you understand ;)"
1,I had a hard time trying to find a peppermint tea that was organic till I found this. Way better than non-organic.
1,This wonderful organic tea is a delight. Perfect peppermint taste and oh so yummy especially near bedtime (no caffeine!). Very tasteful as well as soothing. Enjoy!
1,"Lovely aroma, good for sore throat or calming stomach as well as pure enjoyment.  My favorite brand of peppermint tea!"
1,"I love this organic peppermint tea. It is the best that I have found anywhere. The aroma is really nice and the flavor is great! I combine it with green tea when I need a little energy, and drink it by itself after a meal."
1,This is my favorite peppermint tea!  Every cup has just the right amount of peppermint flavor.  Not too light and not too strong.
1,this is the best peppermint tea i have found and at 1/2 the price of whole foods.
1,"Herb Tea, Bengal Spice, 20 ct ( Value Bulk Multi-pack).It was fine.I really enjoyed the tea it was so good. I don't like being forced into 20 words for a review"
1,Everybody in the family really loved the Izze Sparkling Pomegranate juice. Between the four of us the case only lasted two days. The flavor is crisp and dry with a hint of club soda flavor. I think these could be used as an ingredient for a great wine cooler.
0,"If the can wasn't labeled ""pomegranate,"" I wouldn't have known what flavor it was.  This drink is very fizzy and tastes tangy and vaguely citrusy like Sprite or the old Fresca, but I definitely didn't taste pomegranate.  The ingredients list a blend of six fruit juices, and it's pretty much a muddle, in my opinion.<br /><br />There is no added sugar and each 8 ounce can has 80 calories.  This drink might be a good substitute for an alcoholic drink served in a pretty glass, or as a base for punch, but I wouldn't choose it as a thirst-quencher or when I want a true juice flavor."
0,"I had never tried Pomegranate before so I just gave this a shot and it's nasty stuff.<br />If you don't like the tartness of a grapefruit (I don't), then this isn't for you. About as tart as I can go is an orange and this is about 100000% worse.<br /><br />This is also entirely natural and has no sugars added which in my opinion contribute to why I can't stand it... Just entirely too tart!"
1,"Izze's pomegranate juice is almost perfect--good can size, not too sparkling, and a great flavor.  I like this much more than Pom Wonderful (maybe because of the carbonated nature of Izze).<br /><br />Important note:  While pomegranate juice may offer some health benefits, it can also interact with some medications, including ACE inhibitors and antihypertensive drugs, so check with your doctor before drinking pomegranate juice if you're taking prescription drugs.<br /><br />Two suggestions:  (1) More pomegranate flavor; and (2) market a sweetened version as well."
0,"I was drinking a bottle or two of these per day to help me lose weight (these got me off Pepsi).  I began to have very bad skin pain and muscle pain in my side and arms, wrists after about 2 weeks of drinking these.  I was going to the doctor for the pain and was about to be diagnosed with Fibromyalgia.  I started an elimination diet as a last resort because I had not always had this pain (only recently).  After stopping the Izze drinks just by chance because I ran out and the store I was getting them at did not have the flavors I liked, the pain went away.  This pain was very bad.  I was becoming a person who could not have my children or spouse hug or touch me.  My clothes hurt where they touched my sides.  It hurt to sleep and lay on the mattress with my side.  I may be the only person to experience this and realize it may be some kind of allergy to some product in this drink."
1,"I must admit that, being the ripe old age of 31 and part-time middle-school teacher, I didn't quite understand the kids' fascination with Izze drinks.  They bright juice color and brighter, young-looking packaging caused me to theorize that these drinks were just the same-old stuff with a clever marketing angle.<br /><br />Then I tried one.<br /><br />The quality of the product is certainly outstanding.  Pomegranate is a trendy flavor these days, yet many of the pomegranate-flavored products on the market don't adequately reflect the fruit's unique flavor.  Izze, as it says on the can, ""stays true to the fruit"" and it is evident in the fact that their pomegranate drink actually tastes like pomegranate.  The flavor is full, yet not overpowering, and the flavor tends to stay in your mouth for some time.  Although the product is made with carbonated water, there is certainly no ""coca-cola"" quality to it.  There is not excessive carbonation, but rather the light carbonation of the water tends to enhance the flavor of the juice itself--yet another way in which Izze stays true to the fruit.<br /><br />It appears as if the middle-schoolers have a more refined taste than I gave them credit for.  Izze Pomegranate drink is excellent.  I highly recommend this product and will be sure to keep it around the house, myself."
1,"Despite the fact that Izze Sparkling Pomegranate juice beverage has 19g of sugar, it is not too sweet. In fact, it has a very refreshing fruity taste, which is enhanced by the light carbonation.<br /><br />It's made from concentrates of juices, including apple, white grape, pineapple, lemon, cranberry and pomegranate. The rest of the mix is comprised of sparkling water, fruit & vegetable coloring, and added vitamins like C & B6 (very small amounts).<br />Even though it contains lemon and cranberrry juice concentrates, it isn't too tart.<br /><br />All in all, it's a nice alternative to soda. And here's a little extra something I experimented with: mixed with a little wine (I used Sangria) it made a great wine cooler! ;)<br /><br />It's also low sodium and has just 80 calories per 8.4 fl. oz. All this and the fact that the Izze company does philanthropic/educational work for needy kids, and you've got a winning product."
1,"This is a fizzy, refreshing fruit soda with natural sweetening limited to whatever the 70% juice content can provide. So this is a slightly sweet-sour soda with no cloying taste and it tastes exactly like what it is--pomegranate juice. This is more in the tradition of the European ""lemonades""--fizzy water and fruit juice with little or no sugar.<br /><br />The can is the size of one of those energy drinks. (8oz.) If you like a fizzy drink now and then, I can't think of anything better. I don't drink soda, diet or regular (no point to either.) Izze, however, is quite nice. Try it."
1,"This review focuses on the pomegranate and grapefruit flavors of Izze.<br /><br />Izze's all natural sparkling juice is a nice alternative to soda.  There is no caffeine, no processed sugar, and no unnatural ingredients.  It is refreshing to read the ingredients and find that I recognize every ingredient!  And they are all safe!<br /><br />The pomegranate juice is mixed in with a bit of grape and apple juice, to mitigate a mild (but not unpleasant) bitter citrus aftertaste, somewhat like grapefruit juice.  The sparkle has a feel closer to sparkling water than to carbonated soda -- and I like that.  It is a distinctive flavor -- and I like that too.  I wasn't sure what to think after just one can, but after trying it a couple of times I have found that it is quite nice.<br /><br />I liked the ruby red grapefruit flavor all at once -- it has the perfect grapefruit flavor, the sweet tangy delicious zing, without the bitter aftertaste of grapefruit.  It is not too sweet, but just right for that grapefruit flavor fix that I like now and again.  This is the perfect size container, especially for my kids who also love the grapefruit flavor.  Good stuff.<br /><br />What I also like is that Izze appears to be a company with a conscience.  Started by a couple of friends in 2003 who liked the idea of an all natural and distinctive beverage as an alternative to soda, Izze uses their product as a platform from which to promote awareness of the Global Education Fund (and other good causes, both environmental and global) that they support."
1,"Pomegranate: My first sip of Izze's Sparkling Pomegranate was not appreciated by my palate very much; I thought it tasted like someone had mixed a wine cooler with beer. I actually did a double take to look at the can and search for alcohol content. By the end of the can I liked it, and by the 3rd can I really liked it. It's tangy, fresh, with no sweet aftertaste and has a cool looking container design (aesthetics always matter!).<br /><br />With a total of 80 calories per cute little can, this isn't exactly what you'd call a ""diet drink,"" but I find it to be surprisingly filling, so it makes a great in-between liquid snack, and can stave away the hunger pangs until your next meal without doing damage to your diet.<br /><br />Overall a nifty drink in a most attractive can. Don't let the first taste fool you. Izze's Pomegranate Fizzy is quite yummy...a very pleasurable acquired taste.<br />.......................................<br />Grapefruit: Izze's Sparkling grapefruit is absolutely the best drink in a can I have ever tasted. Nothing is even a close 2nd. Tangy and refreshing, its lemony grapefruit flavor is quite strong and tantalizing. It also contains white grape, apple and orange juice from concentrates, but what my taste buds remember most is the lemon and grapefruit. The Grapefruit flavor has 90 calories per can, for those counting calories, but like the Pomegranate, it's very filling, and does well as an ""in-between"" snack for dieters.<br /><br />This wonderful Izze fizzy is addictive. On a hot day cold Sparkling Grapefruit is a total delight, and since it does not have refined sugars it truly takes away your thirst, not like those soda pop drinks that actually seem to make one thirstier. Thank you Izze, your Sparkling Grapefruit gets the gold award for canned beverage in my house.<br />If you're into ""hard likker,"" Izze's Grapefruit would make the perfect mixer, for vodka or tequila."
0,"I've enjoyed Izze drinks in the past and for the past year and a half have been drinking pomegranate juice whenever I get the chance.  When I learned about Izze's FORTIFIED ALL NATURAL SPARKLING POMEGRANATE JUICE, I was rather excited at the prospect of tasting some. I was rather disappointed.  To begin with, even though this product is labeled as pomegranate juice, it's a misnomer because this is not real pomegranate juice.  Instead it's a hybrid containing juices from concentrates of apples, white grapes, pineapples, lemons, cranberries, pomegranates, and a few other added vitamins.  The other vitamins don't bother me so much, but when a product is labeled and marketed as pomegranate juice, that's what a person should expect to get, not a mixture of a bunch of juices only one of which is pomegranate.  Besides the false labeling, the drink is quite bitter and hard to drink.  Drinking the beverage straight from the cans doesn't quite cut it (it tastes a bit metallic) and I've had to pour the stuff in a glass with ice.  Perhaps the absorption of the ice takes away part of the bitterness, but I've found the drink tastes much better this way.  But, overall, you'd best just avoid buying the stuff altogether."
1,"First impressions of IZZE Pomegranate (that's a funny word if you say it too many times):<br /><br />Attractive packaging and accurate descriptions on the labels with one exception. On the logo side of the can it says ""Pure Fruit Juice"", and I know this is childish, but then it says ""& sparkling water fortified with vitamins."" Well, that's hardly pure fruit juice. It has other stuff in it too. However, IZZE Beverages redeem themselves by actually not adding refined sugars or caffeine to the drink. This is something I can give to my children and not worry about Child Protective Services hunting me down. I was surprised to see that pomegranate (funny word!) is not the main ingredient. It's sixth on the list. Apple, white grape, clarified pineapple, lemon, cranberry and then pomegranate (teehee). I guess ""Sparkling Pomegranate"" sounded better to the marketing department than ""Bubbly Clarified Pineapple Juice"" (not funny sounding at all, which is also a definite negative in my personal selection of a thirst-quenching beverage).<br /><br />Taste. This is the good part. It's clean with a little sweet-tartness. Very nice balance and engages quite a few taste buds. It's fizzy and crisp. It kind of reminds me of the grape juice that I used to sneakily drink during church as a child, but with vitamin C, Niacin and B6. It has a nice, easy after taste that is not offensive like a few other drinks in this category.<br /><br />The profits. The company claims to be in partnership with the Global Education Fund ""to help provide educational opportunities and resources to needy children around the world."" And there's a kicker.<br /><br />The kicker: A lot of companies tout their philanthropic ventures. But with IZZE it appears that they actually do benefit humankind through a compassionate capitalism. The put their money to work! Employees, if the report is true, actually donate personal time for fund raisers and collect books in an IZZE vehicle. Those books are sent internationally to orphans and other needy children for their educational benefit. If you are involved with a school, you can partner with the Global Education Fund and do the same thing as IZZE. They are also involved in improving the ""quality of life for children with chronic and life-threatening medical conditions"" and programs promoting environmental responsibility and there's even more. Wow.<br /><br />And my two-year old loves it. She found a new treat. And now I have a new reward for positive behavior! bwahahahaha [pirate laugh]<br /><br />Great drink. Great company. I'm sold."
1,"At the time of reviewing, I liked the idea of a healthful juice product that isn't ""100% juice"" (read: acidic or overly sweet). On the other hand, I didn't like overly diluted juices with added sugar - natural or artificial - either. IZZE seemed to be the juice product that I was looking for. It contains no refined sugars or artificial sweeteners. It's 70% juice, so it tasted sufficiently fruity to me. Because it's not 100% juice (with sparkling water added, which gives it a mild ""kick""), to my palate it had just enough sweetness (from the juices themselves) and acidity. In addition, pomegranate juice seems to be renowned for its cancer-fighting properties. I considered this a healthful and tasteful juice product."
1,"*****<br />This Izze Pomegranate Sparkling Juice isn't a soda and isn't a juice---it's a healthy alternative drink that's a bit of a combination of the two. It comes in a small can (8.4 oz) that I enjoy in a wine glass (it's about the amount of liquid in a very large glass of wine).<br /><br />Some pomegranate juices are sour, but this one is tasty and sweeter than most...actually it tastes like real pomegranate pieces (arils) do---perfect! It is a sparkling juice, and sweetened just with real fruit. Technically, pomegranates are considered a ""superfood"", so this is a healthy way of improving your diet via beverage choice. It's also fortified with vitamins C and B6 and niacin as well.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"
1,"Izze is one of my favorite drinks. When I cut sodas out of my diet, I looked for something to replace them. Ultimately, I ended up drinking a lot of sparkling water. But when I need something a little sweeter, I found these and I adore them. It's real fruit juice and sparking water so it still has sugars in it - just not added/refined sugar. So it's a lot better for you and a lot fewer calories than downing a coke.<br /><br />I do have a couple of very minor complaints (but they're so minor, the product still gets 5 stars from me). I feel like the drink could actually have a little less juice and a little more sparkling water. Sometimes it's just a little too sweet for me. Also, these cans are a little small (smaller than a normal can of soda). However, I've found a really easy way around both of these. I pour the can into a glass and top it off with some plain sparking water. Perfect!<br /><br />All the flavors are good, but pomegranate is my favorite (however, I'm a huge fan of just about anything pomegranate)."
1,"Izze is like a freshly made italian soda, but with the convenience of being in a can. It's not super-sugary like a normal fruit-flavored pop and it has a lighter fizz (just the right amount, if you ask me). I tried the Pomegranate flavor, which I would describe more as a tart cherry/pomegranate blend. It has quickly become my beverage of choice when I open up the fridge. It's definitely more of a sparkling fruit juice than what you would think of as ""pop"". I highly recommend it!"
1,"It's often the simplest ideas that work the best. These Izze beverages aren't complicated at all - they're 70% fruit juice and 30% sparkling water - but they sure taste great. I enjoy pomegranate juice, but I never go through enough to make buying the jugs they sell at the supermarket worthwhile. That's where these Izze single-serving cans come in handy.<br /><br />The good: The 8 ounce can is a reasonable serving size, it only has 80 calories, there isn't any caffeine or added sugar, and it tastes great.<br /><br />The bad: I was expecting a bit more carbonation. Still, that's a minor complaint.<br /><br />The best: This juice makes a great mixer for your favorite adult beverage. I prefer it with vodka, but I imagine it would work fairly well with gin too.<br /><br />The verdict: Order a case! So far I've only tried the pomegranate juice, but I'll definitely be ordering more in the future."
1,"So far, I've tried the Pomegranate and the Blackberry.  Both are good, but I like the Pomegranate the best.<br /><br />This stuff is best served chilled or over ice.  Straight out of the can at room temperature, it has a sort of bitter/metallic after-taste but chilling seems to eliminate it.  I like the fact that it has no added sugar, preservatives, or caffeine.  It's a refreshing change from the usual carbonated stuff."
1,"Finally, a soda for  grown up, discerning tastes!  Great as a mixer too.<br />If you are looking for syrupy sweet, it ain't for you!"
1,"I remember when Izze was first introduced a few years back. I had it in Chicago and I immediately fell in love with it. The great packaging and the great taste made me consider it the gourmet version of sparkling water. Now they have done it again ?!  it is hard to believe that anyone can make something great even better, but they did it!<br /><br />The new fortified version is so refreshing that you can drink can after can and not get tired of it. My kids loved it, my girlfriend loved it, my mom loved it. This was a hit at our house. I wish that I had a chance to try the other flavors this was so good. Izze undeniably has a winner on their hands."
1,"Izze's Pomegranate Sparkling Juice tastes great.  The cans are a bit smaller(8.4 oz)than your usual soda can(12 oz).  The pomegranate flavor is there, but there's another fruity flavor in there somewhere that I just can't really identify.  The drinks are good but from the can it looks as if it would some sort of ""health drink"".  I got the impression that this would be a low-to-no calorie beverage but each little can packs a pretty decent 80 calories.  So, if you are counting calories, Izze's might not be for you.  Otherwise, they are pretty good."
1,"Want a little sparkle in your glass?  Izze Sparkling Juice is the answer to a splash of fun in your summer cocktails and mocktails.<br /><br />I tried this straight, with twists of lemon and lime, and with vodka.  It is refreshing as an iced beverage all on its own.<br /><br />Which made me curious...if this is a distinctive sparkling pomegranate juice, how will it combine with Tanqueray, an aromatic gin?  (This is all in the name of research...)  It was a no contest win for Izze, as the flavors mixed well together, and my guests enjoyed a refreshing cocktail.<br /><br />I also like the size...slender enough to be stacked in our fridge or thrown into a picnic basket.  This is a versatile drink that is refreshing and fun.  It is sure to be a regular in our fridge."
1,"Pomegranate and Grapefruit<br /><br />Izze sodas are refreshing and not overly sweet.  There calorie content is almost identical to regular soda but because they have a natural tartness, they don't taste as sweet.  So this is not a way to reduce your caloric intake except that the cans are smaller than regular soda cans.  With 70% fruit juice you might expect that Izze sodas would have more Vitamin C but the fruit juices used in Izze are mostly grape and apple.  For the pomegranate flavor, pomegranate is the 6th fruit juice listed.<br /><br />So why drink Izze?  The main reason is that it a tasty change from colas.  There are many flavors and you are sure to find one that you like."
1,"I received a case of this sparkling pomegranate juice and suggested that several members of my family (pre-teens, teens, and adults) try it.  Depending on the particular tastes of each individual, ratings went from 3 to 5 stars.<br /><br />This is a satisfying and nutritious alternative to soda, especially during the warmer months of the year.  Members of my family agree:  this is a product we would buy."
1,"This is a really nice product for those who want to consume healthful things. Refreshing, tasty and guiltless beverages are too few and far between these days, but this qualifies.<br /><br />Far too many ""vitamin drinks"" on the shelf are packed with empty calories, high-fructose corn syrup, and no actual fruit juice (or anything else good for you, for that matter). This is a refreshing exception.<br /><br />The pros: 70% juice, not overly calorie-ridden, the Izze drinks DO contain a bit of Vitamins C, B6 and Niacin, but do NOT contain any dreaded (and seemingly ubiquitous) high-fructose corn syrup (about which I have heard nothing good. Not one thing), and it tastes really good.<br /><br />The cons: Okay, not so much a con perhaps, but one should be aware that the product contains no more than 10% of the RDA of any of the aforementioned vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />So as long as you don't think of it as a magic health elixir, but rather as a great-tasting, refreshing drink that appears to contain nothing bad for you, I think you will enjoy this drink as much as I have."
1,"Izze is a great concept, especially as this is one soda that is actually a little healthier than the usual carbonated beverages. I ordered the Pomegranate and Grapefruit and preferred the latter much more.<br /><br />Pomegranate: I love Pomegranate juices like Pom and other organic alternatives available [...] as it is a very heart healthy drink. However, despite my liking for the tart taste, the Izze pomegranate juice in cans has a slightly bitter after taste and does not taste as good as real pomegranate juice. It may be due to the dilution or just because this pomegranate juice is ""adulterated"" with more cranberry juice than pomegranate! It does state on the can that it is a mixture of several juices like grape, pineapple, cranberry. However, since the can said pomegranate I was expecting the juice to be primarily pomegranate and I feel slightly cheated if I taste more cranberry. It would be nice to see more information on the can about the proportion of pomegranate juice in this juice mix.<br /><br />Since I found this juice to be a little too bitter, I tried making a ""Pom-cosmo-tini"", essentially a Cosmopolitan using Izze Pom and it turned out quite delicious. Now I know where the rest of the case is going, time to throw a party!<br /><br />Grapefruit: This one tasted a whole lot better and has none of the bitter after taste of the Pomegranate. It tastes more like real grapefruit although this is also a mix of several juices.<br /><br />In a taste test, I asked my friends to try the Pom and the Grapefruit. Everyone was excited to see the stylishly slim can but no one liked the Pom flavor. In fact one person said it tasted like cough syrup and poured it down the sink. My daughter also rejected the Pomegranate after one sip and finished half the grapefruit can. I was hoping she'd like Izze a bit more so I could give her some to drink at school, I believe the Apple and the Blackberry flavors are sweeter so I'll try those next."
1,"Wow.  That was the first thing that came to mind when I opened one of these and tried it.  Not only was it delicious and thirst-quenching, but it was also good for me and didn't come loaded down with sugars.  I was very impressed at both the flavor and the content.<br /><br />So many beverages nowadays are just loaded with sugar and other artificial flavorings.  Then we wonder why we are getting so overweight in this country.  Izze has turned the tables on all that and uses only the natural sweetness of the fruits to sweeten up the drinks.  At 80 calories a pop, those 80 calories are actually something good for your body and not just junk calories!<br /><br />I noticed after I drink one that my thirst quickly goes away.  Again, this comes back to the fact they aren't loading the drink down with sugar.  It is a great after-workout drink because it really does help quench that deep-down thirst.<br /><br />At first I was concerned about the small size, but you soon find out that they are just perfect for one serving.  Instead of tempting you to overindulge like most soft drinks, this one actually gives you ONE serving and ONE serving only.<br /><br />A great product and one that is good for you -- how can you go wrong?"
1,"This product reminds me of cranberry juice and tonic water.  If that sounds good to you then you'll love this drink.  This flavor makes a good mixer too.  Personally I love this mixed with dark rum.<br /><br />This drink is not artificially sweetened, so it tastes a bit tart compared with sodas and traditional fruit juice.  Personally I find this refreshing; there's WAY too much sugar and artificial sweeteners in most of our drinks and food."
1,"I refrigerated the cans as soon as they arrived as I prefer chilled juice beverages. Upon opening the can, I noticed a release of gas. The details on the can indicate there is sparkling water, aka carbonated water much like soda. Rather than being a pure pomegranate juice drink, there is a mix of other juices: apple, white grape, pineapple, lemon, cranberry, and pomegranate. I could easily detect the cranberry and apple, followed by grape and lemon. The pineapple and pomegranate was extremely subtle. The drink is far from being sweet and tastes much like apple/cranberry juice. My only complaint is that the cans are rather small. If they were 12 ounce cans or of larger volume, I would have enjoyed it for a longer period of time. The Izze Pomegranate juice is advertised to not contain any refined sugars, caffeine, or preservatives. Overall, this is the perfect chilled beverage for relaxing outside during the summer."
1,"We rarely have soda in our house. We've got three teenagers at home and although they'd like to have it around, it doesn't fit in with our ongoing attempt to eat healthy. :-)<br /><br />Izze's sparkling pomegranate is a great alternative and all the kids loved it.  My husband and I did too. It's a mixture of 70% fruit juice with sparkling water and vitamins added. It has no refined sugar and most importantly no high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />The can is an 8.4 oz. size, smaller then your normal soda but really a perfect size in my opinion. It got a thumbs up all around.<br /><br />The pomegranate flavor was tangy, not too sweet and delicious. I'm looking forward to trying some of the other Izze flavors too for a non-soda soft drink treat for the family. Highly recommended!"
1,"The Pomegranate flavor of Izze sparkling juice is a great choice for refreshment.  It contains 70% real juice, including a variety of juices one of which is pomegranate.  They remind me a bit of an italian soda.  It's nice to have a cold beverage option that is so natural and high on taste while being very refreshing.  The absence of any artificial additives or anything really unhealthy make this an all around great choice.  I really like them.<br /><br />The Blackberry flavor is even better, it has a really nice sweetness to it.<br /><br />I haven't tried any other flavors yet."
1,"I like soda. I definitely drink too much of it, but it's one of the last I-know-how-bad-it-is-for-me things I allow myself in a time when most of the foods and drinks you see in the supermarket can best be described as ""mild poison."" Books and documentaries keep popping up telling us just how bad the foods are that we consume (Supersize Me, Fast Food Nation, The Omnivore's Dilemma, etc.), and one of the big offenders is the insidious high fructose corn syrup. They put it in everything, it seems, especially beverages. (Its worst aspect is that it blocks the receptors in your brain that tell you you're full and should stop eating or drinking, so you continue feeling hungry and eating and drinking more and more.) So it's refreshing to have a drink that's got a nice sweet flavor without this awful sweetener. Tastes will vary, but I found this pretty nice, and pomegranate's a flavor you don't normally see as a soda - or, ""sparkling juice"" - so I'd say this is worth a try. At the very least, it's more interesting than another boring ol' cola or lemon-lime soft drink.<br /><br />A note on the Clementine variety:<br />These Izze drinks are really quite nice. In addition to the lack of high fructose corn syrup, which is a major plus, they use really interesting flavors. This clementine flavored sparkling juice is cool variation. I thought it might taste more like a Sunkist-style orange soda, but it really doesn't. The clementine flavor is very distinctive. I don't think I've ever had a soda quite like it. Tastes great, very tangy, not nearly as sweet as I would have expected. A nice, cool drink for the spring.<br /><br />A note on the Grapefruit variety:<br />Much the same as the others, this is a nice change of pace for a fizzy drink. This is my wife's favorite flavor, though for me it's got a little less zest than I would have expected. Still, it fits nicely with the other flavors."
1,"This is a very refreshing, slightly tart carbonated drink. It tastes exactly as one would expect. Albeit a bit pricey, the quality of ingredients makes up for it. Whenever I get a craving for a soda pop type drink this definitely takes care of that craving. I plan to order the Black Cherry flavor next."
1,"My husband fell in love with the IZZE brand when he decided to give up soda last year.  I teased him at first that giving up soda for another kind of soda was pointless, but after trying these myself I am sold.  IZZE contains all natural ingredients and no artificial sweeteners--its only fruit juice and sparkling water!  It gives you the satisfaction of a bubbly drink without all of the bad things.  Low calorie and great flavor.  Our local stores only have a few of the flavors available, so we have not tried all of the different kinds, but so far pomegranate is our favorite.  We prefer the glass bottle drinks to the cans, but again they are hard to find locally.  I purchased this 24 pack on Amazon when I couldn't find any at Walmart.  I will buy more cases from Amazon in the future."
1,"Love the drink.  Been drinking diet soda ever since, well, since diet soda came out.  Have not had a soda or artificial sweeteners for a week now.  Thought this would be a good alternative since I'm mostly addicted to the carbonation.  The flavor is mild but I think you can basically make your own by buying your favorite fruit juice and sparkling water.  I was also shocked by Amazon's price.  I bought the 24 pack at Costco for $13. I gave it 5 stars because it is really good if you want to spend the money on it."
1,"I not only enjoyed every can of this flavored sparkling water, I also enjoyed every zip of it! I recommend it. It is a reasonable price, perhaps not the cheapest but it is definitely worth it! There's no doubt that I will recommend it...."
1,This is easily my favorite fruit flavored soda. There is a perfect blend of citrus and sweetness in every single can. The only thing I would change is to increase the amount of soda in each can. Or make it cheaper... This is so refreshing to drink after a long day at work.
1,Absolutely love the Izze sparkling pomegranate drink.  It is much healthier for you than regular sodas.  Taste is great.  This is the only drink compatible to soda but none of the unhealthy issues.  This goes great in the pomegranite margaritas....LOVE IT...Was only available from Target and used to buy it by the case.  They no longer sell it.  Price is much better on Amazon plus no tax and free shipping.  Has a sharp fruity taste...If you get the chance to try one you will be hooked.  By the way I grew up not drinking sodas...
1,"These cans are a notch below the flavor of the Izze in the bottles, but buying the cans by the case is much more economical.  And drinking 8oz rather than 12oz is the lower calorie choice. Glad to find these cases at amazon.com"
1,"I first bought this beverage a couple of years ago on a whim, since I was getting bored of drinking just water and Dr Pepper all the time. Needless to say, it certainly did the trick: it's much healthier for you than pop, yet still tasty enough to not miss Dr Pepper."
0,I bought the whole pack because I liked the IZZE grapefruit sparkling juice. Great disappointment after the first taste. It doesn't taste like natural pomegranate.
1,"I buy IZZE when it's on sale on Amazon. This Pomegranate flavor is pretty good. If you're looking for pure Pomegranate juice this is not it - go buy that Pom Wonderful stuff. This is a pomegranate flavored sparkling juice - with different juices mixed together. It's not too sweet, kinda tart, and very refreshing. To me the taste is a cross between pomegranate and cranberry. It's 70% fruit juice and 30% water - that's it. No added ingredients that you can't pronounce, none of that corn syrup stuff that everyone is scared about and no added sugar. I really like it."
1,"IZZE has seemed to find the balance between healthy fruit taste and the sensation of carbonated soft drinks with their sparkling juice line.  I haven't had a soft drink in over a year since discovering these wonderfully refreshing, healthy alternatives to carbonated soft drinks.  Since it's pure fruit juice, it's also naturally weet (but not too sweet) so it also satisfies that ""sweet tooth"" as well.  Although not a substitute for plain ol' H2O, this beverage definitely satisfies and quenches my thirst.  Can't get enough of these beverages......."
1,This is the best alternative to soda ever.  It is light and fresh.  It is smaller so you consume less and it perks you up when you drink it because it is so refreshing.
1,"Upon first trying this drink, I was somewhat put off. I've never had pomegranate anything, but based on other reviews I decided to give it a try. It tasted different, for sure, but after the first one, I realized I was having to limit myself to 2 cans a day. I guess it's an acquired taste, but once acquired, you'll never have enough! I love these things, and can't wait to try the other flavors."
1,My son loves this drink and it is much better than soda. It's a little pricey but very good.
1,"My son and I each start our mornings off with a can of this delicious, low-cal fizzy drink.  It has a great fruity flavor and is better than a glass of juice or soda!"
1,"Izzes are relatively low in calories, no added sugar, and are natural.  They are basically sparkling natural fruit juice.  Pomegranate is a great flavor, harder to find than some of the others.  I also really like grapefruit, blackberry and clementine orange Izzes.  Pear is great but I haven't been able to find it for quite some time."
1,"I tried two flavors of these Izze cans - Clementine and Pomegranate.<br /><br />What I like: Real juice - no artificial sweeteners or high fructose corn syrup. Better for you than a soda. The smaller serving size is just right and the can is a comfortable shape to hold. I liked both of these flavors, with the Pomegranate coming out slightly ahead. Both were a nice mix of tart and sweet. They also make great vodka mixers.<br /><br />What could be better: These really need to be cold to be at their best in flavor and fizz. I often prefer drinks to be room-temp because my teeth can be cold-sensitive. If you're looking for a fizz fix, then there are flavored, unsweetened sparkling waters out there that would satisfy without any calories at all.<br /><br />Miscellaneous notes: As others have said before, be aware that the flavor juice is not necessarily the main juice (pomegranate), or even present at all (clementine). They're not a complete source of the fortified vitamins, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />It all comes down to what you're looking for. Looking for a sparkling juice that's relatively good for you? This is an excellent and recommended answer."
1,"My husband and I tried the pomegranate, which is tart and refreshing, but as I don't drink soda at all, I tasted a bit too much sugar for my taste. But something in the flavor put us in a creative frame of mind, and we decided to have a little fun. So we tried Izze pomegranate and vodka, Izze pomegranate and gin, and then both of these with some OJ. The OJ adds a definite sweet/citrus taste and is quite refreshing with or without the alcohol. This is how we named and rated them:<br /><br />1. Pomegranate/OJ/gin--a Bloody Orange<br />2. Pomegranate/gin--a Gin Izze<br />3. Pomegranate/OJ/vodka--an Izze Navel<br />4. Pomegranate/vodka--a Dizzy Izze<br /><br />Try them this summer!"
1,"Soft drinks and sparkling water drinks rarely meet over due to their nature. Increasingly, like San Pellegrino, companies have decided to use a simple sparkling water and fruit juice blend to keep sugar contents down and your palatte refreshed.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Izze drinks for a while, but I really really like this Pomegranated Flavored Sparkling Juice. I have always been a fan of mixing almost anything with club soda or mineral water (tonic water has too much sugar... have you read the calories?)  to cut down the bite of some of the stronger juices and alcohols. Izze has done a nice job here. The pomegranate juice still retains it's acidic bite while the bubbly mineral water smoothens it out at the end. At 8.4 ounces, it's a nice little glass of juice and a perfect mid afternoon refresher with cheese or fruits. I'll be buying a few more packs of these!"
1,"Izze makes some very good juices, and advertises that their juice contains nothing other than fruit juice and sparkling water.  These are undoubtedly far, far better for you than, say, a Coke or a Pepsi.  They taste better and are more refreshing, and they certainly have a more natural feel to them.<br /><br />My only complaint is that, like many juices that claim to be all fruit juice, the vast majority of the juice in this particular blend appears to be apple and grape, which are much sweeter fruits in comparison with the tarter flavors.  Everyone knows pomegranate is good for you, but my guess is that the percent of this juice that is actual pomegranate is quite small--perhaps as low as 2 or 3 percent--and so contrary to what other reviewers have said, any health advantages are quite minimal.<br /><br />All that being said, these are certainly a superior option to other soft drinks.  Just don't think these are as good as water."
1,"I think the warnings about drug interactions should have no bearing on the product review. Obviously, if you're on a certain medication with known food interactions, you need to be cautious of certain foods. That shouldn't effect how we rate those products for the rest of the world. Medication concerns aside, the drink is very fruity, and refreshing. It is a very nice alternative to plain fruit juice or soda, and far healthier since soda contains no nutrition whatsoever.  This does taste very much like a fresh fruit juice spritzer with authentic flavor, not artificial in any way.  It doesn't have a ""canned"" taste as some fruit drinks in cans do.  I would have liked it to be a tad sweeter, but accomplished that by adding a splash of fresh fruit juice or a flavored syrup such as Torani. The flavor of the product itself is akin to an Italian soda.  I withheld one star because I thought the product straight from the can was a little overly ""fuzzy"" but fares well when poured over ice.  For those trying the pomegranate flavor, be forewarned that this is a ""blend"" including other fruit juices, not straight pom.  The flavor of pomegranate is still plentiful, but not like drinking it straight.  Overall, I think this would make a wonderful addition to the summer picnic cooler or to serve guests at a dinner party. Served in glasses, rather than a can, it would make an impressive dinner beverage to accompany an elegant meal for guests. I would recommend it."
1,"Although a little bitter, I do like the IZZE sparkling pomegranate carbonated fruit drink.  With a case of 24, I was able to share and get the opinions of friends and co-workers as well.  They noted the bitter taste but one friend mentioned how that could lend itself to be excellent in a mixed drink...come up with your own cool creation.<br /><br />Carbonated fruit drinks are always my favorite. I always mix ginger ale or club soda with my fruit juices.  It's especially great cold.  For me, the 8.4 oz size is perfect.  I tend to waste when I have 10 oz or more.<br /><br />This is something I would definitely buy and I would love to try the other flavors.  In addition, I love that IZZE has partnered w/Global Education Fund to help children around the world. A good drink, great cause...wonderful combination."
1,"In a nutshell this is a refreshing drink. It is sparkling and has pomegranate juice in it. It is a bit tart in a good, thirst quenching kind of way.<br /><br />Not only do I like it, but my seven year old child loves it too.<br /><br />I prefer to chill it and to pour it into a glass before serving."
1,"I wish this product wasn't made from concentrate, but this type of drink is so new, eventually someone will do it.  Having said that, this IS refreshing and delicious drink.  The small size is perfect.  Mine even arrived cold!"
1,"In the Beginning there was Fruit Juice, and there was Soda Pop, and never the twain should meet... unless you mixed them yourself.  But then somebody got the Great Idea -- when reconstituting fruit juice after Pasteurization, why not reconstitute it with carbonated water?  Thus was born...<br /><br />Soda Juice!<br /><br />And I tasted it, and it was Good!  Apple and Blackberry were both rather mild tasting; Clementine and Grapefruit a little stronger and more tart; and Pomegranate had the strongest taste.  I'd say Pomegranate and Grapefruit were my favorites, but I enjoyed all of them.<br /><br />In the cans you have 5 flavor choices: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYY1E"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Apple, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXYW"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Blackberry, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXTC"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Grapefruit, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXQK"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Pomegranate, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  The only difference between Izze in the cans and Izze in the bottles, other than the obvious of size and container, is that only Izze in the cans is fortified with vitamins: C, B6, and Niacin, plus the fact that currently <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NUBTQQ"">Izze Sparkling Blueberry Soda (12 ounce)</a> and Izze Sparkling Peach Soda (12 ounce) are only available in bottles.<br /><br />Since virtually nothing is added, the slight nutritional differences must be due to the characteristics of the different juices being used.  Apple, Blackberry, and Grapefruit have the highest calories, 90, Clementine and Pomegranate the lowest, 80.  Apple, Blackberry, and Clementine have the highest sodium, 15mg; Grapefruit and Pomegranate the lowest, 10mg.  Apple and Blackberry have the highest total carbohydrates, 21; Clementine, Grapefruit, and Pomegranate the lowest, 20.  Finally Apple has the highest sugars, 21g; Blackberry and Grapefruit are next, 20g; and Clementine and Pomegranate the lowest, 19g.<br /><br />Note: as other reviewers have already mentioned, all of these are fruit juice blends so those with fruit juice health concerns need to be aware of more than just the title juice.  All contain white grape, apple, and lemon juice.  In addition to their title juices Blackberry contains raspberry; Grapefruit contains orange; and Pomegranate contains clarified pineapple and cranberry juice.<br /><br />Compare and Contrast: a similar product is worth considering: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BDDHPQ"">essn Sparkling Blood Orange & Cranberry Juice, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BDHBWG"">essn Sparkling Fuji Apple Juice, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001687ZT4"">essn Sparkling Mango & Passion Fruit, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BDGA5A"">essn Sparkling Meyer Lemon Juice, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, essn Sparkling Minneola Tangerine Juice, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24), and essn Sparkling Pomegranate & Montmorency Cherry Juice, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24).  The difference?  The essn products lack the vitamin fortification, have a higher carbonated water to juice ratio, and have roughly twice the calories, total carbohydrates, and sugars of the Izze products, probably because they contain the fruit pulp, which the Izze products do not."
1,"I've been a fan of IZZE drinks for some time.  The taste is sophisticated, the ingredients are natural, and the stuff is pretty to look at in a clear glass.  It's casual enough to drink with your lunchtime sandwich but it wouldn't be out of place served with H'ors deurves or in a nicer setting in place of sparkling water or wine.<br /><br />For this flavor, pomegranate juice is several entries into the ingredient list.  That means the pomegranate flavor is not very pronounced (though it's there), which may be a good thing since the juice normally packs a major flavor punch.<br /><br />I'd describe the carbonation as light-to-medium, pleasant like sparkling water rather than burn-y like Coke.<br /><br />This drink is now labeled ""Fortified"" but tastes the same to me as the previous non-fortified version; some additional vitamins have been added according to the label.<br /><br />Other thoughts: It's nice to see a reasonably sized portion (both in quantity and calories, only 80) in this era of supersized food, and supersized people.  The lightweight aluminum can is an enviro-friendly way to package drinks.  Recycle it!"
1,"If you're like me, you try to steer clear of colas and especially anything with high fructose corn syrup, yet you're a bit nervous of the calorie count from, say, orange juice, and you like a bit of sparkle to your drinks, as well. When I saw IZZE, it looked like the ideal solution. It's got a bit of fizz, real fruit juices, and a few vitamins. At 80 calories per 8.4 oz can, it won't break your diet, and it doesn't have any high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />So, how does it taste?<br /><br />Actually, it's pretty good. The pomegranate flavor gives it a nice tang without being overwhelming. The carbonation is light, just enough to give the drink a bit of extra zip without being threatening to overwhelm your stomach. And IZZE is sweet enough that I can enjoy it as a sort of reward for a workout, without being sticky or overly-sweet the way some traditional soft drinks can be.<br /><br />As a test, I tried one can at room temperature--it's a test I won't repeat. But served nicely chilled and straight out of the refrigerator or over ice, IZZE is an enjoyable treat--without completely busting the calorie count."
1,"We first started buying Izze drinks when my wife was pregnant and she was looking for alternatives to soda and coffee. The Izze products were among her favorites -- especially the Black Cherry flavor. The Pomegranate variety is tasty as well, consisting of 70% fruit juice and 30% sparkling water. They make for a refreshing drink, although not a very large one (just over 8 ounces). One thing to note is that these drinks have 80 calories each, so that is something to be aware of. They're better than soda, but are far from calorie-free."
1,"Wow!  Izze is a bright taste indeed.  Major Plus Factors: It is neither too sweet, too heavy, or loaded with any kind of additives. It is a healthful drink and this factor alone makes it ideal for people who search for alternatives to those ghastly flavored, carbonated sugar water soft drinks like coke or pepsi, etc, or other type of fruit drinks loaded with high fructose corn syrup which create false hunger and are so toxic to the liver.  AND, Izze is FREE of the dangerous caffeine junk that fries your nervous system like some of those such as red bull, etc. guzzled by silly ""celebrities"".  Izze is carbonated which works for my husband, albeit it is not my personal preference.  That said, Izze is great in fruit smoothies adding a lift with the fizz. I experimented by adding it to regular, unsweetened Dole orange/pineapple fruit juice and it really punched up that concoction. My taste buds were twangin'! I also see this used to add zip to homemade fresh fruit sauces,(think all kinds of berries, peaches, apricots, etc) for use over ice cream or frozen yoghurt sundaes, or in fruit shakes, custards, and yummy syrups over pancakes and waffles. The fact that is has zero sugar is a major plus for diabetics as well as those who seek alternatives to sugar overload. For those who do want a sweeter taste, I suggest adding a mere eighth teaspoon of Xylitol which I use in place of sugar because it is healthful and tastes just like sugar. AND, Xylitol doesn't adds a single calorie. Nor will it skew blood sugar values or promote sugar high and low crashes. This small addition of Xylitol really punches up the overall taste.  Bottom Line: This family really likes Izze for it's clean, sparkling and light taste plus the health benefits of the pomegranate fruit in this specific drink."
1,"I'm not big on sodas, but I do like pomegranate juice, so thought I'd give this tasty beverage a try. It is indeed tasty, a mix of several juices and sparkling water. The more expensive pomegranate comes in fifth out of five juices in terms of content, but the pomegranate taste predominates. There are 80 calories in the 8.4 oz. can, so it's not like diet soda, but it's a refreshing alternative when you feel that you can stand a few calories."
1,"My family loves this product.<br /><br />My wife likes the small compactness, it's easy not only easy to carry but satisfying in flavor and the handy 8 oz amount.  Even our teenage son finds it refreshing and just sweet enough.<br /><br />The mix of pure fruit juice and sparkling water is nicely balanced and the fact that it is ""vitamin fortified"" is a plus factor. At the very least it helps rationalize drinking this tasty canned juice.  And who know, it might even be good for you!<br /><br />Personally, I am especially fond of the sparkling pomegranate and like to dilute it with an equal amount of club soda or just cool water.  It also makes a great mixer for all kinds of drinks, alcoholic or not.<br /><br />I hope this drink catches on and that other exotic flavors are added to the product line.<br /><br />Definitely recommended for those who like fruit flavored drinks in nice packaging and handy sized containers."
1,"My husband and I both tried Izze All Natural Sparkling Pomegranate Juice and here's what we think:<br /><br />First Impressions...<br />We are not sure we can taste the Pomegranate in it, but my husband definitely tastes apple juice which is really not surprising because that's at the top of the ingredient list, followed by grape juice and others. I like that it is not super-sweet and only sparkles moderately, quite pleasant and refreshing actually.<br /><br />Second Sips...<br />We both come to the conclusion that it almost has a wine-y taste, as if one were drinking an alcoholic beverage - maybe due to the grape juice? My husband also remarks that it would probably be great as a mix with alcohol, but let's not go there for the purpose of this review :-)<br /><br />Conclusions...<br />We like it better than we thought we would, especially my husband who at first was very skeptical of the idea of having to drink sparkling pomegranate juice. It is quite refreshing and a great thirst quencher on hot days although I am not sure that it is something other than a regular, not-so-sweet soda. I don't have much to say about the added vitamins - I, for one, don't need them but they likely won't hurt either.<br />We will probably buy this again from time to time, just for a change from the same-old sodas in our fridge..."
1,"I often take some juice and add a bit of seltzer to make my own more natural soda.  Now with Izze, I have a company that has taken that idea and created a line of sparkling beverages.  I just drank my first can of Sparkling Pomegranate.  I found the taste to be enjoyable, with just the right amount of fizz.  These are rather small cans, being tall and skinny and holding 8.4 oz.  There is very little sodium and no refined sugars, though natural sugar does amount to 19g for a can.  I liked the fact that it was all natural fruit juice.  The only thing to note is that this is not 100% Pomegranate, it is a mix of apple, white grape, pineapple and cranberry with pomegranate.  Very nice smooth taste and something I would purchase."
1,"I love pomemgranates and found that I really, really liked this flavour of the Izze sparkling juice. It's not too sweet or too fizzy, but just a good mix of that juice and sparkling water. I don't usually drink carbonated drinks, but this was a nice treat. Everyone else in my family really liked them, too."
1,"Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice is a refreshing drink with a tangy Pomegranate flavor that is not overly sweet. With fortification of vitamins, 70% fruit juice and only 80 calories per can, I will use this as a non-caffeine alternative to energy drinks for a quick, but healthier energy jolt. It was my first time tasting Izze, but now I intend to try other flavors too."
1,"I like that the soda is made from fruit juice but it is misleading in that it is not all pomegranate, it also has apple, white grape, pineapple, lemon, cranberry and the last on the list is pomegranate. If you like a sweet soda you probably won't like this since it is very tart, I was surprised at how tart this was. It has a good fizz to it and is 80 calories per can, the cans are only 8.4 oz so it is smaller than other types but is refreshing. I would recommend this soda since it is a healthy alternative to other types of soda."
1,"Izze's All-Natural Sparkling Pomegranate Juice is a good, tart juice.  It tastes great on its own, and would probably also work well as a mixer (with a small scoop of natural vanilla ice cream?) -- the possibilities are limitless.<br /><br />I just got this juice today, and decided to give it the most extreme test I have -- drinking some right after finishing a little bit of exercise.  I was very pleasantly surprised; after drinking this juice, I felt more refreshed and even a bit more filled than other juices of this type.  (And for a dieter, this is a big-time plus.)<br /><br />Note that this isn't a sweet juice; if you're seeking that, look elsewhere.<br /><br />However, as a natural juice (unsweetened by anything save the fructose of the fruit itself), it has a fine, full-bodied taste that is worth savoring over a tall glass of crushed ice.  It's a bit similar to natural cranberry juices; if you like those, you will like this.<br /><br />Four stars, recommended.<br /><br />Barb Caffrey"
1,"It's hard to go wrong with Izze. It's just like soda, except it's made with actual fruit juice. No sugar or artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />This particular blend is described as pomegranate, but it's a mix of apple, grape, pineapple, lemon, cranberry and pomegranate. Overall it's tart and refreshing, not too sweet. However, the taste of grape and cranberry rather overpowers the pomegranate. Also, with the recent focus on pomegranate as a particularly healthy juice, it would be nice if the pomegranate-to-everything-else ratio was higher, so I'm only going to give it 4 out of 5.<br /><br />As to the fortification, as with most fortified foods it's more of a selling point than something of real value. You're better off getting your vitamins from a healthy diet, or (if you must) a multivitamin tablet.<br /><br />However, I'll keep drinking Izze when I feel an urge to drink soda. It may not be the healthiest drink, but it's a lot healthier than the high fructose corn syrup and chemical flavorings sold by the two big name soda makers."
1,"So, I havent even seen this product in a store near where I live, but do like to try new foodstuffs- so I was happy to order it as part of the vine program.  I was a little trepidatious about drinking it at first, but decided to pop the top of seven or eight cans (not all at once!) and drink quite a few before I reviewed it.  Now that I have that out of the way I can write a quick review.<br /><br />This soda is different.  Different good. Its got a taste that reminds me of Red Bull without the caffeine buzz.  On first sip, its got a funky aftertaste like beer, but then delves into a more tart, bitter taste before the natural sugars of the fruit juice come into play.  It tastes more like cranberry than pomegranate to me, and the others that I have shared this soda with with agree with me on that point.<br /><br />True, its not full of artifical sugars and so this soda isnt a sweet taste like we are all used to with carbonated beverages.  Its more ""dry"" in flavor and tastes like fruit juice mixed with seltzer water.  Not a bad taste, mind you, but one that takes two or three cans before it grows on you.  I like this soda, and if the stores in my area ever decide to stock it, I will happily pick up a case and even adventure out into other flavors to try.  Heck, I might have to shop on Amazon so I can pick some up every now a then  :)<br /><br />I dont give this soda to my kids, because to me, it has a more ""grown-up"" flavor to it.  Its not sugary and sweet and syrupy like modern soda, but it does have a refreshing, fresh, tart flavor that is surprisingly good.  At 8.4 ounces per can, it is a bit smaller than the 12oz. sodas we usually see, but this wasnt even a issue to me.  I like this stuff and cant wait to try the other flavors.  Trust me on this, do not jude this stuff by the first can alone.  Drink a couple and then form your opinion.  Good stuff, a refreshing change from Coke and Pepsi products."
1,"This is by far the best of the Izze flavors.  It's light and delicious, and compared to the others I've tried (all but Apple) it easily tops the list.  The beverage is surprisingly thirst-quenching for such a slim, tiny bottle, and the best thing is that it's also quite versatile.  Too tired after work to break out multiple bottles and shake up a cocktail?  Just add two shots of your favorite brand of Vodka or Gin to one of these babies, cold out of the fridge, and drink up.  It's a light, fantastic way to relax.  The beauty of Izze drinks is that they aren't heavily carbonated like soda, so they don't really go flat, and they aren't heavily sugared like most juices, so they don't overwhelm your palette.  I couldn't recommend this product more highly.  Enjoy!"
1,"The Izze Pomegranate sparkling juice is a bit tart, but very tasty.  Along with pomegranate, there are the definite flavors of apple and cranberry juices, which make for a refreshing cocktail.  The can is small, but 8.4 ounces is just enough juice, and at only 80 calories per can, this is a better choice for dieters than many of the other sparkling juices on the market.<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to enjoying a cold, refreshing Izze on a hot Texas summer day, and I plan to check out all the juices in the Izze line.  Clementine is next!"
1,"Izze Sparkling Pomegranate is not too sweet, but it is just as refreshing and fun as sugary soft drinks. The cans are small and stylish, perfect for carrying in your purse or backpack. Kids like it, and the smaller size makes it a more sensible serving.<br />The company is ecologically and socially responsible, too.<br />What's more, this flavor is very nice with a touch of Cointreau for a sophisticated and festive cocktail.<br />An excellent alternative to sodas."
0,This drink was pretty flat.  Pretty much tasted like cranberry juice with a tiny bit of bubbles.  I've had the bottled versions before (not of this flavor) and thought they were much better.
1,I absolutely love this elixir! It is refreshing and delicious as well as good for you.
1,"I read about the benefits of pomegranate and I wanted something that was a little tart but refreshing, so I decided to try this drink. Boy, this beverage is great and with Subscribe & Save, I save money as well and free shipping also. I like it so much I decided to buy it twice a month. By the way I'm just a regular consumer and not affiliated in anyway with IZZE or Amazon."
1,These are my favorite of the fortified sparkling juice brands. The serving size is perfect. I saved both time and money having my IZZE delivered.
1,"If you are used to Hawaiian Punch, Snapple, sugary Kool-aid, or other ""fruity"" drinks, you won't find the same high fructose corn syrup kick in this product.  It actually tastes like real fruit juice...imagine that.<br /><br />I'll admit I like sweet fake-fruit drinks as much as the next person, so my first few sips of Izze's pomegranate sparkling water made me question my selection.  I had expected something more akin to lightly flavored water, but the taste was an overwhelming tartness.<br /><br />I have learned to enjoy though and wish my parents had given me this as a kid so that my tastebuds would consider this ""sweet"".  It is still a little strong and tart for me, so I mix it 1-to-1 with water.  Diluted by half is still enough flavor for me, so each 12 once can actually doubles in size when I drink it.<br /><br />Lastly, everything about the company suggests they will appeal to progressive-minded individuals, from their use of all natural products, their green endeavors (factories powered by wind) and their philanthropic operations."
1,"I've been enjoying my Izze Pomegranate juice, and I'll tell you why:<br /><br />1. It's crisp and refreshing. Since it is mostly fruit juice and carbonated water, the only sugar is naturally occuring in the juice.<br /><br />2. It has 70% real fruit juice. The benefits of that are spelled out on the nutritional facts label. 10% of your daily vitamin C, B6 and niacin is in every can.<br /><br />3. The absensce of high fructose corn syrup. That heavy, ubiquitous sugar substitute we find in nearly every processed food in America these days, especially in the soft drinks. Izze has none of that.<br /><br />One gripe - The cans are small at 8.4 ounces. That usually leaves me wanting more. It's an encouraging sign that people are willing to eat food in small quantities like this, but making these closer to the size of a typical soda can and adding another 20-30 calories would be great."
1,"*****<br />If you love bergamot (as I do) then this is your tea. Numi Tea is all high quality, and this aged Earl Grey is no exception. It is a strong, fine tea, and the bergamot is the star. I noticed that it has been mentioned here that the bergamot flavor is too mild; to me, the bergamot flavor is quite prominent, but I don't drink artificially flavored tea, so if you do, this might be a change for you. I love it and would not go back to fake bergamot for anything--real bergamot is a treat and hard to find. Over time, you really don't want anything else and the fake stuff tastes chemically. So if you want to try the real thing, I think you'll love this tea.<br /><br />This tea is certified organic and contains just Organic Assam Black Tea TGFOP Grade 1 (Oxidized Camellia Sinensis) scented with organic Italian Bergamot Fruit (Citrus Bergamia). It is also kosher. On the box, the manufacturer writes: ""Numi's special Earl Grey is oil-free, using a unique method of aging premium Italian bergamot fruit with malty Assam black tea. When brewed, it imparts an exquisite red-orange hue that calls to mind dawn's finest moments. Balanced and stunning, we've recreated this timeless classic.""<br /><br />The price is perfect, a nice savings over single boxes. If you like Earl Grey tea, get it---you won't be sorry.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"
1,"This tea has a smooth, well rounded flavor and goes very well with steamed milk. I drink tea all day, and Earl Grey is my go to black tea. Earl Grey is great black, and a bit of extra dark chocolate on the side is better. Nothing breaks a hot day, or tension like a good tea. This tea has an aroma that pulls. Of the many brands out there this is definitely in my top 5(like #4 or maybe 3), because of the consistency in flavor, good selection, and the company mantra doesn't hurt either. I generally let this tea steep much longer than other brands, because it just doesn't get bitter. My wife got me hook on Earl Grey lattes, and everyone I've offered it to. If you're looking to try something new or a different brand, Numi is well worth a try. And if you've never had the latte it's: a splash of hot water, tea, vanilla syrup (I like just a shot for 16 to 20 oz, but the amount's up to you), and fill with hot milk."
1,"One of the reasons why I love Early Grey tea is the scent of bergamot oil and the strong black tea flavor. This tea, was no Earl Grey. It was more like Assam, with a hint of bergamot oil. If you like Earl Grey, I suggest you try Mariage Fr&egrave;res French Blue Earl Grey or Adagio's Earl Grey. If you like organic, try Mighty Leaf."
1,This is the best earl grey blend we have tasted so far.  Good enough we are on auto ship for it.
0,"The tea is weak, without the slightest hint of bergamot scent or taste.  Even if it were plain black tea, it is of inferior quality. They make a big deal of their organic, wholesome, green image. It's all fancy marketing and packaging. I paid 8.99 for a box of 18 bags at a drugstore. I truly feel gypped."
0,"I am sorry to say I found this tea very weak in flavor.  I was very dissapointed in this tea, in fact I felt they<br />put more work in the packaging than they did the tea."
0,"As you can see, I ordered a set of three boxes of these, happy for free shipping and a good price, which Amazon usually lacks on groceries... and how disappointed I was, not in Amazon but in Numi...<br /><br />I guess too many complained that the SMELL wasn't like other EGs, and they're right... it wasn't. Others spray alcohol-containing, leaf-wrecking oils on the leaves, leaving behind a horrible taste to me and also making the leaves oxidize rapidly, making the tea quality suck! Numi HAD it absolutely perfect. I was ready to tell you how to get, out of their tea, the perfect GENUINE Earl Grey tea, one where the tea wasn't killed by modern techniques of spraying chemicals (essential oils are almost all alcohol, after all; bergamot oil is almost always mixed with cheaper and easier to process citrus that grows far more places than a tiny town in Italy)... and now, I'm just here to say ""move along, nothing here to see"" because in changing their fruit supplier or aging/malting process or -something- (the tea leaves wouldn't likely vary so much, the brews side by side making the same color and the leaves being cut the same way and clearly the same region and process--yes, I'm one of THOSE tea drinkers, Steepster reviews and all), from the bags smelling like another brand, a rather costly one that starts with R and nearly rhymes with fishy, which has rather funky EG (that brand sprays the leaves, which Numi proclaims my shared disdain for)... well, what was--back when they had the boxes with the old man and his walking stick slumped in front of a cottage or whatnot--the first and only EG I would drink happily, a tea I went to specific 24/7 restaurants at 2am when needing food just because I could at least count on the tea... well, it's a passing memory, one I have about half a dozen more memories to treasure before parting ways with Numi, probably with an email expressing sadness.<br /><br />I DO overall recommend their teas: The lemon myrtle chamomile, now deceptively called lemon chamomile when it's the FLOWER not the fruit added to lovely organic chamomile, is hopefully still as wonderful, their Moroccan Mint is unsurpassed and the smoothest, sweetest mint imaginable, impossible to oversteep for that matter, able to handle a trio of steepings for that matter [whereas Stash uses PNW mint that is medicinal, which is honestly only good to make yogurt sauce or ... medicine!], and even for the ones like Golden Chai that aren't to MY liking, they're still well made, just not a blend I care for ingredient-wise...<br /><br />I simply can't recommend THIS Numi product anymore (and I hope as I use the last of my others this proves the ONLY one that got ""revamped"" somehow, the ""how"" seemingly the fruit, whether they are doing it faster or using different fruit or outsourcing the bergamot processing or... whatever they changed to make it a stinky-bagged, fruitless flavored, bitter chemical-aftertaste tea). I tasted the new just one night after a week of delighting in their original blend night after night, using my reliable method with precise timing and all, went away from it a full month, and in finding the last half box of the old, decided to compare them to be sure it wasn't simply me being thrown off. It's not. I don't deem it so unworthy that it can't be a pleasant change for the people who benefit from our brunch outreaches geared at homeless populations, and it'll probably be a welcome addition, but I will NOT be drinking the other 51 bags from this purchase myself, not when I have teas I genuinely love (as I did this, which was barely drinkable with a LOT of sugar that rendered it barely-even-tea anymore--before, it was best with a tiny bit of sugar and milk, but it was absolutely palatable with no additions)."
0,"Although I love Numi teas, the flavor from the tea bags is very weak for aged earl gray. I will keep this first shipment though will look for a brand with more flavor."
1,"This is one of the best Earl Grey teas on sale in the U.S., but all too often supermarkets don't even carry it, and when they do they tend to price it rather high. I placed a recurring order for 3 boxes per month and get it cheaper than I ever would in a store owing to the discount applied for multiple purchases (and no postage costs). The parcel arrives promptly each month and the process is trouble free. I'd recommend it to any tea connoisseur."
1,"Love this tea. We tried other Earl grey teas. So far this is the very best. Love the fact that it is Organic, Fair Trade and more. You got to try it!"
1,These are the small boxes of Juicy Juice. I love the small boxes. Kids can actually finish the box and I don't have to worry about spilled half juice boxes. The kids on my son's t-ball team seem to prefer the orange tangerine flavor. These go much quicker than grape and strawberry kiwi.
1,These are perfect for my little guy. They are the perfect size for him and I love that they are 100% juice.
1,"These are great juice boxes. First: the Orange Tangerine is delicious and generally hard to find in grocery stores. Second: this size is PERFECT for little people. These juice boxes are as small as you are going to find - but that is the point right? The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no more than 4-6oz of juice per day for children, so at 4.23 oz per box - you aren't loading them up with juice. We have these on subscribe and save, so always have them on hand when we are on the run. My kids love them for the flavor, and I love them for their size and 100% juice (no added sugar, additives) - a win for everyone!"
1,"Juicy Juice is always a hit in our family and with my students. Being 100% juice makes it a winner for school snacks and general meal accompaniment. This pack contained the 4 oz size, which is perfect for a quick refresher. Purchased through the Amazon Grocery Subscribe & Save feature, this product was perfectly affordable. When partnered with our Amazon Prime membership for free shipping, it cost less than our local grocer. Simply can't beat having a favorite treat delivered straight to your door for less! And what a fun afternoon...juice by mail! Thank you UPS and Amazon! Very pleased. Looking forward to our next shipment!"
1,"Somebody help me with my math -- either I'm off or Amazon is. I hope Amazon is because it means this juice is an even better bargain for our meetings. Anyway, here's what I get:<br /><br />8 count boxes of 4.23-Ounce ea.  = 33.84 oz.<br /><br />5 Packs of 8 boxes or 5 X 33.84 = 169.2 oz.<br /><br />5 boxes for $11.64 divided by 169.2 oz. = $0.0688 per oz.<br /><br />Amazon shows $0.55 per oz.<br /><br />My calculations showing these little boxes at 29 cents each is a bargain for some really good juice."
1,This is our favorite Matzo.  The Everything tastes like an everything bagel.  We like it year around with butter & salt.  The price on Amazon was far better than our grocery store too.
1,I was very pleased with my latest order of Biscotti.  I will definitely by this product again.  Everything arrived in perfect order.
1,I love these biscottis. They are 15 calories each and taste wonderful. Because there are so few calories these falls under a diet product which means they aren't cheap. However I got them here for about 30% less than the other vendor I used online.
1,"According to the FDA, the reason for the recall was:<br />""The firm decided to recall the wheat flour products they repack that do not declare ""wheat"" on the finished product labels."" ([...])<br />So there is really nothing wrong with the product itself and it should be rather obvious that Gluten Flour should contain wheat unless indicated otherwise...."
1,"Stored in the fridge, this product lasts for years, and remains insect free and ready to add to anything to which you wish to add extra body during the baking process.......this high quality gluten does a great job of trapping the bubbles of carbon dioxide produced by the yeast and your baked goods will rise much higher and be lighter to the taste."
1,The product seems satisfactory. My husband uses gluten in  the making of his whole wheat honey bread.
1,I like the resealable pouch.  It works well crumbled in soup.  I also add crumbles to miso.
1,great when you want something light; can take with you anywhere; lots of fiber; low calorie; perfect part of my diet; taste as good as the strawberry flavor
1,These are convenient for when I need to have something to eat and don't have time.  All I need are in the nutrients.  And my son thinks they are good.  He has been getting into them and drinking as fast as I do.
1,"These smoothies are perfect for just grabbing out of the fridge and going. When I absolutely have to miss a meal or have to cut one short, having one of these keeps me going better than anything else I've tried. It keeps me full while at school or work and the amount of protein makes me feel good about having it as a post-workout shake."
1,Tastes great cold! Just shake it up and pound it after your workout and start recovery. I just ordered 8 cases! Not grainy or clumpy like other products.
1,I love these smoothies and feel that they are satisfying and healthy.  I am looking for other sources since I was buying mine at Costco and now they have discontinued them.  I think they had them in the wrong section.  They are a few dollars less at costco.
1,These shakes are delicious and filling. There are times I need something to hold me over until dinner and these shakes do the trick plus they help me keep my liquid intake up.  I usually drink half first thing in the morning and then another half later in the day.
1,"This is the best protein shake out there, not only is it affordable but it tastes great. This is a great for work when i dont have time to eat lunch this will keep me full for hours. I would recommend this shake to anyone, and i love drinking this after a workout. You will not be disappointed."
1,"I like the product and it does give you energy but the product is not all natural.<br /><br />Ingredients<br />Purified water, whey protein isolate, blackberry juice, buleberry juice, rasberry juice, strawberry juice, papaya juicek, aleo vera leaf juice, fruit and vegetable juice, concentrate, sugar, soluble fiber, pectin, citric acid, natural and artifical flavors, guar gum, sucralose, ascorbic acid.<br /><br />The artifical ingredients in the product are the sucralose, asorbic acid (manufactured in a laboratory Vitamin C) and the artificial flavors.  I see no reason to have these in the product because it does contain a lot of fruit and sugar (8g)which is why I gave the product 4 stars."
1,"Love this smoothie drink;<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004L47IZ6"">Body Choice Orange Smoothie, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a> it keeps me feeling full for hours.  I have now signed-up to have it delivered on a regular basis."
1,Love this product!  Perfect for school lunches for my little guy!  He loves it and the ingredients are wholesome.
1,"I just tried this for lunch. It was pretty good for a gluten free item. If you are used to gluten free (or similar) food you will probably like this. If you not used to gluten free food then I don't know. The flavor was good. I like the size for myself, but if my husband were to eat it he may need 2+ packages for a filling meal. I really like that this product offers a portable, shelf stable food that I can have as a meal if I am on the road and do not have access to safe gluten free food. We have some trips planned for the summer and I plan to take these (and the other flavors) on all of my trips."
1,"nice product, nice product worth every penny and i most definitely needed it for my diet. a purchase that you couldnt get a better price for. excellent product and a recommended buy for those fish eaters"
1,"I initially purchased a few varieties of the Bumble Bee Salad snack kits to take out deer hunting with me.  I was looking for something easy to carry, didn't take up much room, was tasty, and would last for awhile without spoilage.<br /><br />The kit comes with a 3 ounce can of tuna salad, 6 crackers, and a small plastic paddle to spoon the salad on the crackers.  The tuna is in a metal can with a foil lid and the crackers are in a small cellophane (foil looking) pouch.  The little plastic piece is just floating around in there.<br /><br />After being carried and tossed around for a few weeks, I tore open a pack.  The crackers did not hold up too well to the abuse and were mostly a stack of pieces and crumbs.  The cardboard was splitting open allowing dirt to get inside, but at least the little plastic thing was still in there.<br /><br />The taste of the salad was actually quite good.  I did not think it had an overwhelming fishy smell which could be beneficial if you are eating it in close quarters to others who might not like fish.  There is more than enough salad for the crackers which is a nice surprise as most snacks seem to make you ration the spread.<br /><br />If you are on a diet, this meager snack is definitely not worth the 300 calories.  If you are looking for something portable to take on the road, hiking, fishing, hunting, or a snack to send to a soldier in the field, this is a handy, self contained snack.  If the packaging was a bit more durable to protect the crackers, I would say this would be pretty close to the perfect field snack.<br /><br />J. E. Nelson"

1,"Samsclub sell this like $10, much better price, this is great for office use, when you want something quick without need of microwave.  Wish it has napkins, it does has folk, couple piece of craker, the tuna salad itself is delicious, try to eat like 2 of them same time, it has has some fat on it."
1,"Millet flour is great for my gluten free recipes (just remember the xanthan gum). This company takes a little while for shipping and the shipping is a little high, but, the products they sell are cheaper than anywhere else with a greater variety offered."
1,"I was happy to find Avena smoothies available in the US, as it is a delicious, smooth and nutritious drink that blends oats and milk. The Tetra pack with straw makes it perfect at home, for school lunches or on the go. It can be drunk by the glass, in cereal, or as a snack. The long expiration date (about 6 months without refrigeration) is a big plus. It is made in the USA and distributed directly by the manufacturer, Alpina Foods, out of Miami FL.<br /><br />That said, I was surprised at the ingredients: water, sugar, powdrered milk, oat flour, mono & diglycerides, carragenan, guar gum, xhantan gum, salt, sodium tripolyphosphate. In terms of nutrition: 180 calories, 4 grams of fat (3 are saturated), 10 mg cholesterol, 115 mg sodium, 22 gr sugar, 1 gr fiber, 5 gr protein, Calcium 16 DV%. While it tastes similar to real avena, the overly processed ingredients give me pause. I will be looking for a recipe for real avena which is probably not that hard to make and a lot healthier.<br /><br />As a sidenote, you can buy this at your local supermarket (in the section of south american foods) in 8 oz containers for half the price."
1,This is so far my favorite flavor of all of the Ramune flavor I have tried.<br /><br />It has a fun look to it and is great for those who love sweet drinks and don't like or drink caffeine.<br /><br />I being one who avoids caffeine when possible was excited to find a drink I could add to me fridge to give me a change from the few caffeine free drinks I can tolerate.<br /><br />I would recommend these to anyone. If nothing else you have to try at least one in your life time.
1,"I bought the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00142IAKU"">melon flavor</a> for myself and this strawberry for my father.  I was surprised that I really liked the melon, and my father had a great time opening the bottle of his strawberry.  He's the type who HAS to know how things work, so after finishing the drink he went about taking apart the top of the bottle!  Plus, he said that it ""was a pretty good drink"", which is a good compliment from him.<br /><br />We enjoyed the drinks quite a bit, and the bottle made an interesting conversation topic.  I'm sure that kids would love this."
1,"When I got these, I was so excited. They were great, except one thing. Make it cold before drinking. It does not taste good warm."
1,"Before buying this, I was unsure of what it would be. When I tasted it it was very sweet a little too much for my liking. Others may find it appealing, but only $1.99. Go ahead and try it"
1,"Not sweet and syrupy like US sodas. Very refreshing with only 90 calories per 6.76 oz.  Bottle (7% carbs). Zero sodium, fats and cholesterol. The weird glass bottle is a hoot. No plastic bottle aftertaste."
1,"Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin food was a big hit with my dog.  It has a variety of pieces, meat and vegetables, soft and crunchy. It has big chunks that are meant to emulate real pieces of beef. My dog seemed to especially like those. He took each piece out of the bowl and chewed it up in the same manner he would eat a big piece of meat. When I first put some of this food in his bowl, he ate it up in no time and came sniffing around the bag for more. He's a big dog and eats a couple of good sized scoops of dry food each day, so this 4.5 pound bag lasted less than a week. It would last longer for a smaller dog and I'll buy a bigger bag next time I get some.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about this dog food is the bag.  It has to be cut open, which is slightly less convenient than just ripping it or pulling on a string, but not a big deal. I also wish the bag were resealable with a Ziploc-type closure. I have to either transfer this food to another container once opened, or fold it up just so and push the open end against the wall to keep it shut. The bag, however, is not a deciding factor when I'm looking for a food my dog enjoys. I'll certainly consider this dog food in the future."
1,"My dog was and I repeat a WAS a Beneful eater.  However, I decided to try this brand and he loves it.  I have also purchased the chicken dry dog food.  The food is light and he can easily chew it.  There is a difference in price, the Chef Michael's brand is about $4 more than the Beneful bag at my local Shoppers.  But the higher cost is worth it for his enjoyment."
1,"My foster doxies gobbled this food right up. It arrived at the perfect time for one of them; he had been picking at his regular food and generally not feeling well, we found out he was having problems with a tooth and this softer dog food was perfect for him. Now that he's better, he still prefers it. I was happy that the first ingredient was beef, not beef by-product. My only concern is that it has food dyes, Red 40 and more, I know that there are organic vegetable dyes like beet juice that might be better for them. They've eaten half a bag in the last 2 weeks and no adverse effects. Good job Chef Michael."
1,My thirteen year old mixed breed Lady loved this food from the moment we first put it in her bowl.  Typically she does not eat all of her food at one time but grazes through out the day.  She ate this each time it was put out in one single feeding.  For her it was a meal that was a treat.  Will be looking at purchasing other Chef Michael.
1,"I wanted to try this Chef Michael's for a while so when it came I put Chef Michael's in one bowl and Beneful in the other.  Well, pretty much all three would sniff the Beneful then walk over to Chef Michael's and start eating.  The food itself didn't look too much different than regular dog food but the dogs (all three) seem to enjoy it.  They have been pretty quiet as too how much....but they finished the whole bag.  ha ha ha"
1,"Our dog Snowball just ~loves~ Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin, and he will make a point of nosing around in the bowl to eat the ""meaty bits"" first, and then finish off the rest.  He's a fairly picky eater, but this has certainly been one of his favorites.  Our local grocery store isn't carrying this (yet) so this is one purchase for which Amazon Prime shipping will come in quite handy."
1,"Our dog rarely eats her entire bowl of food at one time.  She usually eats a little and returns to it throughout the day.  That all changed as soon as I tried this food.  She quickly consumed the entire bowl when I poured it in.  In addition, she is more eager than ever for her food when I reach for this bag.  This has been surprising to me since I was sure dog food is dog food is dog food.  However, it is clear that this dog food is much preferred by our dog at least."
1,This dog food is palatable according to my dogs.<br />Taking a closer look.<br /><br />Pros :<br />Beef is the first ingredient<br />23 vitamins and minerals<br />100% complete nutrition for adult dogs<br />protein 28%<br />fat 16%<br />fiber 3%<br />water 12%<br />No added artificial preservatives.<br /><br />Cons :<br />Ground Wheat (Wheat Gluten)<br />Added Color _ Red Dye 40<br /><br />I mention these as some of my cats are allergic to Red Dye 40 and some dogs can become allergic as well as to corn and soya.<br /><br />Tender pieces (The Beef Part)with crunchy kibbles (The Died Vegetable Part)<br />Moderately more expensive than the average dry dog food but worth it for a finicky eater. The primary protein is chicken.
1,"I'm really torn on this dog food because I know my dogs really like it but i also know it really isn't filled with the best stuff for the animal. When i put it down my dogs went through the process of devouring it, treating it like a snack and not like food, and that was a good sign. They really liked it. I do try to give them treats now and again and give them at least decent food, but this was well beyond what they were accustomed to. That got me thinking whether this was the best thing for them or not and, reading the bag, I decided it wasn't. The ingredients read like a laundry list of items my vet says to avoid, and I don't think that's the greatest thing to feed them all the time.<br /><br />I guess the best thing to say on this is that it would be a superb addition to the diet of the animal, given that you did not use it as a main item. As a supplement, my dogs would love it and anything they love loves me back. since it did not clump or show any signs of being cheaper food that makes it great too, and the price really isn't bad. This was a trial bag, but i am going out to pick some up and use it when I think the dogs really deserve something they will savor.<br /><br />Thanks."
1,My pug is kind of picky but she really took to the Chef Michael's sirloin dry kibble' I gave it to her mixed with her usual kibble and we had no problem with digestive upset.
1,"I don't really know how to review dog food other than to say my Cocker Spaniel Bonnie is a finicky eater and she just gobbles this up. Sometimes I wish she could talk. However, if she could, I have a feeling she'd be telling me she loved, loved, loved this dog food. Or maybe in the words of a dog food commercial from yesteryear, she'd say it was, ""Doggone good!"""
1,"Judging by the way the dogs eat this food, they love it.  We also put some in a small container and are using the nice size bites as treats."
0,"There are surely some tasty morsels in Chef Michaels Grilled Sirloin Dog Food and there are a few things which my dog wants nothing to do with. My 11 year old dog is pretty set in what she likes and does not like. She is about as discerning as a dog can be. She might have some cat in her as far as her taste buds go because she can be very picky. My dog, LueLue seems to pick some bits out and chow them down pretty fast and leaves alot lying all around her bowl. Then she also does that dog thing where she leave a little trail. I though this would be a good change for her but I can see that we are headed back to Beneful."
1,"Okay, I have a black lab that will eat almost anything...she rejects green peas, banana peels, most fruit and most trash.  I feel that it is important to tell you that, as she aids significantly in this review.  With that said, she does seem to really like this food.  We are pleased and will definitely consider it in the future.  I have no clue what a finicky dog's verdict would be.  This bag is a good size for a trial run though and there isn't a shelter out there that couldn't use the unused portion if you Fido decided it wasn't up to his standards.  Daisy liked it!"
1,"I concur with the majority of the reviews here: my dog seems to quite like this food. It feels a bit moist, looks somewhat colorful, and even smells a bit of beef. In other words, it certainly comes across as good-quality dog food. However, it's worth noting that the ingredients seem to be somewhat of a mixed bag.<br /><br />Beef is the most prevalent ingredient, which indicates a slightly higher quality of product. Look at the labels of many other bags of dog food, and you'll see that the first ingredient is usually some filler -- unfortunately, fillers seem to take up several of the succeeding slots on the ingredients list of this Chef Michael's product. So it's certainly not the highest quality you'll find, but it's definitely not the worst either.<br /><br />Bottom line, my guess is that it seems to be a bit higher quality than your average bag of dog food, and that makes it a bargain for the price. You could do better if you're willing to pay for it, but I think this food will do well for most dog owners."
1,"Our dogs have been eating chicken and rice for quite some time now, but they have no problem when I put some Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin in their bowls. They eat it right up. They seem to look eager when I'm crinkling the bag for the next serving as well."
1,"My dog is really picky about what dry food she'll eat. It was only because I trusted the brand so much that I was willing to give it a try and I am happy I did.<br />Daisy has liked the food since her very first bowl - I didn't have to mix it with her old food and try to sneak it to her - really unusual for her.<br />I like the different sized pieces that are in the bag because the shapes seemed to make her eat more slowly, they probably cleaned her teeth good, and she seemed to get full on less food than what I was giving her before.<br />So far we have only tried 1 bag and part of a second but there have been no health issues and my trust in the Purina brand has paid off."
1,"Since I feed my dogs Science Diet (recommended by my vet), I've been giving this to them as 1/4 of their regular meal.<br /><br />Honestly, they really do enjoy the taste and often times will finish this food before their regular food. Using it as a snack or 1/4 of their meal, they have not had any stomach upset.<br /><br />There are dry kibble bits along with a more moist kibble.The more moist parts are flakes which seem elastic and rubbery.<br /><br />It has a savory scent which just calls them to the dinner bowl. You can separate the moister bits and keep them as reward or treats, another tip given by my vet."
0,"My dogs loved this food. I wasn't surprised that the younger liked it. Her name should be Kirby.  Our older dog is a bit more picky, but seemed to really enjoy the food.<br /><br />As a pet owner, I'm not very fond of it. I think it's a bit pricy, especially for the amount. Also, I don't think it's good for them, too much soy, corn and added colors. I read somewhere that dogs really can't see colors so why was it necessary to add colors, especially since some dogs don't react well to color dyes.<br /><br />Even though my dogs enjoyed it, I won't be switching from our regular brand."
1,"I try to feed Maggie quality food because she is a valuable member of my family.  This food was great, I loved the mea tand vegeatble chunks and so did she.  She was getting to the point that she wouoldn't eat Iams or Science Diet and now I can mix this in with it and she eats it.  The only complaint I have is that noe of the local stores carry it."
0,"I am not going to get into the nutritional side of this product because Brenda has done an outstanding job of covering that. The woman knows her dog food! I am simply going to tell you our dogs opinion of the taste quality:<br /><br />Beckham is a two year old whippet who is more pup than dog. He typically eats Purina One for meals, meaty bones and pigs ears for snacks and a denta-bites for his teeth. His breeder (who I am sure was glad to see the backside of Beckham) recommended the above, well, okay not the pigs ears but that is just so deliciously disgusting to impose on the kids. Beckham has also been known to eat grass, slugs, deer poo and other revolting items. What Beckham will not eat is Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin. Said Sirloin has been hand fed to Beckham, hidden in with his standard kibble and offered as a treat for not pulling on walks. Nope, nope, nope, Beckham is not having it. Chef Michael please report back  to the kitchen.<br /><br />Not recommended by Beckham. (Or Brenda)"
1,"I help care for pets when their owners leave town. As I never know when I will be expected to take in a furry visitor I like to keep a bag of kibble on hand. I picked up a bag of Chef Michael's for a couple of reasons:<br /><br />1.) Nutritionally it has a good generic base for any Dog: 28% crude protein (beef), 16% crude fat (min), 3% Crude fiber (max) and toutes 23 essential vitamins and minerals. (like the dog notices.) It's a good mix of both tender & crunchy bits.<br /><br />2.) I admit I picked it up on sale and the shelf-life is for well past a year.<br /><br />However, my wards have yet to turn their nose up at it and it goes down well."
1,It's a little hard to write a review on a product that you don't actually use yourself.  I thought I would get this and give it a try as my dog has been off his food for a little while now. I've tried various different dogfoods to see which one he liked to no avail.<br />The first thing you notice when you open the pack is the amount and quality of the steak in the food.  I gave a bowl to my dog and he went through the whole bowl in about 10 minutes and was begging for more.  Finally a product that he'll eat and one that won't break my bank either.
0,"Some of the other reviewers have gone into great detail about the nutritional content of this, as well as the price difference.  Not only is there no need for me to repeat it all, I don't think I could do it justice as they had.<br /><br />What I can do is agree with them - the dogs really like this.  But the dogs don't know what's good for them, and they don't know when to stop.  Our dogs have been on rationed food in order to keep them trim and fit.  One of them, a labradoodle, scarfs up the food so fast that she has to have her small portions doled out to her in smaller portions.  And even then it seems half of it must go into her lungs since she's inhaling, not eating.  This made it even worse.<br /><br />As others have said, it's like candy for dogs compared to the other foods out there.  And while the dogs seem to really love it, the owners have to be the ones in control, and use common sense.  For a regular diet, I just don't see the content this offers as matching up to some of the better designed foods out there for pets.  Let's face it - in the multi-billion dollar pet industry, there's MORE than enough choice out there to find what's the best content and at a reasonable price.  I just don't think this is the answer for our dogs."
1,"My elderly (16 y.o.!) chow-shepard-lab mix loooooooves this food.  She will eat hers at blinding speed, then horn in on our other dog's bowl - and she never violates the ""food bowl territory"" of the other dog.  Considering the older dog was losing her appetite and losing weight (along with eyesight and hearing, sigh!) we are overjoyed that we've found a food she's willing to dig into. For this reason alone, I would give the product 5 stars, as I think her interest in the food may help her live a bit longer (i.e., she's putting on weight, which is a good sign - she used to weigh 48lbs, and had dropped to 37!).  That said, our chow-beagle mix, who is 7 y.o., absolutely hates the food.  I pour it into her bowl and she looks at me forlornly, sighs, then walks off into the yard in protest. I'm not sure she eats it at all (I think our older dog is eating both), which is why I'm also giving the younger dog other dog food/biscuits as a supplement.  Based upon my gratitude to Purina for creating a dog food my elderly dog loves, I'm giving the food 4.5 stars.  It would have been 5 if only I could get our other dog to eat it, too!"
1,"I so wanted to post a video of our dog eating Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food, but my camera software would not cooperate.  I will therefore provide you a written testimony.  Shep, our rescued English Setter, has always been very finicky about his food.  Many times he walks away rather than eat something he does not care for.  Upon seeing Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food in his bowl he took the time to fully investigate by sniffing and lightly tasting with his tongue and then drooling (Shep has a tendency to do that when he really likes something).  Then, he started eating and he ate and he ate, until it was all gone.  Then, like one of the three bears he examed his empty bowl numerous times in the hopes that more would appear.  He repeated this ritual with every meal until the bag was gone.  We're on our way to the store now to refill his pleasure palate.  I can highly recommend this dog food."
1,"I know that most dog foods are designed to appear appetizing to the dog's owner.  This one certainly appears that way.  The smell is pleasing, and it actually looks like a meal.  Ok, not a meal that I would eat, but it looks like a meal rather than kibble.  With that said, my dogs went wild for this stuff.  I have a collie and a pointer/lab.  The pointer is the more aggressive when it comes to eating, and the collie, while older and larger, usually waits his turn at the bowl.  The moment I poured this bag into the bowl, the collie took over and the pointer was relegated to grabbing a mouthful and absconding to the other room to enjoy it.<br /><br />Needless to say, it costs a lot more than dog chow, and at this price they won't be getting it often, but this sure was a nice treat for the dogs!"
1,"For a dry dog food this has dog appeal.<br />The test dog is off dry in these hot summer days,<br />but she dug right in to a big serving<br />and it was gone in a few moments.<br />That reaction puts this dog food high<br />on the customer satisfaction scale."
1,"Our dog grew up on Purina products and trust the name, so we were eager to try this food out on him. When I removed the bag from the box, our dog was eagerly sniffing it and seemed to be excited about the contents. When it was opened, he began to act like he does when we get his dog treats out, hopping around and begging for it. He couldn't wait for it to be poured in his dish and gobbled it right down. Unlike his normal Dog Chow that is left to eat when he is hungry, this has to be rationed or I really don't think he'd stop until it was gone. Instead we sprinkle it over top of his regular food and dole it out like a treat. He has no problems digesting Chef Michael's unlike the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006345MA"">Purina Beneful Original, 7-Pounds</a> we tested on him a while ago.<br /><br />From our dog's point of view this food was ""totally awesome""!"
1,"I gave this food to my parent's dogs (country dogs that run around outside all day - a Blackmouth Cur and a Pitbull/Heeler mix). Both of them absolutely loved it and ate it a lot faster than they normally eat their food (especially the Cur). In fact, she had to eat hers a lot faster or the Pit would have been moving in on her bowl. Usually these two dogs eat their food next to each other, maybe a little bit of snapping or trying to eat each other's food but not too much. They were crazy for this stuff and more excited than usual to eat the next day. That's a really good thing if you have a dog that is finicky but maybe not so good if you have more than one dog and one of them might want to try stealing the other's food. I don't think this is the healthiest food choice but it's definitely something that dogs enjoy and is a perfect treat (or something to mix in with other foods to get them to eat it)."
0,"The dogs like it, as the other reviewers have said, but it doesn't seem to be a very good food for them. I wouldn't have gotten it if it hadn't been provided freely for review through the Vine program. The advertising sounds good but...<br /><br />Here are the GA numbers:<br /><br />Crude Protein (min.) 28.0%<br />Crude Fat (min.) 16.0%<br />Crude Fiber (max.) 3.0%<br />Moisture (max.) 12.0%<br />Linoleic Acid (min.) 1.2%<br />Calcium (Ca) (min) 1.0%<br />Phosphorus (P) (min.) 0.8%<br />Vitamin A (min.) 14,000 IU/kg<br />Vitamin E (min.) 150 IU/kg<br /><br />Those are actually decent if not great GA figures. I think, though, that this food is a pretty good example of how to finesse GA numbers. Everything after 'beef' is mostly hard too digest filler material. Soy [except for soy hulls] is a rapidly fermenting fiber which means it doesn't do a very good job of absorbing water while being digested so the doggie may experience a laxative effect and end up with diarrhea. Yuk. My two dogs haven't seemed to have had that problem but I mixed this 4.5lb bag with about 3 pounds of very high quality food (small/regular breed version): <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007794PBM"">Blue Buffalo Large Breed Wilderness Chicken Adult Dry Dog Food, 24 lbs.</a><br /><br />It contains 'poultry by-product meat' which means the carcas minus the feathers. So, head, feet, gristle, etc. 'Animal digest' - google it for an eye opening description at wiki and then the other side of the story from Purina. Although Purina gives a pretty nice sounding description and I'm sure that the nutritional information is accurate, they actually confirm what wiki reports by way of ommission if nothing else. Purina can't be ignorant of what detractors say about this ingredient.<br /><br />The big chunks that are red to represent beef are soft. So if you use dry food because you avoid soft food for your dogs you won't care for this even if it is otherwise not a problem for your situation.<br /><br />I recommend looking for something else. The Blue Buffalo I linked is excellent but expensive."
1,"I got this as a special present for a good friend and neighbor's Jack Russell and it did score big with both dog & owner.  Some reviewers attack it on nutritional grounds, but hey, I doubt it hurts giving this to a loved dog as a special treat from time to time."
1,"Usually I mix my labs' dry dog food with wet in order for them to eat it. When I served them the Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food, they licked their bowls clean. They didn't wait for me to add the wet food. The food has a colorful mixture of dry food with what looked like chunks of meat. My dogs and I highly recommend this brand!"
1,"Well, what can you say about dog food in a product review? My dog loved it... 'nuff said. It has a nice ""meaty"" look to it and, were I a k9, I believe I would enjoy the food as well :)"
1,"My dog eats anything and I mean literally, anything...oranges, grapes, spinach, watermelon...but not french fries or any form of potato (weird, I know!).<br />So, I wasn't surprised that he loved this.<br />We by Annamaet dog food so, of course, we are particular about what we feed our dog.<br />I decided to mix this in with his regular food as an extra bonus/treat and he absolutely loved it.<br />I didn't notice any sort of smell that others complain about and believe me, I am quite sensitive to smells.<br />No complaints here."
1,"The ingredients list on this is decent...first ingredient listed is beef.  There are still a lot of fillers (grains and meals) and several vitamins with 28% crude protein.  My test doggie liked it...didn't love it.  She wasn't sure at first about some of the pieces...set them aside and ate them later (she's not a picky eater).<br /><br />I prefer the Cal Ranch high protein dog food for an active dog (44% protein).  It costs way less too.  For dogs who do fine on most anything I'll just stick with Dog Chow...I can't see a difference with ""higher quality"" dog foods for most of my dogs.  Only the sled dogs/very active dogs and dogs with trouble keeping weight on seem to do better with higher protein foods.  Less active dogs just get fat on them.  I do supplement with a good amount of raw meat and fresh fruits/vegetables.  Something like this may be good for dogs who don't get good supplements to dry food."
1,"We've been trying out some cheaper options for dog food - the overly granola-y stuff from the upscale dog store was getting too expensive. I want something with a primary ingredient of meat, since, well, he's a dog, so I figured this would be a good option.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Soft, meaty bits, along with some bits that are crunchy to add variety.<br />- Dog piles into this one. He's a 3 year old Brittany and loves this food. Much better than the Costco stuff we tried before.<br />- The ingredients list doesn't read like a confusing blast of petrochemicals.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- None, really. The bag's a bit small, I guess."
0,"Of course she liked the taste - it's basically junk food for dogs.  I just can't get past the ingredients.  I won't be feeding this to my dog.  It's a cheap, low-quality food and I love my dog and want to give her better.  If you want to feed your dog a quality food, find something else."
1,"Clean plate<br /><br />Our dog is a medium size mixed breed that normally eats part of her food and then comes back later. We feed her 1 cup in the morning and 1 in the evening. Normally when we have switched foods there are some digestive upsets, but that did not happen with this brand.<br /><br />More than that she sat and ate it all when she was served. The dog food we normally give her has beef as its first ingredient and so does this. The only problem is that this is more pricy and the bag has no closure, so especially for a food she will search out, it has to be put in a metal container, which we normally do, but the bag does not stay closed. We had to resort to taping it shut twice a day - it would be nice, especially for the price if there was a zipper like closure."
0,"I cannot recommend this dog food.<br /><br />Why?  because it contains poultry by-product meal.  I never give my dogs any dog food that contain by-products.  By-products are essentially the left over beaks, tails, etc. from animals that companies don't know what to do with, so they grind them up and call them dog food.  In addition, this contains ground wheat, and I've learned from past experience that wheat contributes to arthritic symptoms in some dogs.  I also don't like the ""grilled steak flavor"" which is obviously artificial flavoring and has nothing to do with meat.  That's how they can get away with saying this dog food has ""grilled sirloin steak flavor.""<br /><br />I am sorry to give a poor review.  I hate giving bad reviews.  But some of the ingredients in this dog food are just sub-par.  Sorry Nestle' Purina - I know for a fact that you make other quality products, but this isn't one of them."
0,"This dogfood is like candy to the dogs, they love it, but it is not necessarily safe or healthy.  The soy protien in this food gives them horrible gas. It's not just irritating for the owner, (I mean I have my dog on my lap all the time) but serious can be detrimental to your dogs health gas.  Yes, they will gobble it up and beg for more, but I decided it was not good for my two small dogs.  As many other reviewers have already renumerated in more detail the reasons why this is just not good, I won't say more.  But I am very picky about what I give my dogs.  They are part of my family, and if there is a hint of doubt I won't give it to them.  The gas thing cannot be good.  Purina is a reputable company, so use your own judgement, this is just my opinion."
1,"I have two dogs, a German Shepherd and a Beagle.  They absoluey love this Grilled Sirloin. In order for them to chew it without devouring and not swallowing it, I mix it with their regular dry food. Calms them down a bit. It's not crunchy, it's softer dry food. Very moist. They had no adverse reactions to it either; no diarrhea etc."
1,"When I recently tested <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ0B0I"">PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food</a> on my dogs for another review, they dug around for the chewy/meaty pieces, and acted like savages with their dog feeder; I thought they would do the same thing with this dog food, but it was the green veggie-pieces that they dug out of the dog dish. Eventually they ate all of the pieces, but I was happy to see them take to the veggie ingredients over the meaty pieces.<br /><br />The change in their diet didn't seem to have negative affects to their overall health or their potty habits; if anything, they seemed to have more energy than usual, although they are naturally bouncy dogs.<br /><br />I would consider giving them this food again, if I could get them to stop digging for the green pieces first."
1,"Amber, our Golden Retriever, ate this food right up.  She gave it 5 stars and said it was delicious.  We noticed that the food is ""puffed up.""  That's neither good or bad, just an observation.  I suppose if you have limited storage space, it would be an issue.  The food we normally give her is definitely more compact, and less airy."
1,"When I receive new products for Muffin I always worry she won't like them, she is a pretty picky eater. Well, from the first bite she has loved this food. She is a smaller dog (Peek-A-Poo) but she has no problem chewing on the larger chunks. I mixed it with her old brand of food so the change would not be too drastic. She was so funny because she picked out all the new stuff and left the old in the dish. I guess that she has made her choice, I will be purchasing this from now on. I am also pretty impressed with the price, it is comparable to what she currently eats, and as always, Amazon offers the free shipping."
1,"Dixie, our golden retriever, who's usually a picky eater, gobbles up the Purina Chef Michael's Dog Food"" in seconds. She seems to love the smell, taste and texture of the grilled sirloin steak flavors and potato and green bean garnishes.<br />The 4.5 pound Chef Michael's package label says it ensures the adult dog food has 100% complete and balanced nutrition. The ingredients is real beef as the protein and vegetables as garnishes. The tender beef pieces and crunchy kibbles include twenty-three essential vitamins and minerals and no artificial preservatives.<br />Dixie and I wholeheartedly recommend the Chef Michael's dog food for a well-rounded, tasty meal with premier ingredients."
0,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:52 Mins<br /><br /></span>This food was well recieved by my dog. However, on closer inspection...<br />Beef is the main ingredient. However, soy, wheat, and corn are in there, bumping out the amount of meat by quite a bit. Dried beans and potatoes are nice, but why the artificial color? The shame of it is, there are some really fine and healthy ingredients, but to make the cost something most folks are willing to pay, there are corners cut. As an occasional mix-in, this might be ok, but honestly, after reading the label, I wish they used better ingredients and charged a bit more. I certainly would not feed this on a regular basis."
1,"Very pleased with the quality and ingredients listed. The two dogs really love this. It's nice to have found a food that they are happy with. Quality food, good price. They're happy--we're happy. Would definitely recommend giving it a try."
1,"We have a Saint and two Chihuahuas and all three love the taste of this stuff. At the moment while breaking them in on this while keeping with their regular diet, we have been giving it to them as a treat. They love it. I am not sure you can give dog food a better review than that."
1,"My dog gives this 2 big paws up.  Now, to be fair, he likes almost any food, but I think I detected, if possible, an even greater enthusiasm than normal for this one.  When he had gobbled it up, he sniffed all over to see if possibly there might have been a crumb dropped anywhere, and then came to me to see if perhaps I felt like giving him an extra helping.  And, not that it matters, but this food does look fancier than the normal dog food I feed him, with some of the kibbles resembling hunks of meat.  I was also impressed that the first ingredient was beef, although there was also lots of other stuff that was nowhere near natural.  I would also say that the softness of the beef-look kibbles is probably not great for his teeth, but maybe that's not a problem for you if you brush your dog's teeth.  But definitely for taste, attractive look, and beef content, I give this a high rating."
1,"I don't own a dog, but I do have friends who do. They own a small, fluffy white dog of a nonspecific variety named Momo. He was a stray, so they don't know how old he is, but he's clearly getting up there in years. I know they want to take good car of him, so when the chance came up to snag them a quality dog food, I did so. They fed him some of the food the other day.<br /><br />According to my friends, Momo initially turned up his nose at the food, and walked away. About twenty minutes later, he came back and started chowing down. He ate, according to them, far more than he usually does. They also commented that they personally liked the fact that it ""looked like"" real food.<br /><br />So there you go. Momo the dog likes the food, and his owners are pleased by it, too."
1,"I perfectly understand that the marketing of pet products is directed to the pet owner.  I have never actually had a pet demand a certain brand of pet food-- I do have cats who refuse to eat pate style cat food, which I think may be my own fault for giving in to them and buying the sliced bits in gravy when they turned their little kitty noses up at the pate.<br /><br />But anyway, the dogs definitely had a way of eating this dog food. The bits that represented steak went first.  The last bit was the green things-- which is kind of amusing because I once had a dog who absolutely refused to eat the green round things in Beneful.  She would delicately pick out all of the green things and leave them scattered around her bowl.  So when I found the green things from this brand scattered around I wondered if Lucy's ghost had shown up to protest.  Shortly after that I noticed that one of the dogs had finally eaten them.<br /><br />No one developed any stomach problems or itchies after eating it so it has a thumbs up from a human and pricked ears from three dogs."
1,"This dog food ( dry kibble) is. So popular with our dogs!  and it is practically<br />odorless, so we can keep a bowl in our bedroom for nighttime snacking, which keep our dogs quite all night."
0,"Dogs liked it ""okay.""  Did NOT give it th the dogs on restricted diets (I have a Scottie and a Golden that have allergies). And the price point is high for the grade of food that this is.  At this price point, you can get a food with less wheat and soy.  And, one that dogs LIKE better.  Dislike.  (O, and this has red dye.)<br /><br />I recommend [...] for finding a quality food (and the best quality fr your price range)."
1,"I had both of my golden retrievers try the Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food to see if they would like it.  The 8 month old overgrown puppy will eat almost anything and he loved this dog food, which I expected him to do.  I wasn't so sure about the 9 year old ""picky"" eater, but she really liked this food, as well!  She will eat her regular dry kibble, but not until she is really hungry, and she will often skip one of her twice daily feedings after checking to see what is in her food bowl.  The morning she found Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin in her dish, she sniffed it, looked at me (I'm pretty sure she smiled) and proceeded to gobble up the food.  Of course her ""brother"" had already inhaled his and was hoping for more!<br />  This dry food is not shaped like regular kibble, in that every piece does not look or feel the same.  The best way I can describe it is to say that it looks like ""dehydrated"" beef stew.  The pieces of meat are irregularly shaped and flatter than most kibble, and the veggies (mainly peas and carrots) really look like vegetables.  I would describe the texture as thick, solid ""flakes"" rather than round or square pieces of kibble.  I detected no odor, although it must smell wonderful to the dogs.<br />  I have not used the Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin for the dog's regular feedings as one dog is still eating puppy food and the other eats senior formula, so I can't really comment on the nutrition value, or how this food affects their canine digestive tracts.  What I can comment upon, is how much both dogs loved this food.  I've been using a handful at a time as ""training rewards"" and both dogs like the Chef Michael's food as much as their regular treats.  We can keep the dogs' regular bags of food on a closet floor to which the dogs have full access, but I've had to hide the Chef Michael's food, since I found a large golden head in the bag!  A 4.5 bag is not going to last very long at our house.<br />  I plan to discuss the Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Food with my vet before feeding it to the dogs on a regular basis, but if she oks it, I will definitely purchase this dry food and add another star to my rating.  (Hopefully, it is also sold in a 20lb or 40lb size).  Until then, I'll use it as treats for the dogs, or for ""dessert"" on top of their present food.  If my ""picky dog,"" who often refuses regular dog treats, eats Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food, it's obviously yummy!"
1,"I have a finicky Border collie/Golden Retriever cross, and he's been tired of Science Diet, so I tried out Chef Michael's.<br /><br />He likes it a *lot*.  So, rank that as a plus.  He seems to like this brand more than any other dog food brand.<br /><br />On the minus side, he's smelling a bit weird now, on occasion.  He's usually odor free 24/7, so that's a change for him.  I'll see if that phases passes, and if it does, I'll stick with Chef Michael's.  Obviously, that's what my dog would like, but I can be finicky, too.<br /><br />Recommended."
1,"It really looked like a bowl of stew.  My dogs seemed to scarf it down, which was a relief.  My wowser, jack, only ever seems to eat blue without me having to dress his food up with grated meat or cheese.  Pepper will eat anything so it didn't surprise me that she enjoyed this just as much as blue or nature's choice."
1,"This food smells good, compared to a lot of dog foods, has beef, soy, potatoes & corn in it, but ell liked. My cat likes the little pieces (I'll have to do something about that to be sure it'k OK that she's eating to fog food, or put it up or something?)<br /><br />Not at all ""kibble"". Looks like shredded jerky with smaller little bits in green & tan (I'm guessing soy & corn or soy & potato?)<br /><br />Well liked & disappears quickly! (practically inhaled!)<br /><br />The dog loves it & the cat even likes the smaller crunchy bits. Smells better than most pet food I've tried!<br /><br />If your dog likes beef, they'll love this! I was even tempted to try a bit it looked really good! Has added vitamin E & others for coat & intestinal tract. I'm not a vet, & don't know a lot about dog digestion, but this is a FAR cry from those round balls of who knows what. Looks & smells like real beef jerky (might even be?)<br /><br />Very well tolerated (both the dog & the cat like it!) Seems it would be easily digestible, as long as your dog digests beef OK.<br /><br />Does contain soy, and I'm guessing quite a bit, which is why I gave this 4 stars as soy that isn't fermented (along with most nuts) contains enzyme inhibitors which can be deactivated by soaking (such as with soaking almonds that BTW taste a LOT better that way!) or fermenting, which I doubt s done in the dog food, so I would investigate that further, as soy beans & nuts (at least in humans & from reading, apparently in dogs too) can reduce thyroid function, which is OK if your dog has an over-active thyroid, or Graves' disease, yet I'd look into how it is processed. I'm sure this action, if also true in dogs, like in humans can vary from individual to individual & it seems certain breeds are more susceptible to hypothyroidism than others. I've been told that some large breeds can benefit from soy, as they can be prone to hyperthyroidism. Stress also plays a factor in this in humans & I imagine dogs as well, so if you are looking for the the ""best food"" for your dog, you might want to get an intracellular nutritional panel (blood test by your vet) done & look at food analysis of different foods to find what is best for your dog.<br /><br />The soy may not be the best for all dogs, yet in others it may be essential to help your dog balance an overactive thyroid & if your dog's family has a history of hypothyroidism, it probably isn't the best. Best to consult your vet for your dog's needs, but I can say it gets gobbled up!"
1,"It's a challenge to review a dog food, because I'm not about the try it myself. However, my dog at the up quickly. He loves it over his old food.<br /><br />I almost *want* to try it because of the ""natural filet mignon flavor"". That's right up my alley."
1,"My dogs really like this food.  It is a great reward during training.  It's hard to find a good variety of nutritionally balanced training treats, so I was happy to find this.  The yellow and green kibbles are of a typical kibble texture and a nice size for a treat for a dog up to about 50 pounds.  The softer, squishy ""meaty"" looking pieces are of variable size.  Most are larger than the hard kibbles.  Some are quite small -- there will be a very small portion of the bag that ends up as topping for a meal.  Nutritionally and economically, it is not as good as the Eukanubia I use as my dogs' main diet.  So I do recommend this for use as a training treat!"
1,"The best feature about this dog food is that dogs (I have four) find it especially palatable. When it arrived, they sniffed the unopened package and would not leave its side. When it was finally offered to them (as a test for this review, of course), they were quite excited and gave it thumbs up. Note there is a package warning to mix it with old food over a number of days for an adjustment period).<br /><br />What's to like: The pieces are semi-soft and come in various shapes so they are closer to dogs' natural food in the wild. The drawback is that the semi-soft pieces will not contribute to teeth cleaning as does hard. But the dogs certainly find it more appealing and it makes their mealtime more enjoyable.<br /><br />(As I write this review, the dogs have gather round my computer as I placed the bag on the desk for referral purposes. Hope I can get through writing this piece without too much commmotion and distraction!)<br /><br />Some of the ingredients are nice: especially the vegetables (potato and green beans); there are a variety of vitamin supplements and the food definitely has a grilled sirloin steak odor. The beef is real along with grilled sirloin steak flavor.<br /><br />What is not particularly appealing is the poultry by-product meal (there is some nasty stuff in poulty by-products; four food dyes (they are labelled ""colors"") make the food look pretty but I would prefer the by-products and food dyes were eliminated. They seem to only serve a commercial purpose.<br /><br />Because of the semi-softness of the food, it can be served to all sizes of dogs (mine range from a chow chow to a bichon-poo). I would say if there is any problem with dogs not finding food offerings very appetizing, try  this food. In that department it's a winner."
0,"Clearly this new Purina line of pet food cleverly capitalizes on recent human food trends such as chef-made dinners.  The stylized food-porn photography on the packaging all target the pet owner that wants to feed the pet version of their own heat-and-eat chef-prepared meals.<br /><br />The advert:<br />Purina's Chef Michael's TV adverts suggest that ""Chef Michael"" is celebrity chef Michael Chiarello. However, non of the shots actually show the face of the man in the commercial although he is of similar height, build and complexion as chef Chiarello and is dressed in clothes of a style and color that Chiarello usually wears on his shows.  After some internet research, and an email to Purina, it can be concluded that chef Chiarello has nothing to do with this food. Wow! Just wow! How tricky of Purina to make a fake chef that is almost like a real celebrity chef and market their product with it.<br /><br />The Food<br />Pros:<br />+ My dog was immediately attracted to the bag when it was delivered.<br />+ My dog was really into this kibble and I managed to use it as treats for training.<br />+ It looks really nice to humans, with coloured bits making it look like it was some sort of dried pet gourmet-stew.<br />+ The first ingredient on the list is beef.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Questionable ingredient quality.<br />- The second ingredient on the list is soybean meal and the third and fourth are soy flour and animal fat.  The soybean meal and soy flour are fillers that also increase the chemical protein measurement of the food.  The fourth ingredient of animal fat from unspecified sources increases the platablity of the food to pets.<br />- Other questionable ingredients include corn gluten meal and ground yellow corn which is again a filler and is also not easily digested by dogs.<br />- Food coloring is also present in this food to make it looks appealing to us so we feel better about feeding this food to our pets.<br />- Mendaione (chemical vitamin K) is also added to the food; studies are currently being done on this chemical form of vitamin K and latest results suggest that it may be linked to liver toxicity, allergies and red blood cell abnormalities.<br /><br />My dog (after 2 weeks on this food):<br />+ My picky dog is inexplicably attracted to this food.<br />+ I can use this kibble as training treats.<br />- This food makes her have gas.<br />- This food makes her have several large greasy poops a day.<br />- My dog has been gagging in the morning and has thrown up undigested food a few times over the past 2 weeks. She seems to be intolerant of this food.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />If this food works for your dog and your wallet, then this is s good food for your dog.  My dog seems to be be intolerant of this food although she really wants to eat it.  As I'm not looking at this food too highly mainly because of its lack of high quality ingredients and the semi-misleading adverts, I'm not too upset at this fact.  I'll be moving her back to her old food and donating the rest of this bag to the local shelter."
0,"I was really surprised that our dog actually seemed to like this.  Usually, he is extremely picky about his food, and he normally does not like anything not chicken.  However, he seemed to enjoy this.  I thought that was great, until I checked out the ingredients.  While beef is listed first, which is important, the two next listed are soy and soy by products.  While they do have value as proteins, the value is no where near that of real meat, and the price per ounce is higher than what I pay for a dog food with lots more real protein value.  When it comes to dog food, all protein is not created equal.  If your dog is larger or a working breed, this food really will not give him the best protein bang for your money.  Most of the other ingredients are filler and empty calories. I think the coloring is a real poor choice.  The artificial chemicals used in coloring dog food are really just added to make the human consumer feel that the food is better balanced and has more variety, the color has no positive impact on the health of the dog.  I prefer to stick with more natural and healthy ingredients.  Not to mention that with the higher price per ounce, it is less filling and the dog will want to eat even more of it to fill the need for real protein.  While it may taste good to him, I would rather give him healthier food that is a better deal money wise and health wise.  I will let him eat it, since he does seem to enjoy it, but I am thinking of it more as a treat type item, and definitely not a regular part of his diet."
0,"Our 13 year old Golden lab wants nothing to do with this food.  He smells it, took a bite then started barking at his bowl.  He finally quit when I took the bowl away and gave him Kibbles n' bits (his favorite).  I donated the bag to a local shelter, hopefully they can use it."
1,"One of my dogs is a picky eater.  You wouldn't think this would happen, but it does.<br /><br />Well, she appeared to enjoy this food quite a bit.  Maybe it helps that it has a variety of textures and looks like real food (as opposed to pelleted kibble).  Maybe it's the smell, which seems more like actual meat and vegetables.  Hard to say.<br /><br />The good news is that she cleaned her bowl (for a change) and wagged her tail the whole time she was eating.  I would recommend that anyone whose dog does not require special diet (our other dog does) give this food a shot."
1,"The nuggets do have a ""real food"" look to them, though it was hard to tell if they were actually dried vegetables or flavored nuggets.<br /><br />A softer dry food, it had a bit more aroma than other brands.<br /><br />My dogs were excited about it when added to their regular dog food for a few days.<br /><br />Though, after time, I think they realized it was dog food and would hold out a bit for the little touches of people food I normally give them.<br /><br />The ingredients look decent for dog food.  A good choice if buying higher end supermarket dog food."
1,"I like that this dog food has beef chunks and vegetables in it. I know some people are upset about the soy, but I don't see it as an issue with my chihuahua ""Tequila"". Tequila is very picky about his dog food and does not eat hard brown dog food for some reason. With this dog food being multi-colored and having beef pieces I was hoping he would eat all of it.<br /><br />Tequila perked up the second I opened the bag. You could tell that he loved the smell. I gave him one of the beef chunks and he immediately devoured it. I filled his bowl with the food and he excitedly ran over to it and started eating. When I walked into the kitchen later, there were hard brown chunks of food placed everywhere throughout the room. Dang dog! He did eat everything else in the bowl. So, he likes it better than a lot of other dog foods. As far as I know, there is not a dog food on the market that he will eat all of....so it gets four paws up from him. I would buy this food for my pup again."
0,"I really tried to get my dog to eat some of the food from the bag that I was sent to review. I offered it to her several times. I even resorted to trying to wrap it in bits of ham the way that we administer pills to her. She is very picky and sometimes once you can get her to at least taste something she comes around and decide she likes it.<br /><br />In this case, it didn't work out. She ate the ham and spat out the dog food. After repeating this on several different occasions I took the hint and quit trying to get her to eat the food. For whatever reason, she's just not going for this one. It's not the healthiest of dog foods, anyway, so I'm not planning to give it another shot or try another flavor any time soon."
1,"The Chef Michael's dog food by Purina is great. Usually my dog ""Champ"" takes a few minutes to decide if he likes a new food or not, but he dove right in and ate this food so quickly it was almost comical. I didn't have to mix this food with this because it was already very appetizing to him. There has been no problems so far with his digestive system and his coat is still shiny so I think that its doing him good and I'll use this as more of a treat than as a meal so that when he behaves, I'll reward him with this. Good job Purina my Champ loves this dog food!!"
1,This dry dog food smells as good as any you might buy your canine.  Our 20 pound mixed breed likes it as well as anything she has tried.  No complaints.
1,"Sometimes, as people, we want to have special meals with food we love. Perhaps it is a place that has a special steak, or perhaps our wife or our mother makes a special family dish that we savor.<br /><br />For those of us that love our pets, we sometimes want to offer our pets the same kind of treat. If this is you, Chef Michael has just the right food for your doggy's fancy. Made with good meat, what the company describes of ""garnishes"" of potatoes and green beans, and ""prepared with care"", this dog food attempts to spoil your puppy with dog food that promises healthy, yummy goodness.<br /><br />Our dog enjoys this food. We can't afford to serve it to him everyday, but we will pull it out once in a while."
1,"There are three dogs in our house: I-Don't-Eat-Dry-Food, I'll-Eat-Any-Kind-of-Food, and I'll-Eat-AnyTHING. We fed all three Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food at the same time but separately so we would know who ate what. Rocky (the dog that eats everyTHING)attacked his bowl with gusto and was begging for more. Mr. Peabody (the dog that eats anything edible) wolfed down his portion. The big surprise was that Charity, who will NOT eat anything but two flavors of Mighty Dog, went after this food like either a) she hadn't eaten in six months, or b)it's her most favorite food in the world. She gets fed twice a day, so it couldn't have been ""a.""<br /><br />Rocky's begging for more was also a surprise. Although he'll eat anything (eyeglasses, lightbulbs, birdhouses, ant traps, flea collars, etc.) he's never before begged for more as soon as he's finished (although he will check the other dogs' dishes just in case they missed a morsel).<br /><br />Please note: my five-star rating does not reflect how I would rate this product, which I did not sample, but on the dogs' enthusiastic response."
1,"If it was only up to our dogs, they would eat this all the time. They have always come when it is time to eat, but with this one, they seem to come faster. We usually feed beneful, but even the picky one comes running for this brand. I can't really objective judge what is appealing to dogs -- they have different sense perception, but they seem to prefer this, and we are not usually too picky about what we get them, either."
1,"We were house sitting for our neighbors the past couple of weeks and found this item that we thought might come in handy especially with their 2 pups... or 1 dog and 1 pup (don't know the age limit for canines!)<br /><br />Anyway, Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin literally drove them wild.  Their owners feed them Purina Dog Chow but once we opened the bag and pour a bowl full for each they dove right in and went scurrying to the bag when we put it down-- something that didn't happen with Purina.<br /><br />When they came back, our neighbor, Ricardo, commented on how much the dogs seems to prefer the Chef Michael's.  Now, I don't know what they're paying for the Purina or if the Chef Michael's would be a treat here and there, but one thing is certain-- The Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin made quite an impression on those dogs.  They really, really love the taste of this stuff."
1,"My dachsund just gobbles this up right away, he LOVES LOVES LOVES this grilled sirloin!  I mixed it with it Beneful, so as not to switch dogfoods on him right away and upset his small stomach, and he always picks through and nom nom noms the sirloin meaty pieces straight away before eating the rest of the dry food later, thats how much he loves Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dog Food.  Dobey is pretty picky, too.  Often his food sits around all day and he only eats as he gets hungry, but now the second it hits the bowl, he swoops in for the kills and just makes light of CM dog food, then takes his time as usual with the rest of his food, lol.  Plus this is much healthier than his other dog foods we've been through (Meijer Dog Brand and Purina Beneful), so even though it is more expensive, it seems the cost is definitly worth it.  My dog insists I continue with this brand, lol.  He absolutly salivates now and stands by his bowl when it's empty, which he has NEVER done before.  He doesn't beg for people food nearly as much (still for meat, yes, but not caring as much for anything else), and when I say my dog begs, he has very good manners which involve just sitting and watching me eat lol.  He couldn't care less unless it's meat.  This new dried food just OWNS everything else he's ever had.  Highly recommended, the price might be higher but it's also healthier for your dog baby and he will just love and appreciate you and the food so much more!  I've never seen my little guy so active as he's been since eating this lately, I can't get him to come in from outside, and he's such an indoor dog, so that's a good thing, too!  5 stars all the way for me!  Just wish it was a little cheaper."
0,"Chef Michael's Sirloin Steak dog food is candy for dogs. They, mine included, seem to snarf it up like kids love junk food.  The problem is that it IS junk food. It's filled with ingredients that should be avoided but are likely to be highly palatable to dogs and may also be appealing to their owners. Doesn't Grilled Sirloin Steak sound yummy?<br /><br />Let's start with the easy part, price. I feed my dog dry Eukanuba. To compare,  Chef Michel's costs 14 cents an ounce vs. 9.4 cents an ounce for Eukanuba. It is even more expensive considering that it contains 2% more moisture than Eukanuba.<br /><br />Now, what's the problem with the ingredients in Chef Michael's?  Here's the list of what's in it:<br /><br />Beef,  soybean meal,  soy flour,  animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), brewers rice,  soy protein concentrate,  corn gluten meal,  ground yellow corn, glycerin,  poultry by-product meal, ground wheat, animal digest, pearled barley, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, salt, grilled sirloin steak flavor, dried green beans, dried potatoes, sulfur, Vitamin E supplement, choline chloride, zinc sulfate, ferrous sulfate, added color (Red 40, Blue 2, Yellow 5, Yellow 6), niacin, wheat flour, potassium chloride, L-Lysine monohydrochloride, manganese sulfate, Vitamin A supplement, calcium pantothenate, thiamine mononitrate, copper sulfate, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin B-12 supplement, pyridoxine hydrochloride, garlic oil, Vitamin D-3 supplement, folic acid, calcium iodate, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), biotin, sodium selenite.<br />Here are the questionable ingredients, in order of volume in contents:<br /><br />Soybean Meal and Soy Flour: the second and third largest ingredients in Chef Michael's. After removing most of the oil from soybeans by a solvent or mechanical extraction process, grinding the remaining flakes gives you ""soybean meal."" ""Soy flour"" is another byproduct of soybean processing. These are cheap sources of protein filler used to boost the protein content of dog foods. This type of protein does not provide the dog with as much usable protein as does fish, chicken, lamb, beef or other meats. All proteins are not equal in value to the dog.<br /><br />Animal Fat: the fourth largest ingredient, according to the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), animal fat in dog food is obtained from the tissues of mammals and/or poultry in the commercial processes of rendering or extracting. This means ANY animals, including the ""4-D animals"" (dead, diseased, disabled, or dying prior to slaughter), goats, pigs, horses, rats, roadkill, animals euthanized at shelters and restaurant and supermarket refuse. This is NOT a quality ingredient.<br /><br />Brewers Rice: the fifth ingredient, is the small milled fragments of rice kernels left after milling whole rice.  Although it has calories, it has little nutritional value.<br /><br />Soy Protein Concentrate: what remains of soybeans after removing the water soluble carbohydrates from the beans.  Similar to soybean meal and flour, this is an inexpensive way to boost protein, but contains a very low quality of protein.<br /><br />Corn Gluten Meal: yet, another plant-based protein booster. Gluten is the residue remaining after corn has had most of its starchy carbohydrate washed out of it.  It has little nutritional value, and is used mainly as a filler and binder.<br /><br />Corn: an inexpensive filler with little nutritional value for the dog.<br /><br />Poultry Byproduct Meal: a dry rendered product of slaughterhouse waste made from what's left of slaughtered poultry after all the prime cuts have been removed.  This includes almost anything left after the actual meat has been removed: organs (the nourishing part), feet, beaks, undeveloped eggs -- anything except quality skeletal muscle (real meat). Although, by-product meals are meat concentrates and contain nearly 300% more protein than fresh poultry, they are less digestible than chicken meat. Also, there is absolutely no control over the quality and consistency of poultry and other meat byproducts.<br /><br />Wheat: See the comments for corn, above.<br /><br />Animal Digest: a broth made of animal by-products that is usually sprayed onto the dry kibble to improve its taste.  Although it cannot contain hair, horns, teeth, hooves and feathers, except in such trace amounts as might occur unavoidably in good factory practice, it is made of unspecified parts of unspecified animals. As with animal fat, there is no control over quality or contamination and may include ""4-D animals"" (dead, diseased, disabled, or dying prior to slaughter), goats, pigs, horses, rats, roadkill, animals euthanized at shelters and restaurant and supermarket refuse.<br /><br />Artificial Colorings: solely to appeal to the dog owner. These ingredients are of no nutritional value and are controversial.<br /><br />Menadione: a controversial form of vitamin K linked to liver toxicity, allergies and the abnormal break-down of red blood cells.  It is unnecessary in dog food."
0,"If my dog was writing this review he would give Chef Michael's dog food five stars.  He loved it and wolfed it down.  The kids even used pieces of the food for training games and he eagerly participated.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the dog and I have a different idea of what smells good.  Large amounts of soy give my dog (just a year old) horrendous gas.  I actually didn't read the label before I fed it to him which was completely my fault.  I assumed that a dog food marketed as gourmet would have better quality ingredients.<br /><br />It clearly is very palatable to dogs.  Owners will need to look carefully at the ingredients and decide if it works for them."
0,"Go to Brenda Frank's excellent and compelling review and it is what I agree with completely.  Very good job Brenda and cannot think of anything you have left out.<br /><br />I found this from the University of Pennsylvania on the issue of feeding soy to animals:<br /><br />Soy has been linked to gas and deadly bloat in dogs. It is high in purines and is therefore a completely inappropriate protein source for urate-forming dogs. It is also high in silicates and promotes the formation of silica stones.<br /><br />This is just a small sample of the harm soy can cause your dog.<br /><br />When the world was touting the advantages of soy I jumped on that bandwagon and within time I became very sick.  I will not do that to my dog.<br />Kidney stones? Have you ever had kidney stones? well I have and it is extremely painful and I do not wish for my dog to endure it.<br /><br />I am a reviewer for Amazon and love doing this and I always try to give my best review being fair and objective.  This time I was thrown a curve, this is the first 1 star rating I am giving to one of the products that Amazon has offered to me for review.  My dog means the world to me and to even consider giving him something that is this harmful is not going to happen.<br /><br />Sure beef is the first ingredient but the following ingredients are so against anything I will feed my dog.<br />My dog has been fed raw meat, ground and frozen to kill harmful pathogens, for the past few years. My vet does not like this practice but admits my dog is one of his healthiest patients.<br />I was wondering if I was not being fair to my dog and felt he may like to try some kibble for a change.  But when this came and I read that it contained so much soy and soy byproducts I decided that my dog is getting a much better diet than this food can offer.<br />I am sorry I cannot recommend this product in all good conscience."
1,"I saw the commercial for this and thought I'd give it a try. My dogs are very picky eaters and often leave kibble behind in their bowl. I end up having to throw them out cuz they refuse to eat them again. I normally buy a bag of dog food with a variety of flavors and textures like Chewy pieces and meat filled nuggets, etc but often time they leave certain flavors/kibble behind. But when I purchased two bags of the Canine Creations ... OMG ! Not a Crumb nor Kibble was left behind. I believe it's made from freeze-dried beef and kibble pieces. Moose *One of my dogs* can be a pig sometimes when he comes across something delicious. He won't share with his sister. This is one of them. The daily recommended feeding is 1 cup so I put one cup but Moose would eat every last bit and not leave any for his sister. I tried maybe 2 cups so they'll be some left but then he'd just eat all 2 cups. I tried separating their bowls but she won't eat without her brother. So I just hand feed her and let him eat outta the bowl. I know spoiled but Chef Michael's Canine Creation is FOR SURE thee best Dog Food I have purchased. I'm gonna be continually purchasing these for my dogs from now on. If I could I'd actually rate this 10+ stars !!"
0,"My dog devoured this stuff like she was starved, so I know she would give this product a 5 star rating. As her owner, the only one can read the ingredients, I give it a 1 star.<br /><br />The amount of soybean, soy flour, soy protein, corn products and wheat is, hands down, the worst thing to give an older dog with a weak digestive system. The product may have all the vitamins and supplements needed for a balanced diet and yes, it does have ""gilled sirloin steak flavor"", but it's not a good everyday meal for my dog. Also, the poultry by-product meal ingredient just grosses me out.<br /><br />The $9.99 price for 4.5 pounds might also be cost-prohibitive for most dog owners. So, much to my dog's dismay, this is not a product I will be purchasing for her in the future. (Sorry Millie!)"
0,"My bad - I got sucked in by the Chef Michael name. I know he is a famous chef so I thought he would have the integrity to only sell his name to a high quality product line. After reading the ingredient list I'm not so sure. Too much soy, not enough protein. Plus all the low quality by-products in it, I'm not going to let my dog eat anymore. Sure my dog loved it but I love him too much to feed him garbage."
0,"Yes, the first ingredient is meat, but do not be fooled. The following ingredients include multiple soy ingredients to make up most all the protein content. All the soy and corn ingredients are conventional which means they are cheap, GMO, ingredients. The unimpressive ingredient list also includes multiple artifical colors...these are for the owner's benefit. If you want a healthy dog that lives a long time, find a better, natural dog food that doesn't rely heavily (if at all) on grains(Amazon offers a multitude of options). Dogs aren't designed to eat such high amounts of grains. When factoring cost remember that dogs won't need to eat as much if it is quality food, and ultimately you'll spend less on vet bills."
0,"Our dogs ate this food perfectly fine, but then again, they eat just about anything. We have a Weimaraner and a Husky. Both seem to love the smell and dove right in. My husband said he thought he saw some of the big chewy pieces in the dogs' poop the next day...maybe they aren't getting digested fully?<br /><br />I, like other reviewers, wasn't impressed with the ingredients list. Lots of soy and corn and by-products. Also, they have added colors! Really? Who is eating this...dogs! Dogs don't need colored bits. This is dog food being marketed toward humans who like colors. Silliness.<br /><br />The ""chewy"" bits are more rubbery feeling than ""tender"" and ""meaty"". Also, it seems pretty expensive for something that is loaded with soy and corn and by-products. The more I think about it and write this review the more I'm thinking it's more like a 2-star dog food. Not impressed."
1,"I was surprised that my dogs (Tibetan Terrier and TT mutt) loved this dry food. They went CRAZY over it. Mixed with a little water or milk, they were even more happy. It is now a special treat rather than day to day food. They're grateful for this, thanks Amazon Vine for letting us try a new product."
1,We have Chihuahua's and they absolutely LOVE this food so much that it's like a snack to them. In fact the first couple times I filled up their food bowl they looked at me like wow you are giving me a whole bowl of snacks. Between the two of my dogs they will easily devour a medium size bowl in 20 minutes. Otherwise they may take all day to eat a bowl.<br /><br />I can't say I blame them because it looks and feels just like pieces of freeze dried steak with veggies included. Not that I would ever want to try but if I had to eat dog food this is what I would choose. I can honestly say that I think this is the most interesting dog food that I have ever seen.<br /><br />I will be giving them this food mixed with their regular food for now otherwise they will eat way too much.
0,"I would have thought my 2 year Corgi would have liked this, but he reluctantly ate only one bowl and then stopped eating it altogether. I left it out for him 24 hours before I decided not to let him starve, so I went back to his old food. I don't know why he doesn't like it. The food itself is kind of funny looking: the meat particles look like exploded, freeze dried chunks. Artificial looking. There are regular, round, colored morsels representing the vegetable part of the mix. I can't really comment on the rest of it. Never seen him reject a dog food before."
0,"This is far from the worst dog food on the shelf. However, MUCH better foods are available for MUCH less money.<br /><br />If you know anything about canine nutrition, or care enough about your pet to want to feed them something that's good for them, you probably won't pick this food. Yes, it's better than Wallyworld's Old Roy (which fails my two tests below much worse than this does), but it's far from great. Here's why:<br /><br />Like all other crappy dog foods (95% of what's on the shelf at the store), this food includes corn. Dogs do not digest corn well. It makes for terrible dog food. The only good thing about this food is that beef is the first ingredient. After that, it goes downhill fast. There isn't another good ingredient until you get to dried green beans, and there's practically none in the bag (calcium phosphate and salt both come before the green beans). And that's the only other decent ingredient in the whole bag.<br /><br />Here are my own personal rules for selecting a good dog food:<br /><br />1. If the word ""corn"" appears ANYWHERE in the ingredients, I pass. It's not good for the dog. Other grains are more okay: rice (preferably brown, not brewers), etc. A few non-corn grains are fine, but you don't want your pet eating mostly grains. While omnivorous (most fruits and veggies are great), dogs are Carnivores.<br /><br />2. Meat must be high on the ingredients list, preferably in the #1 position (""meal"" is okay; just means dried meat. ""By-products"" are not okay: that means ground up bones and toenails). This food does okay based on this one metric. Doesn't make it great though.<br /><br />Those two rules pretty much guarantee you'll weed out the junk. And yes, Science Diet is junk, despite what your vet told you.<br /><br />3. My $ rule: $1 a pound or less, because I'm frugal. This is about the price point where great dog foods are obtainable (that doesn't mean all expensive dog foods are good; in fact, all of the big brands (purina, iams, pedigree, eukanuba, science diet, etc) are all well-marketed, overpriced junk). The only major exception to the ""good food usually costs more"" rule that I've noticed is Costco's dog food, which is actually pretty good, and only about 25 bucks for a 40 pound bag. Best deal in canine nutrition, I think.<br /><br />This food is incredibly expensive, over two bucks a pound. You can do a lot better. For that price, you can get any of the highest quality dog foods available locally.<br /><br />Where'd I get my info? A lot of research. Start with a google search for the Whole Dog Journal's annual review of dog foods. It's the most authoritative thing out there.  Additionally, my wife is a dog trainer (the Best Friends type, not the Cesar Milan type; corn is to dog food what the ""dog whisperer"" is to dog training: junk) and works at our local humane society, where they get to test a LOT of donated foods.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and I teach the Mammalogy course at our local university. I understand mammalian anatomy and digestion.<br /><br />If you care about your pet, do your homework, people. And please don't use the ""but my dog likes this brand"" test. I love ice cream, and would eat it at every meal if I could, but my wife tells me it's not good for me. Cheap dog foods are loaded with grease to make dogs want it. Doesn't make it healthy."
1,"I'm not sure what is about this food, but my dog absolutely loves it!! So much so that she sniffs at her other food and will root around to get the last pieces of Chef Michael's. What I noticed immediately is that it smells like human food and has a soft, moist texture. The bag was easy to open and easy to reseal. I'm not sure if I can find this food yet in my area, but after the response my dog had, I think I'm going to have to, as she wants nothing to do with her old food!"
1,"My dog is a finicky eater, but with Chef Michael's she actually eats her whole bowl of food everyday which she never used to do, it is made with high quality ingredients, packaged really well and probably the best dog food we've come across so far."
1,"The dogs loved it...they ate it like I was giving them treats...all 4 had a shiny coat...if I can find it on sale, I will be sure to buy it"
1,My dog absolutely loves this food! He is such a finicky eater and I seriously have to coax and bribe him into trying new foods and yet this one he took to immediately! I was so pleased that he took to it right away and finished the whole bowl! He always leaves more than half and now he eats it all and is satisfied. So happy that I tried this brand!
1,"When I opened the bag the dog food almost smelled like food a human could eat, not that I was willing to test that theory ... but it's definitely the best smell ever from a bag of dog food.<br />The chunks are a good size for a medium-sized dog and mixed in are crunchy kibbles, but better than that, the chunks have a slightly softer-then-usual consistency, so the dog can chew them easily and appreciate more of the flavor, IMHO.<br />Because it's not the best thing to do to instantly switch a dog over to a new diet (you should do it in stages), I've been using a handful of the dog food as a treat after filling my dog's bowl full of his usual food, and he seems to think it's an acceptable luxury.<br />Dogs need a high protein diet, so anything will real meat in it is going to be a good for him/her. Chef Michael's bag doesn't say exactly what percentage of the food is protein, but it claims to have real beef as its #1 ingredient. The dog food includes potatoes and green bean garnishes (whatever that means - to me a garnish is for decoration) and 23 essential vitamins and minerals. Unfortunately, none of the ingredients are organic.<br />Overall, I'd buy this if I had a smaller dog I wanted to give good food to, but the cost is a downer if you are feeding a larger animal."
1,I fed this to four dogs (all mutts) and they all loved it. I normally feed them Science Diet (different varieties) which I obtain from my veteranarian but they go after the Chef Michael's with a lot more zeal.<br /><br />So my plan now is to give them the Chef Michael's dog food about every fifth meal because my dogs are old and they need the various Science Diet foods for their specific problems. But the Chef Michael's will give them a nice variety.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
1,"My little chiweenie, Darryl, loves this dog food!  The meat pieces in Chef Michael's creation are, of course, his favorite and we use them for treats a lot of the time.  Darryl also eats up the potato and green bean pieces just as well.  I haven't had a problem with Darryl gorging himself on this food, as other reviewers have stated, but I could see how that could happen with larger dogs.<br /><br />Since I don't like to spend a lot on dog food, this 4.5 lb. bad prices in at under $10 with Amazon's ""subscribe & save"" feature, plus for a limited time you can also receive 15% off with Amazon's clippable coupons.<br /><br />The food's number one ingredient is meat, followed by soy products.<br /><br />I will try the other Chef Michael's creations as well!"
1,"This dog food is a little spendy for the quality but it definitely appeals to my dog's taste. So we have been using it as a little ""appetizer"" mixed in with the rest of her dinner, on the nights when her appetite is sluggish due to the weather. The kibbles are nice and small for little dogs (she's about 9 lbs)."
1,I have rottweiler and he used eat just about anything. Now that he is older he seems to be a bit picky. I placed this food next to his regular food that I feed him and he chose this Chef Michael's food. This bag is not the cheapest but I get every once in a while to cycle their food. Great ingredients and I am sure the dog liked the taste of the food.
1,"I love giving my dog Bo a variety of dog foods so that he does not get bored with the same taste day after day. Sometimes when I give him a new dog food to try he will turn up his nose and walk away. When I poured the Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin dog food into his bowl, he dug right in! Bo didn't stop eating until the bowl was empty. Bo's review for this dog food is 5 stars - he loves it!"
1,"My dog really liked this and she can be a picky eater. She reacted more like it was a treat than regular brkst/dinner so it must be yummy for her. As far as ingredients go its not that much beter than your regular pet food, but not as good as most that you would find at the Vet's office still we will definetly try this from time to time since our dogs likes when we switch it up a bit."
1,"I have a giant dog.  If he were standing on his hind legs he would tower over me and I'm 6'3"" tall.  I don't know how much he weighs but I would suspect it's well over 200 pounds.  He is a Great Dane and he is, in fact, great.  So I imagine that, like me, he probably likes sirloin.  I mean who wouldn't right?  He can consume an entire hamburger in- literally- one bite.  So I supplement his incredible diet of pizza and hamburgers with Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food.  Admittedly a 4.5 pound bag is the equivalent to an afternoon snack for me but, hey, he's worth it.  It's not easy being a dog the size of a small horse so only the best for my beast."
1,"Chef Michael's has both soft (not necessarily moist, but soft) meat pieces and harder small pieces, so most dogs should be fine, even if they have a difficult time eating standard hard dog food. The product also lives up to its name with meat being the first ingredient.  Chef Michael's was preferred by my beagle over Iams."
0,"After reading all the reviews I thought my dog was going to scarf this food down. He didn't and because of that I know he didn't really love it. Also, this food smells really bad. I don't know if I just never notices bad dog food smell before but as I was pouring this into his bowl, I was like ""Ewwww"". I will not buy this food for my dog."
1,My dog loves this food. She seems very happy and has been looking good. Her coat is so pretty and shiny. I asked her how she liked it and she only barked but she seemed excited about it.
0,"I should start by stating that my dogs have never eaten dog food that wasn't organic and made from the same ingredients that humans consume. They digest it well and they are healthy.  I decided to give this dog food a chance because it's inexpensive, and I fell for the slick marketing. I'm not sure what I was thinking!  I thought they might turn their noses up at the new food, but they loved it.  I only gave them a handful each to test it out, and I think they thought they just received a handful of treats!  Many hours later, however, their stomachs started to rumble and they became a little sick.  The low quality ingredients are hard to digest, especially for dogs that are used to human-grade foods  (in other words, they eat REAL food).  I feel guilty for even trying this.  I'll stick with organic dog foods from now on.  They do cost more, but when your dogs are like family, why skimp on something so important?  I recommend Newman's Own dry dog food for a lower cost organic that is still high quality."
1,"I chose this dog food seeing grilled sirloin on the description.I figured the dogs would like it alot.Well,they sure did""""They scarfed it down so fast it was as if we hadnt fed them in a week.Its very soft food and would be good for older dogs that have messed up teeth and cant chew very well.The ingredients could be alot better.The first ingredient is beef and thats good for them.Ingredients are listed with the main ingredient first just as all food products are.The rest is a list of all kinds of stuff most likely not to good for them.I see many people knocking it and thats fine.I would bet they didnt throw it away though""""Ten bucks is a little pricey for 4.5 pounds of food i feel.I guess im a cheepskate""""I most likely would not buy it.Sorry purina."
1,"Not sure how nutritious this food is.. It's not rated very well with the dog food community ingredient wise but my dogs LOVED IT. I mixed it in with their normal Kirkland brand food and it made them eat their normal food with little bits of this food like it was the best thing they have had in their lives.. The dogs felt like it was treats, versus food it smelled and tasted good for them..<br /><br />I wouldn't feed this on a normal basis due to the ingredients ( even though beef is first ), but for a dog that needs help eating, a treaty meal or stimulating appetite this might be a good food enhancer."
1,"But I will continue to feed them Purina One products with a little of this mixed in for a treat. They have been raised on Purina and now are senior dogs and I don't want to change their diet. But I have to say they really liked it although they didn't seem to pick out the Chef Michael pieces.<br /><br />I would purchase, but not as a full time diet."
1,"THOR (the dog) liked this one, with no problem.  It met all our needs for a store-bought dry dog food that is handy and convenient to use.  Yes, I agree with some of the other reviewers, that this would (of course!) not be a fully-desired complete nutritional program, over time, but that kind of attention and augmentation to diet is one of the responsibilities of the pet owner, anyway.  That is called ""loving attention.""<br /><br />We are glad to have the security of the vitamins and minerals that are included.  At under 5 pounds per bag, it is easy to pack and convenient to take along, especially for camping trips or temporary stop-overs, where planning and convenience trump freshness, temporarily.  Recommended."
1,"Well, three out of the three dogs who tried this brand did really seem to enjoy it, and it's easy to see why when meat is the first ingredient listed (as advertised).  There seems to be a good amount of protein to Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry, which the dogs enjoy, and some nice veggie flavoring, but I'd probably consider this more a treat than an every day meal unless you have a small dog and can stretch a 4.5 pound bag to last a while - it's not quite the value as some other brands out there, even if the dogs do enjoy it."
1,"I've had dogs since I was a kid, and we've fed them everything from cat food to dog food to people food.  Dogs aren't that particular (do you know how much it costs to make 'steak' treats look like steak?  The dogs don't care what it looks like!) but clearly there are some foods they prefer.  Chef Michael (whoever he is) knows how to serve 'em up.  My dog chowed down on this and finished his bowl during our dinner. He NEVER does that...he'd rather beg for food (which we usually don't give him) than stick with what he already has.  Not this time.  He eats it down to the bowl whenever we refill it...that's some serious appreciation for a dog food, one I've never seen before.<br /><br />The bag say that real beef is the number 1 ingredient.  I say it doesn't matter...the dog loves it and, as near as I can tell, its nutritious (mostly) and will keep.  There may be soy and corn in it, but those are fillers.  They aren't unhealthy, they just don't add a lot of food to the food.  It might matter more if the dog was a puppy, but the bag clearly identifies that it is for an adult dog. Last, about the ingredients, if it is beef, I also don't know that there's THAT much nutrition for a dog.  There's protein and that's good...I will keep serving him this."
0,"I'm a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FVTQJQ"">Purina Beneful Healthy Weight, 7-Pounds</a> user and my beagle loves it. When I saw this premium looking dog food I decided to try it out and give my dog a treat. The problem is that she wouldn't eat it. And looking at it I can see why (check my pic above.)<br /><br />This food is gross looking and smelling. My dog sniffed it for a second but wouldn't go after it. I left it out for her during the day and over night and she never touched it.<br /><br />Some dogs may go for it so I can't say it's a bad product. But I can say that it was a bad product for me and my pet. I don't recommend it.<br /><br />NOTE: I'll be giving this away to a family member for her daschunds and I'll update it if they liked it to be fair."
1,"Emmy is somewhat picky but tore into this dog food.  It is obvious that she enjoys the taste of the food and it appears to have no ill effects on her digestive track at all.  Obviously a five in her book.  As for why I give it a four - the ingredients list does hold a number of less than healthy items.  I would feel a little better if she were eating a healthier dog food, but I can't throw the first stone when it comes to enjoying a tasty but less then healthy meal from time to time."
1,"This is fancy-schmanzy gourmet dog food by Purina, with similar sort of ingredients to other Purina products, but the dogs certainly gathered around when I served it! It wouldn't be ideal for a dog with certain sensitivities (check the ingredient list before purchasing), and it's probably a little rich for my two who are both getting pudgy, but for an occasional treat, or for younger and more active dogs, it is just fine. There is the convenience of dry food, too; I'm not much for messy canned food. Once my pudgy puppies slim down, they can have it more often."
1,"I figured that a dog food made with beef and Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavor would smell really good to a dog, but I did a little test.  I put one dog's regular food in a paper bowl and the new food in another paper bowl--so that the bowls wouldn't interfere with the test.  Then I put the old food on the floor in its regular place, and I put the new food further away.  The dog smelled her regular food first, and then she started sniffing all over in the air until she tracked down the new food.  She gobbled that up and then ate her regular food.  The next time I put the new food further away--behind the dog food storge container--and she tracked it down and ate it first again before eating her regular food.  (I divided the food half and half so it would be her regular amount.)<br /><br />""Real Beef is our #1 ingredient"" it says on the bag.  In the list of ingredients that is followed by soybean meal, soy flour and lots of additives, including the dyes and corn products, etc., plus 23 essential vitamins and minerals.  Green beans and potatoes are listed as garnishes.  There are crunchy kibbles and tender pieces, which I'm assuming is the beef.  It's for adult dogs, and the product is now made by the Nestle Purina Pet Care Company.  A company in Switzerland owns the trademarks.  (I trusted Purina.)<br /><br />The instructions say to gradually mix the old regular food with the new, which I always do--except for the two tests.  Btw, while studying the information on the bag and making notes at the dining room table, the dogs were all over me.  One wanted to climb up on the table via my lap; fortunately he's short.  (He picked the beef pieces out of his regular food earlier; it was mixed together.)"
1,"MY dog actually liked this dry food, which is surprising because he never likes dry dog food...So clearly the makers of this product got the taste right with this. But this is definitely not something you want to feed your dog daily as it is substandard when it comes to nutritional value. BUT , I can see myself giving this a  couple times a week as a break for sure though.<br />Overall, if your like me, with a picky dog when it comes to dry dog food, give this a try. I dont recommend giving this daily, but it could be a nice complement to your dogs regular food (if your dog likes it!)."
1,"I hate to admit it, but I actually taste new dry dog food brands before giving any to my pooches.  You wouldn't believe how awful some dog food really is.  I knew Chef Michael's was a winner from the get-go.  The dogs just love it, and I feel good knowing it's loaded with vitamins/minerals, and the primary ingredient is either beef (grilled sirloin flavor) or chicken (oven roasted chicken).  Unlike some dog food, Chef Michael's isn't overly-sweet or heavily laden with corn.  My older dog is finicky and has a little trouble chewing, but she can easily (and readily) eat this.  It's a blend of soft pieces and smaller kibble.  Mixing with a little water helps even more.<br /><br />My one complaint is expense.  Dog food prices, particularly better quality brands, have skyrocketed.  I refuse to buy junk, so must take advantage of sales and coupons.  I often wonder what the actual cost to make dog food products really is.  Ten dollars for a 4.5 lb bag of dog food seems extravagant."
1,"Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food puts other dog foods to shame. This 4.5 pound bag is filled with Real Beef which is Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavor, Potato, and Green Been Garnishes. Sounds like a proper steak house meal right? It looks like it too, what you see on the outside of the bad is exactly what you get on the inside, big chunky pieces of beef that your dog will go crazy over. Even my cat stopped eating her food and tried to sneak a nibble of this she was so enticed. With 23 extra vitamins this is an excellent choice for a healthy adult dog. I would highly recommend this to any dog lover."
1,"The Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dog Food is really good stuff.  The dogs enjoyed sniffing the food, then ate it right up with no digestion problems as far as I could tell.<br /><br />The only other thing I can tell you is, I've never seen the dogs so eager to eat in my life since we received the new Chef Michael's dog food.<br /><br />Five stars, recommended.<br /><br />Barb Caffrey"
1,"Our dogs love this food, but I don't know if it is any better for them than any other mass produced dog food.<br /><br />If you are looking for a rating of the taste of this food, I can assure you that our two Pugs love it.  They wolf it down in record time (which is saying something since they are always quite fast).  Every morsel of this food seems like it is delicious to them.<br /><br />I am not qualified to comment on the nutrition of this food.  It seems to be very similar to all the other mass produced, shelf stable, dog food on the market.  I can't imagine it is great for them, but isn't really doing them any harm either.<br /><br />I recommend this food, and find that the price from Amazon is pretty competitive with other mail order dog food and even some brick and mortar retail locations."
1,"Nutritionally compares well with most commercial dog food products. The dogs, however, love it so much that they gorge themselves when we are used to free-grazing feeding. We have found we cannot let them free-graze with this food; they will eat until they are sick.  We have decided to use this food for training treats as it is too enticing to let them have a bowlful. Plus with two dogs, one will get left out, depending upon which one gets to the food first."
1,The dogs eat it up when I put it in their bowl and they don't leave behind any messy crumbs like other dogs foods do. The texture of the food is spongy and soft that is very nice for my two aging dogs that have lost some of their teeth. No over strong odor from the food either makes it a meal for the dogs.
0,I thought for sure that our dog was going to inhale this food.  He will pretty much gobble up just about anything you put in front of him so I fully expected Chef Michael's Gilled Sirloin to be a hit with him especially after seeing so many reviews saying that their dog loved this food.  I was shocked when I gave it to our dog and after chewing the first bite he actually spit it out.  I tried getting him to eat more of it but he wasn't having it.  I guess there is something out there that he won't eat.
1,"My little 1.5 lbs yorkie mix loves these tiny bites.  I will sit down with her and pull the little steak bits out and throw them to her.  She loves to jump and chase them.  She also seems to be pretty happy with the harder kibble bits, although she doesn't chase those, so they must be less appealing.  Normally she is a very finicky eater, but really likes this food.  She also has had no digestive issues with it at all.<br /><br />My 20lbs mongrel sweetheart dog loves this too.  She isn't a picky eater, but the wrong food makes picking up after her in the park a nightmare.  I allowed her to try this anyway and have had no digestive issues at all.  She also seems to think the chewy steak bits are super treats.<br /><br />I will definitely repurchase this food.  The price on Amazon at this point is about $2 cheaper than my local grocery store."
1,"The doggies (Nena, Samantha and Spike) love this dog food - and that's saying something.  Chef Michael's come up with a great product here.  The only problem:  The bag is too small (but, perhaps that's the point?).  Purchase a bag in your local grocery and try it out.  I think you'll be pleased.<br /><br />At my local Ralph's grocery, the bag retails for $11.99 (relatively expensive, but it is a great dog food - the dogs actually eat their bowls clean!)<br /><br />I rate ""Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food (4.5 Pound Bag)""...Five stars!<br /><br />Recommended!"
1,"My two dogs, a chiweiner and a chowrot, loved me very much the day I brought this home. They have been fed the same dog food all of their lives and couldn't wait to dig into this one. They left their regular food alone. I don't know what is so special but the first ingredient is beef so that seems alright. I really know how else to rate it as I don't eat it but my dogs gave it five paws up."
0,"In a nutshell -- the dogs (both under 20 lbs)in(2) separate households tried this product and they scoffed it down without a morsel left in the bowl, but unlike cats these dogs are not terribly fussy.<br /><br />It does look appealing, but when reading the top ingredients, and considering the price, it doesn't seem to be a wise or an economical food for the dogs.<br /><br />But the number one reason is, both dogs became very gassy (I'm guessing from large amounts of soy). Honestly, this is not something pet owners want to have to deal with on a regular basis.<br /><br />Not recommended."
1,"My dogs are finicky about what they eat.  Basically, one of my dogs doesn't care for any brand of dog food and only eats it when he's famished.  We've tried the expensive stuff (Eukanuba & Blue) and the cheap stuff (Purina & other brands) and he hates them all equally.<br /><br />The most notable thing about Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin dog food is it's appearance.  It really does look like petrified pieces of beef, and you can see the vegetables in it.  Also, the number one ingredient is beef, which is unusual.  Even the high-end brands mentioned above do not have meat products as their main ingredient, but have corn listed first.<br /><br />Taste test on this product was a success; both my dogs ate it.  And my cat, who only eats meat products, had a few bites too, which is a verification of the meat content, in my opinion.<br /><br />The cost is not prohibitive, especially considering the prime shipping.<br /><br />Will I buy it?  Probably.  I have to wait to make sure my finicky dogs continues eating it until the last morsel is gone.  I've been fooled before."
1,"I'm very happy with beef being the top ingredient in this very nice dog food; meat SHOULD be the top ingredient in a dog's diet. I am happy with the soy products, rice, poultry products, fats, wheat and barley. Those are relatively wholesome foods, and - my guess is - delicious. My dog loves the soft meaty chunks and happily wolfs down the kibble pieces too.<br /><br />Corn is still high in the list, however, as the seventh and eight  ingredient. Corn is a cheap filler, so I understand its common appearance in dog food. Unfortunately, dogs do not digest corn well, and many canines have corn allergies. I would have preferred more of the dried green beans and potatoes, which are lower on the list.<br /><br />I don't really know how to rank this - do I remove a star for adding cheap, indigestible corn? Do I give Purina five stars for what seems to be a sincere attempt at a high-end, beefy, nutritious product?<br /><br />Looking at the list again, I am curious about the high salt content. Do dogs need salt to flavor their food, or is the salt included as a somewhat natural preservative? I'm also concerned that Purina consistently feels a need to include food coloring in dog feed. Color can only possible be for the benefit of the people serving the product, which is a bit mystifying. I assume people aren't eating this. :)<br /><br />So. This is a pet product containing mostly beef and other nutritious options in the end. It just needs to be tweaked with a few omissions of questionable ingredients. A resealable bag would be a nice bonus.<br /><br />If this was marketed as a mid-line feed, I would certainly not hesitate to award five stars for what it is. Since this particular brand is touted as a high-end, discerning palate-type kibble, I'll stick with four stars for now. Kudos to Purina for trying and I hope they keep working at it. :)"
1,"How do you review a dog food that you aren't even going to taste yourself?  Being scientifically accurate, I brought four dogs to the (figurative) table:  two Rat Terriers (Riley and Hawk), a Doberman (Halle), and a Brown Lab (Polo).<br /><br />For testing purposes, I (really, I did!) set out four bowls.  My idea was to let each of them take a choice of the four:  Beneful by Purina, Chef Michael's (this product), Kirkland Lamb & Rice (their regular food), and strangely enough, dry cat food which seems to be a hit with all of them (they obsess over it).<br /><br />Each dog had a turn.  I'm not sure if it was the look of it, because it looks like a real pot roast dinner, but this product got woofed down the fastest.  They didn't even look at the others.  I don't think dogs see in color, so am convinced it wasn't the colorful kibbles.  My testing problem was that trying to take each dog away and put them aside to let the other dogs have a turn at the taste test was fraught with danger. They did NOT want to give it up.  The Kirkland and the Beneful didn't warrant any interest, even when Chef Michael's was gone and those were the only options.  Even the cat food that they usually go for (probably just to get on the cat's nerves) sat unnibbled.<br /><br />So, easy to say, this was a hit.  Small dog and big, none had trouble with the size of the food.  It sort of looks like Chunky Stew without the liquid.  Also, a side bonus was that the gassy little rat terriers didn't seem so gassy after....although, this bag only allowed them four dinners between the four dogs.  Now that it's gone, they are sad.<br /><br />If I could afford this regularly, I would purchase it.  There was no waste, nothing for the blue jays to hit on the next day.  And an unexpected treat is that when you order dog food online, if it's Prime shipping it shows up quick and shipped free...so no lugging it from the store.  I like that convenience of that, and plan on putting dog food on a subscription plan on Amazon so that I don't have to run out when when we frequently run out.  Plus, I get tired of running to Costco for what I'm told is quality food."
1,"All 3 of my dogs loved this food and the first ingredient is beef. My vet recommends the first ingredient be meat and not a filler.  Even our difficult child the bassett hound, did not play her usual dinner time games and just chowed down! They seemed to like to moist kibble the most, but their bowls were cleaned up.<br /><br />Update: My difficult child the bassett ran to her bowl and sat down in anticipation for another meal of Chef Michaels, when her regular chow appeared she turn and gave us the nastiest look and walk away. The food critic has spoken!"
1,"When it comes to dog food, as you can see with the many reviews on Purina Chef Michael's products, you have passionate pet owners who are concerned about their dogs health and feeding them the best food possible.<br /><br />I admire pet owners who can do just that, as I know many who prefer to cook their dogs meal to those who will splurge in order to make sure their dogs eat the best and are healthy.  But with today's economy, I also know that there are owners who can't cook, can't splurge and try to look for the best price that they can to feed their dog(s).<br /><br />Purina's Chef Michels brand sounds like gourmet food for the dogs.  But looking at the price, how can gourmet food be so cheap?  Well, for the Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavor dog food which comes with potato & green bean garnishes, there is no doubt that many dogs will eat it.<br /><br />Ingredients are: Beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, ground yellow corn, glycerin, poultry by-product meal, ground wheat, animal digest, pearled barley, salt, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, natural filet mignon flavor, dried green beans, dried potatoes, added color (Red 40, Blue 2, Yellow 5, Yellow 6 and other color), sulfur, zinc sulfate, Vitamin E supplement, ferrous sulfate and many more.<br /><br />My small adult Pug-tzu's love eating this dry dog food.  It's small and at first they sniffed it but after 10 minutes or so, they began scarfing it down.  I did mix it with other dog food but on its own, I'm sure they enjoy it.  And what I like about it is that Amazon offers it for under $10, Purina does say they use real beef and the crunchy kibbles includes 23 essential vitamins and minerals.  Granted, after eating this, they also tend to have more stools.  I also want to note that my dogs did not produce any horrid flatulence after eating this dog food, like others have reported.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />I'm not an erudite when it comes to what is healthy for dogs and what isn't.  There are many reviews from hardcore dog lovers that you can read on this product to know that many have chimed in and called this ""junk food"" for their dogs.<br /><br />But I also feel that there are many people out there who are dog owners who can't afford to pay so much for their dog's food and the price of this dry dog food is quite appealing.  Purina does claim this particular Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin dry dog food does include 23 essential vitamins and nutrients.<br /><br />So, for the pet owners who are very budget-conscious, are looking for dry dog food that their small dogs will enjoy but also getting the essential vitamins in their meal, then Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog food may be for you."
0,"I use Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food almost as an occasional - and small - treat for my 10-lbs dog, but don't consider it to be good nutrition wise for every day food. Nutrition aside, for small dogs, these pieces are way too large so for that reason alone, I would not recommend this food for small breeds. I give my dog 1 piece and it keeps him occupied with chewing for a good 20 minutes.<br /><br />As far as ingredients go, yes, the first ingredient is in fact beef. However, everything that follows is a junky filler - soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat, rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, etc. Hasn't Purina (the maker of this dog food) heard that soy can be terrible for dog's stomachs? I haven't seen any Purina brands that provide good nutrition for dogs, and this one is no exception."
1,"My mini-Aussie loves this dog food.  Unfortunately, she loves it so much she gobbles it up faster than she does her regular food.  Then she gets hungry faster and wants to eat again.  This is a problem since she's overweight and we're trying to limit her food intake.  I've begun mixing Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin with her regular food to keep her from overeating.<br /><br />When we first received it, my 8 yo and 11 yo sons thought it looked so good, they each tasted a piece of the dried steak.  They informed me that it tastes like beef jerky. No wonder my dog likes it.  Thankfully, my sons haven't kept eating out of the dog bowl."
1,"I gave this to my friends 2 little chihuahuas (sp) and they loved it. They didn't eat as much at one time as they do cheaper brands of food which leads me to believe it is more filling and more satisfying. That also means less poo to get rid of later off the yard when I am taking care of them. The sirloin bits that are soft tend to stick together so if your giving it to a tiny dog then I suggest you pull those chunks apart a bit so they don't get them caught in their throat if they eat too fast. I noticed they sniffed it out and ate all the sirloin chunks first, then ate the rest. They definitely enjoy it and when they see this bag they come running. I do wish the bag ahd been resealable for freshness though. I dumped it all in a huge tupperware so it would stay fresh."
1,"I'm in agreement with the various top reviews for this product, dogs love it, but humans don't. Look at it this way, any product containing only high quality beef is going to cost a lot more than this price and is anyone buying this going to expect 100% beef inside? I partly blame manufacturers for this, they advertise dog food with vegetables on TV. Do we really expect our dogs (carnivores) to be eating steak, mash potatoes and a side of veggies? It seems consumers buy into it and so are also partly to blame for buying them and causing the manufacturers to making and selling more.<br /><br />Anyway, without taking any of the above into consideration my comments on this are:<br />1. Has a good variety of colors and shapes<br />2. We mixed it with other dog food and my dog ate all of the Chef Michael's only!<br />3. Her stool seems to be more than before (more indigestible ingredients?)<br />4. The zip lock bag is good<br /><br />So as far as my dog's opinion goes, she loves it so a 5 star from her!"
0,"Dog food like this is made for the human palate. Just look at the bag...since when can dog's read? If they could they would demand real ingredients with no fillers. Remember your mutt will generally eat anything you will or make funny noises because it smells good. Good dog food does not smell good.<br /><br />I did let my mutts try a handful. True, they swallowed it right down, but the gas and diarrhea that followed was horrendous. The gas was so bad I left the house and let my wife deal with it.<br /><br />No more junk food for my mutts."
1,"Currently, we feed our older Collie the Kirkland brand dog food for senior dogs.  We chose that food after doing online research and the fact that it included glucosamine.  We found out that a lot of dog foods don't so you would have to add a supplement if your dog needed it.<br /><br />We still feed her that food, but now sprinkle a small hand full of this product on top and she gobbles everything in sight and basically licks the bowl clean.<br /><br />I can definitely say that the bag comes pack with the sirloin as in even our little hand fulls, our Collie is getting quite a lot of them."
1,"My dog likes Chef Michaels canned food so we thought we would try the dry food as well.  I put this in a bowl with 2 tea spoons of salt free chicken broth and he went nuts.  He loved it, its good for his teeth and he dances around the kitchen when I appear with his dinner."
1,"My dog loved this, I put a dab of cottage cheese in most of her meals, she loves that stuff...but gave her a dish of this with just a sprinkle of water over it and she wolfed it down! She has been eating the regular 'Beneful' and loves it also, as I need to watch her weight and this product is a bit lower in calories, I might be feeding her this product more often. Its first item listed IS beef, that made me feel good that it's a good quality product. It also says its for dogs of all ages and that its free of artificial preservatives and colors, another good thing."
1,"Our dog has tried near every dog food on the market.  We started him off on one of the premium brands, purchased at our Vet's office.  While that one was balanced nutritionally, he did not particularly like it, and it gave him gas (a noted problem, according to our vet).  Now that he is grown, I have been less concerned about precise balance of nutrients, though I do look for quality ingredients.<br />  With Chef Michael's, you get both nutritional balance and high qual8ity ingredients.  It is one of the very few dog foods which lists meat (in this case beef) as the first ingredient.  It also has grains, vegetables, and vitamins.  He doesn't much care about all of that.  he clearly likes the taste.  yesterday I accidentally gave him half again as much as he usually gets because I tipped the bag too far, and in a very short time it was gone and he was looking for more.<br /><br />  I like that it is packaged in plastic, which preserves it better in our humid environment, and the small bags make it easier to handle.  The one and only downside is the cost, near double what other Purina dog foods sell for.  I also love Amazon delivery, as my biggest challenge has been getting my teen to come to 5the market with me to heft 20+ pound bags of dog food (we have a Big dog :)<br /><br />  In the past we have rotated through several brands to make sure he was getting variety and a balanced diet.  I think I will be adding this one to the rotation.  He very clearly likes it.  It provides a good balance in terms of nutrition, has quality ingredients, and the size and packaging keep it fresh until lit is gone (not very long ;)"
1,"Although the bag is pretty average, this dog food is not, it is definitely a higher end dog food, a cut above the usual dry dog food and and has a fresh looking appearance to it.<br />So how did it taste? well, my dogs seemed to like it, I have noticed they seem to eat ""dry"" dog food when they are hungry rather than when I serve it, however, I they ate this when I served it, not sure a nibble, they would finish it all.<br />A good product, more expensive that typical dog food but if you can afford it, it won't go to waste!"
1,"The dogs literally licked their bowls when they finished with this however the weird greasy feeling that got on my hands from reaching in the bag leaves me wondering how ""good"" this can be for the dogs. The other thing that bothered me is the smell from it, I have never had such a strong smelling food, for the 1st time I have to keep the lid tight on the food container and it in the garage as the dogs tried to open the cabinet we keep it in... Its an odd smell too, and we have tried all different great brands. This is something I am not sure I would buy on my own seeing as my concerns about it but I know the dogs love it!!"
1,"While I'll admit the food smelled strange when I opened the bag, my dog does love this product. It's a little crunchier than her regular food and I like that because I feel it helps clean her teeth instead of something that's easy to chew. If the dog likes it then it's a product that I'll enjoy giving her, and trust me, there are some foods that she sticks her nose up at and refuses to eat. This was not one of them."
1,"My  three dogs went crazy for this food, even the chihuahua. It has a crunchy blend of filet mignon garnished with potatoes and green beans not too bad for dogs, I wouldn't mind having this every day for dinner.  It doesn't look like typical dry food."
1,"This stuff lasted about 20 seconds in the bowl once I put it in.  The dogs loved it and I can recommend it on that alone.  As long as the dogs eat it and dont starve to death what is inside the thing doesnt bother me to much.  They are dogs, they eat poop.  They dont care what you put in front of them, they will eat it.  I have dogs of all size and my little one was able to eat it as soon as she snuck under my big dog.  The pieces are easy enough to chew as I did try, and my teeth are no where as good as theirs, and it seems to digest easily as I havent had any episodes since eating them.  Regardless, I can say this stuff is good enough for me and them.  If you have a dainty dog you might want to try something else, I have junkyard dogs and they will eat anything."
1,"We have 3 large dogs, two labs and a German Shepard-Chow mix. All of the range widely in ages and finickiness with foods. One dog will eat anything in sight, but many things give her gas. Another is picky and gets quite ill of off several different kinds of dog foods. The third dog is sort of in between, will eat most all dog foods, but has never had stomach issues with any of them. I gradually mixed in a little of this food at a time with their usual dog food <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ0B0I"">PURINA Beneful</a>. Then slowly got them till they were eating just this Chef Michael's. All three dogs seemed to enjoy the food and the dog who often gets ill from new dog foods, did not with this one. However our youngest, who will eat anything in sight, did get a little gassy with the food. But it's not uncommon for her to get gassy with her regular food as well. The dogs all enjoy it and seem to have no real problems eating it, anymore than they to their regular Beneful dog food."
1,"We have been Iams and Science Diet fans for the four years of our dog's life, but decided to give this a try when he started being finicky about flavors. He cleans the bowl in about 10 seconds. Our other tiny dog also likes this as much as the super expensive stuff made for ""royalty."" Neither had stomach issues with the change over and they will work for it like a treat. If you are looking for something a notch up form junk dog food, but priced reasonably give the Chef Michael's a try. It even smells good to us!"
1,"The chunks in this packaged dog food look like hunks of beef and freeze dried peas and carrots.  It's a bit chewy but they really love it.  As soon as I opened the bag, they were interested - sniffing around it before I filled their bowls and then they wolfed it down and stood begging for more.  We've been using a different brand for years but this may be a new one that we buy to have as a treat.<br />The kibble really does look tasty out of the bag like chunks of real grilled meat.  Chef Michael knows how to cook for pups.  It will be something I'll recommend to friends with dogs and will continue to use myself.  Thanks, Chef Michael or should I say ""Woof, woof"" which is what my dogs would say."
1,"I won't dispute the fact that Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin is somewhat expensive and may not be the healthiest choice in dry dog food, but there is no denying the fact that dogs love it. Heck, I have 2 cats and even they enjoy snacking on it when the dog isn't around. Perhaps it isn't ideal nutrition, but I don't think it is as bad as some other reviewers have made it out to be. In any event, this is more of a treat food than a diet staple, and when viewed in that light, it is actually healthier and much more cost effective than many of those little packages of doggie treats that line the grocery store shelves.<br /><br />Place a serving of this next to a bowl of ""healthy"" store brand dog food and there is no comparison. Aesthetically it looks better, but I know that isn't what dogs care about. The bowl of Chef Michael's food will be eaten first every time. My suggestion is to either mix it in with your regular dry food, or use it as a treat. If you are overly concerned by the ingredients in your pet's food, then you may find issue with this brand. Also, there is no ""zip-lock"" to re-seal it so you'll need a large, strong clip to keep the bag closed. Or you can use an large plastic container like I do. Otherwise, this pet food gets two paws up!"
1,If you are in a dwelling with a dog you soon realize that there is not an infinite variety of food available.  You hope to find something the dog likes.  This one worked for me (us).
1,"Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food 4.5 Pound Bag<br /><br />What a dog I got, his favorite bone is in my arm. --Rodney Dangerfield  :)<br /><br />*reads label* ""A delightful crunchy blend of filet mignon garnished with potatoes and green beans. This delectable dish is full of meaty goodness that will make your dog's mouth water. Nothing delights your dog like the ultimate steak flavor.""  Okay, into my Shopping Cart it goes. :)<br /><br />As I am not about to taste the food ( myself ), My dogs ( Rottweilers ) will tell me the rest:<br /><br />Opened up Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food, and let my Guys have an initial sniff. (I've learned this is very important -- if mine just sit there, they will probably not eat it).  Their eyes really lit up and you could tell they were getting excited about trying something new and different.<br /><br />The dog food does have a nice variety of earthy colors and shapes - to stimulate their minds - , and has a very pleasant aroma.  Nothing annoying to the senses, as far as I could tell.  It is a mix of hard and semi-soft foods.<br /><br />They waited for the ""cue"" to eat, and then dove in and woofed all the Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food down, then hunted around the bowl for any possible spilled nuggets.  I knew it was a hit when they sat up and begged for more. Bravo!  *claps hands*<br /><br />Guess they love it, and Purina is a brand I can trust! 'nuf said!<br /><br />Purina does not include a handy zip lock with this particular bag (unless I inadvertently cut it off when using the sissors to open the bag) -- which would have been a ""plus"", if ya know what I mean.  So, I had to hunt around for one of those gigantic potato chip bag clips. But, that's not a biggie, as the bag is only a 4.5 pounder and will probably be eaten a lot sooner than a gigantic bag of the same food.<br /><br />Does Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food sound like what you may be looking for in a dog food? :) I'm off to buy more, as this 4.5 pound bag will not last long, if ya know what I mean!  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2012"
1,"Chef Micahel's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food was satisfying for both of my large dogs (one weighs about 55 pounds, the other around 80 pounds). One will eat almost anything and the other is picky, but they both finished their plates quickly and both were looking for more. So why four stars?  The product does not look nearly as good as the picture and I wish the ingredient list was a little more substantial but the food is satisfying for them, so as long as they are happy and stay healthy - that is what matters."
1,"I will admit that I am not the one who looks at the ingredient lists.  My dogs receive plenty of exercise and have always gotten the thumbs up from our vet.  So I tend to buy what my dogs will eat instead.<br /><br />When this arrived, I refilled the dogs dishes with it and they couldn't get it down fast enough!  They loved it!  I think they enjoyed this better than their previous dog food.  It even looks better than some of the other dog foods I have given them in the past.<br /><br />If you aren't a stickler for ingredients, then this would make a good choice for already healthy dogs.  Mine enjoyed it and are currently on their last bowl of it.<br /><br />The one thing that I don't like about it is the price.  It is a little high for the package size and other brands will give you more for the same price."
1,"The Grilled Sirloin flavor was a winner for my dogs!  It was given mixed with their regular food to enhance and the whole 4.5 pound bag didn't last two days!  The first ingredient listed is beef, then soy products, corn product and poultry..then a lot of supplements like Vitamin E, Calcium, etc.  This Sirloin Steak flavored food also featured potato and green bean on the label and sure enough, was listed in the ingredients as real components.  I will use this as enrichment since I have so many dogs and it is a bit pricey.  Good product!"
1,"This bagged dry dog food ""presents"" very nicely . . . no disagreeable dog food odor, visible chewy meat and vegetable nuggets, and apparently an excellent taste that dogs enjoy.<br /><br />We normally feed our Jack Russell and Chihuahua using a feeder that allows them access to food 24/7.  However, with this Chef Michael's Grilled Siroin Dry Dog Food, I'm forced to ration it out in suitable serving sizes to each dog to prevent overeating (the same routine I would use for table scraps).  Notwithstanding the overfeeding caution, I trust Purina (the maker of Chef Michael's) as a reputable pet food manufacturer and have no concerns with nutritional or health issues here.  Combine that with the apparent great taste and this is a 5 star product in my opinion.<br /><br />If I may add further opinion regarding the quality of this product and the variety of reviewer responses -- I see that many reviewers took issue with the ingredients list, finding most of the ingredients to be inferior, undesirable, or harmful.  I guess I'm a bit more economically frugal in my views.  As this is a relatively expensive dog food, I don't mean frugal price-wise, but rather resource-wise.  OF COURSE by-product meats and some vegetable filler (which does have nutritional benefit) are used.  I find it acceptable and even expected that the meat and fat products used in this DOG FOOD would come from animals that are in-part legally unsuitable for humans  (although in other parts of the world they would be consumed by humans). In fact, nothing in the animal slaughter industry goes to waste and the ingredients in this pet food product are far from the bottom of that usage ladder.  Unacceptable are the synthetic pet food products such as we have imported from China that have actually killed our pets or ruined their kidneys.  Acceptable, in my opinion, are pet foods (such as this Chef Michael's branded product) made by a reputable experienced manufacturer using by-products and vegetable products known as suitable for pets.<br /><br />Anecdotally, I recall growing up on a farm where our Labrador loved to kill and eat groundhogs . . . it sometimes took a few days to finish one . . . in the summer.  Burying didn't help, as she would dig them up.  Anyway,  the dog loved the disgusting decaying groundhogs, which would have violated pet food laws and sensitivities on many fronts.  She lived long and healthy.  And happy."
1,"Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavored dog food has been my choice of dog food for quite some time.  I used to feed both of my dogs the same food, but when my smaller one developed seizure activity I decided to change.  One of the things I liked about this particular brand is that it doesn't have any ""suspect"" ingredients such as rosemary extract which have been rumored to exacerbate such activity in small dogs.  No, he has not been cured, but with anti-seizure medication and a food sans ""natural"" ingredients I feel more comfortable with his diet.<br /><br />When I went to the store to select his new food I stood in the dog food aisle for a long time and read every single dry dog food label in the store.  Chef Michael's was the one of choice.  One other thing I liked that the FIRST ingredient was beef.  Dogs are carnivores and need the protein.  I could do without the added color, but that obviously makes people feel better.  The food is loaded with tender pieces of beef and my dog loves the taste.<br /><br />My dog is small and this food lasts for quite a while.  If you want to keep it fresh, you might also want to add a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A6UF4U"">Gamma Vittles Vault Plus</a> container to your order.  I do have to cut up some of the ""tender pieces"" as they are large. These pieces also make great treats for my larger dog, who can often be found begging for one when I'm preparing their meals.  All in all my satisfaction factor is very high ... and Liam loves it too!<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, ground yellow corn, glycerin, poultry by-product meal, ground wheat, animal digest, pearled barley, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, salt, grilled sirloin steak flavor, dried green beans, dried potatoes, sulfur, Vitamin E supplement, choline chloride, zinc sulfate, ferrous sulfate, added color (Red 40, Blue 2, Yellow 5, Yellow 6), niacin, wheat flour, potassium chloride, L-Lysine monohydrochloride, manganese sulfate, Vitamin A supplement, calcium pantothenate, thiamine mononitrate, copper sulfate, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin B-12 supplement, pyridoxine hydrochloride, garlic oil, Vitamin D-3 supplement, folic acid, calcium iodate, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), biotin, sodium selenite.

1,"Lexie is a picky eater and does not like most dog food or most treats.  But she loves Chef Michael's.  We discovered this brand about a year ago, and were astounded at how much better she ate than with other brands.  The Grilled Sirloin flavor is new to us, and she likes it just as much as the chicken flavor she'd been eating."
1,"****<br /><br />When my six-year-old, seventy-pound dog, PheyeG'hdeaux, hears me opening his usual bag of Eukanuba he does wander over after a while and watch me till I've dumped several pounds into his giant feeding tub, and then he does typically aimlessly meander over to it and sniff it and eat some.  I think he's just checking to make sure I haven't added a live squirrel or a robin, both of which he's 100% sure he can catch out in the wild if he tries just a little bit harder, which he always does but which never quite works.<br /><br />But shortly after I opened the bag of this product, Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food 4.5 Pound Bag, PheyeG'hdeaux not only RAN to the kitchen, he actively sniffed up a veritable storm as I walked a few steps here and a few steps there preparing to present him with the food that so tickled his extraordinarily sensitive olfactory palate.  He snarfed, if I'm using that term correctly, down several bites more than he would snarf up of Eukanuba, which tells me there's something special about this dog food.  I think -- and I admit I'm just guessing here -- that the Purina people have somehow managed to synthesize a special molecule or compound whose only purpose is to appeal to a dog's taste buds and smell neurons, and they've added it to the product under review.  If your dog is a picky eater, this might be a good choice.<br /><br />In any case it's important to consider not only taste and texture but healthfulness.  In order to test the nutritional value of Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food 4.5 Pound Bag I myself went ahead and ate it exclusively for three days, and now that I'm conscious again I can report the results.<br /><br />First, second and third, it tastes awful.  I realize it might taste really good to a dog, especially if that dog usually eats Eukauba (but see my review of June 7, 2012, of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ0B0I"">PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound</a>) for years at a time with only the rarest of desserts of bunny carcass or cat poop, but as a human I can tell you here and now, without any doubt, that this product tastes awful not just after a few days, not just after a few bites, but after a few chews of the first bite.  There are different shaped bits and they are different colors, but no matter which bit you choose it will turn out to be dreadful shortly after you bite into it.  You try the first bit and it's nasty from the first chew to the last swallow.  Hopefully you try a second shape of bit, but it turns out to be even worse.  Still hopefully, you try a third shape or a different color, and it proves to be yet even more dreadfully awful-tasting.<br /><br />As I say, I ate nothing but Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food 4.5 Pound Bag for three days, and at this time I also wish to report that my bone marrow has turned green, which the many doctors who've attended to me since this morning when I had to take myself to the emergency room because of several unusual and quite alarming alarming symptoms say is not just uncommom but downright unprecedented.  Also, they say my blood tests indicate I'm pregnant, which is a whole new problem since, as you know from previous Amazon reviews, I'm still a virgin.  I'll keep you updated, because I think we might have something here.<br /><br />****<br /><br />I subtract one star because the bag is not nearly as handy as the Beneful one.  It's not as tough, and it has no opener or closer.<br /><br />In case you didn't click to read my review at http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BESE8R6UU51I/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001VJ0B0I&nodeID=&tag=&linkCode=of the Beneful product, you probably should if you're ever going to get another dog or cat.  Go to the section titled AD LIB FEEDING.  Also, note that I have updated the list from seven pets to eight."
1,"Since my friend is into rescue work, I figured this dog food would be great to test on her two dogs and the five shelter dogs she is working with.  All the dogs ate this food eagerly and they were not starving dogs; so I'd say it gets five stars for taste.<br /><br />According to the packaging, Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food is 100% Complete and Balanced for adult dogs with 23 essential vitamins. Since dogs are carnivores, meat should be high on the ingredient list and the first four ingredients in order are beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (from of Vitamin E).<br /><br />Each serving contains:<br />Crude Protein 28%<br />Crude Fat 16%<br />Crude Fiber 3%<br />Moisture 12 %<br /><br />Overall, the dogs loved it and since the food states it is 100% complete and balanced and the first ingredient is beef, I give this five stars.  From the dogs point of view, it appears to be delicious."
1,Chef Micheals Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food Rocks !! It s catnip for dogs . I have two shitzus they won't stop eating it. I usually feed them Imes but they seem to like this much better.It does'nt seem like the pieces are too large because they are chowin' down.It must be the sirloin flavor .Anyway if you have finicky dogs they will probably like it. I would give it a try.
0,"So its been a week since I let my dogs ""try"" this food. We have 4 dogs so this bag went quick! 3 Small dogs, Shih Tzu and Maltese's and One Yellow Lab, all adults.<br /><br />The product states how tender the pieces are and how your dog will love it... and that they do... It also says theres no artificial perservatives and that the #1 ingredient is the beef that your dog wants.. but... is this what your dog needs???<br /><br />Just because the product looks good and colorful and says your dog wants it doesn't mean its good for him. This was more like a treat for my dogs then ""food"" and even then a very unhealthy treat. There is a ton of soy and corn in this food and by products. I think the colored bites are more to please the humans then the dogs! That means there are aritifial preservatives or flavors or colors of some sort to get the colors. Does a dog really need this? but mainly is it healthy.... For a 4.5lb bag of unhealthy food it is pricy too.<br /><br />You are what you eat... and if you give your dog a healthy food with NO byproducts and no corn etc.. your dog will be alot more healthy (and less gassy if gas is a factor) I'd recommend trying good healthy food for a week or two if your not already, you will see a difference and there are a bunch out there on the market. Yes they are more costly.. but think of the benifits as well. Why give your dog stuff thats unhealthy? Can lead to problems... and more bills.<br /><br />I don't recommend this food, and my dogs enjoyed their short treat while it lasted. We didn't fully finish the bag either as after a few days I didn't want to keep giving them ""junk food"""
0,"I picked this up on a whim. My thought was to uses a very small amount as a sort of snack for my dog before bed.<br />I do this with my cats, too. I give them each a very small amount of a dry cat food that is low on the nutrition scale,<br />but high on the cat  junk food scale. I had been giving my dog an oatmeal biscuit or two each night. When I saw this<br />I thought I would try it and give him the same sort of treat as I do the cats.<br /><br />First of all, he loves it. He practically kisses my feet when I give it to him. It has an odd texture, in my opinion. Sort<br />of similar to a handful of raisins, not quite dry but? And Duncan gobbles it up and clearly wishes for more. I have a<br />fairly spoiled dog. Due to health issues, I cook for him every week. He eats cooked fish, beef or chicken with rice or pasta<br />peas, and some supplements. So if I ever do give him dog food in any quantity at all, it is a very high quality, not so yummy<br />as this ( apparently) dog food. So I am very concerned with what is in the food he is given. I see no problem with a tablespoon<br />or two a night for my 70lb dog, but I would not feed this as his sole diet. The nutrition value is very low, which is usually the<br />way it is with the food dogs like best.<br /><br />So, I really wanted to give this a higher rating since he likes it so much, but since I am writing this for dog people who are<br />surely interested in keeping their dogs healthy as well as happy, I had to go with two stars. Now, as a treat, or an occasional<br />meal, I see no problem with this. Dogs enjoy junk food, too."
0,"The rating is one star because the dog liked it a lot and one star in thanks for the Vine program which allows us to try products without spending good money on them.<br /><br />My dog is 130 Mastiff and he did not like or eat the Beneful dog food that we reviewed a few months ago. Not so with this bag. He was interested in the smell as soon as I opened the bag and ate the whole bowl when it was placed in front of him. He is not a dog who is normally interested in food. He doesn't beg at the table, shows no interest in scraps and usually has to have wet food mixed in with the dry before he will eat. His preferred diet is couches, dog beds, remotes, eyeglasses, and a 9"" ratchet wrench. Yet he likes this food. I wonder what the attraction is , since he usually shuns table scrap meats.<br /><br />In spite of the fancy name, the colorful textured kibble, the grilled sirloin label, this bag is full of stuff that is not good for dogs as a daily diet. Too much soy, soy products, artificial colors, etc.<br /><br />We will be using this bag as a training treat, because he seems to like the taste, but we are still on a hunt for real, unadulterated, healthy food."
0,"We have three dogs.  One will eat anything, one will eat almost anything, and one is a picky eater.  Fortunately, the picky eater is the chihuahua.  Part of the picky eating comes from his sensitive stomach, and we avoid chicken and turkey because that consistently upsets his stomach.<br /><br />The first time he was offered Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin dog food, he devoured it with pleasure, and I was ecstatic to have a dry food that got some enthusiasm.  Unfortunately, that enthusiasm was gone by the next day, and he absolutely refused to eat it for two days.  We gave up.  If he'd rather eat the big dogs' food than eat his premium food, there is no  point in spending extra for a more expensive food.<br /><br />From my point of view, the ""premium"" seemed to be mostly the ""Chef Michael"" name, as it didn't seem to have any better ingredients than the other Purina foods.  Beef was the first ingredient, but it was followed by soy meal and soy flour. (Can we say GMO?) It also contained chicken by products (a long ways under the soy products, by the way.)  Even salt appears before green beans and potatoes.  It is cuter than regular kibble, but I don't think the dogs care.  It also has varying textures, but once again, even when I let the big dogs try it, they weren't overly impressed.<br /><br />My opinion is that either spend more and get real premium food or save your money (unless you want attractive kibble) and just buy a standard dog food."
1,"It took about ten seconds to realize that this product tastes great to my dogs.  We have a lab and a pug, and both of them attacked their bowls like I'd given them steak.  I'm sure they weren't happy when I went back to ""boring"" Hill's the following day, but this isn't a product I'd recommend for keeping any dog healthy.<br /><br />The reason I've only given this product four stars is that many of the ingredients aren't something I want my dogs eating regularly.  They don't have many problems with soy, but I know a lot of other dogs do.  They (and I) do have problems with the heavy use of corn, the always-worrisome chicken by-product, and artificial colors.  That last one seems like an obvious admission from the makers of this product that they're really targeting dog owners more than they are dogs.  My lab certainly wasn't awestruck by the various colors on the package.<br /><br />My feeling is that this is a nice treat or occasional meal-topper for my dogs, but it won't be something I purchase for daily consumption.  Both dogs certainly love the taste, and I commend Chef Michael for that, but for long-term health I'd recommend other options."
0,"The picture on the bag of the food looks really healthy. One can only assume by the name they are trying to push a better food product for our beloved pets.I mean Chef Michael's? How can someone not buy it? It has to be great!<br /><br />My dog ate it quickly, but then again, my dog isn't a picky eater.<br /><br />I had a bag of Blue Buffalo. I try to feed my dog better food. Here are the list of the first few ingredients: deboned chicken, chicken meal, whole ground brown rice, whole ground barley, oatmeal.... etc. etc.<br /><br />This is what is in the Chef Michael's: beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with mixed tochpherols(eh whats that?) brewers rice, soy protein concentrate etc. etc.<br /><br />As you can see there is a big difference. While the food looks decent. Its softer. The brown stuff looks like meat. And it has bits of yellow/brown and green hard nuggets.<br /><br />While your dog will probably eat it, I'd say spend the extra 4 bucks and get a bag of something better. Its $13.87 in the store for a for a 4.5 pound bag.  I think I paid $17.00 for a 6 pound bag of BB. Or something a little healthier.<br /><br />Bottom line is that each pet owner must choose what they think is best for their four legged buddy."
0,"Beef might be listed as the first ingredient but that hardly makes it the main ingredient.  After reading the ingredients list this ""food"" seems to be mostly made up of various forms of soy.  I am not a fan of soy & with all the GMO crap being pushed on us, I like it even less.<br /><br />Upon presenting this artificially flavored & dyed product to my fur babies, they started to eat up.  But then one by one they stopped & looked at me as if to say, ""What is this crap?  We don't want this.  Where's the stuff you normally give us?""  I left the food for them.  Several hours later, the food was still in the bowl & a disgusting explosion of black runny vomit was all over everything.  Jerk that I am, I continued to try to get them to eat it.  After all, I have a review to do - that's how I ended up with the food in the first place.  After several days I gave up.  One of my babies simply stopped eating.  That was the final straw.  I am not torturing my pets any longer.  They are back on their usual grub. No more black vomit.  Everyone is once again eating until the bowls are empty & my furbabies are back to their joyful behavior."
1,"This dog food is amazing it even smells good. Since the pieces are good size I decided to use these as rewards when our dog Sadie successfully completes a trick. Its a very effective reward and she really seems to enjoy the taste,using the product in this way is also cost effective since its not exactly cheep. I would recommend this product to dog owners, especially for training purposes!"
1,"Not sure what other criteria exists to judge dry dog food -- the shapes look like pieces of meat?<br /><br />Seriously, my two dogs ate this willingly and even returned for seconds."
0,"I may want to live on caramel and ice cream, butterfingers and apple pie - but after a few months of this diet, I'd be an overweight diabetic. This dog food, even though the name sounds (lets use the thesaurus here) resplendent, delightful, and even pulchritudinous (!) - is canine candy. I mean, come on - ""Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin""? Sounds like something I'd want to eat. But read further, and it's ""sirloin flavored"" and is full of corn and other fillers.  Sure, the way my dog devoured this looked like I had not fed him in days - he was ready to lick the chrome off the bowl. ""Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin"" is a name dreamed up by the marketing department.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the food is flavor and filler, low quality protein, and high in carbs/calories.  If your dog is a lay-about, couch potato, indoor pooch - this stuff is better as a mix-in for finicky eaters, or as an occasional treat. A dog will have to be pretty active to burn off the calories if this was his/her staple.<br /><br />A week later? The dog won't touch it. Just nuzzles the stuff and gives it a tentative lick. Guess he wizened up!"
1,"Unfortunately he can't write the review!<br />Whenever you switch dog food on a dog they will be all excited the first time. Discovering something new in their bowl , scarfing up how ever much you give them; and then the newness goes away. A few servings and they seem tired of the taste.<br />Not so with this Chef Michael's product. Until the bag was empty , our dog looked forward to his morning feeding with great anticipation.<br />Usually the dog is in our bedroom waiting for us to get up...three of the last four days he has been sitting by his bowl.Think he likes it"
0,"My dog loved this food. He scarfed it down and wanted more. However, when I looked at the ingredients, I was disappointed. Lots of soybean meal and soy flour, and corn meal. Is it really so hard to make dog food that's not full of this stuff? When I buy Purina, I'm expecting something that is actually good for my dog as well as delicious. A definite let-down."
1,"Opening the bag I noticed there's no zip to reseal.  It would be helpful if there was even a zip closure. I had to put the bag up high because I was worried about my dog food loving cat getting in it - she was all over it. It smells like people food to me, it's got a smell that is a lot like steak.<br /><br />My dog eagerly ate it, even though he really shouldn't have been all that hungry.  His first taste of this was after he'd already ate his regular food.  He seemed to really enjoy it and he ate it all.  He can be picky about food and is one to turn his nose up at a lot of the healthier dog foods.  He's also the type that will leave kibble in the bowl of a certain type in a combo if he doesn't like just that type - but he ate all of this.  There wasn't a chunk left in his bowl.<br /><br />The ingredient list is subpar though so I can't give it 5 starts- it has corn and soy both, and it is probably filled with GMOs.  The rest looks like it is mostly animal byproducts and flavor enhancers.  For the price I'd expect it to be a bit better.  My dog has not had any gas issues or allergic reactions though - he is allergic to a fleas and who knows what else but this has not bothered him."
1,"I was surprised watching out two Huskies eating Chef Michael's creation and then asking for more because they would not normally eat bagged, dry dog food unless hungry. This may be a first because, as it's probably the case with most dogs, they would rather eat human food then dog food and if human food wasn't available they'd first go for some fresh 'rabbit' or 'field mouse' if they could catch any.<br /><br />I haven't tasted the food myself but our dogs seem to find it delicious. As for its nutritious qualities, the number one listed ingredient is 'beef' so it appears to be so. There is some text on the bag claiming that there are vitamins and minerals that would give the dog a shiny coat but that's probably speculation. I don't know of anything that I could eat and make my hair turn shiny so I can't see how such a miracle food ingredient could exist for dogs. If you want your dogs to have a shiny coat, there's shampoo.<br /><br />The food appears to smell good too and it comes in a variety of bits, some soft, some crunchy. The bits come in different colors but that's probably something that we humans are more likely to notice or appreciate because dogs' vision is believed to be either black and white or something close to an old 50's color TV.<br /><br />Since this is the first 'from the bag' food other than Milk Bone that our dogs actually love, it gets a well-deserved five star rating."
1,"This dog food has beef as the #1 product ingredient as well as 23 essential vitamins and minerals.  Yet that isn't good enough for a lot of people out there.  Yes it has soy and corn in it.  Oh well.  Dogs will eat it up.  Who cares from what part this by-product comes from?  Dogs are scavengers folks, just check Wikipedia.  Some use this product as a dog treat -- great idea.  I suppose if you have a show dog this dog food will not be good enough for you, but what did you expect for this price?  The only think that really bothers me about this product is the food coloring added.  Is that for the dog owner or the dog?  I just can't see the dog really caring about the color of the food.  The dog bag is a thicker plastic sealed extremely well so this food is going to be air tight.  I'm not a big fan that I have to use scissors to open it however."
1,"This Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food loved by the retriever puppy we tested it on, but I do have concerns with the content. This puppy will eat just about anything put in front of her, intended or not, but she absolutely devoured this stuff.<br /><br />The issue is that it has a lot of soy, corn, and rice, and unidentified animal fat high on the ingredient list. It does have beef listed as the first ingredient, which is probably why Sissy loves it so much. I am not sure that it isn't ""good enough"", but this will not be our dog food of choice and it will be given as a treat on occasion.<br /><br />Recommended, with the caveats above.<br /><br />CFH"
1,"I'm going to have to defer to my 6-year old Wheaten Terrier regarding this Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin kibble and he gives it five big sniffs.<br /><br />My dog, like many others, is highly allergic so I'm careful to make certain that the first ingredient listed is not wheat and/or corn.  And, most importantly, with all the dog food scares from food made in China and distributed by US companies, I make certain that it is both manufactured AND distributed in the USA.  This product met my requirements and my dog's appetite and my reward was a slobbering kiss."
0,"Chef Michael might be a fictional character in the same vein as Aunt Jemima and the Keebler Elves, but that doesn't excuse him from putting some truly nasty ingredients into his Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food. So many other reviewers have pointed out the list of dubious ingredients that it doesn't pay to duplicate them again, but I urge you to take a long, hard look at that list before you commit to purchasing this item.<br /><br />Nutrition aside, this is a very tasty food item based on my dogs' response to finding it in their bowl. Frankly, they went bonkers over Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food. I'm probably not going to make this part of their regular diet, but I will continue using it as a treat."
1,"I have a beagle who is a pretty picky eater (weird for a Beagle, but she's kind of a diva).  So I thought she might turn her nose up at this food, but I was totally wrong! She LOVES it-we did mix it with her normal Pedigree food so that she didn't get a sick stomach from an immediate switch, and I would recommend doing that if you're switching b/c this food is much more rich and fresh than normal dry dog foods.  The ingredient list includes A LOT of added vitamins (D-3, B-12, E, K) which is better than the Pedigree I normally feed her. It is dry, which is great b/c it keeps for a long time and requires no prep other than just tossing it in the bowl! It is considered a premium dog food, so that does make it more expensive, but it's a great treat that is good for my dog and she loves it too!"
1,"I've never seen my dogs go as crazy over a dog food as when I gave this to them.  They absolutely love it.  The food looks just like it does on the bag, with pieces that are supposed to be beef that look like shredded beef and then little round balls that are supposed to be potatoes and green beans.  The potatoes and green beans are a little under 1/2 inch, but the beef pieces are closer to 3/4 to 1 inch, so this food might be best for a bigger dog.  The smell of the food is not as strong as some other dog foods we've purchased, but it definitely must have a good flavor.  It's made by Purina, which has been around forever, so I think it's a product we can feel safe using."
0,"While other dogs may perceive this dog food as delish, my Yorkie says no. Why?  I cannot know with certainty, but I suspect that she resists any dog food with corn as an ingredient.  Perhaps she smelled something she does not like, but she walked away, letting me know that this was not a treat.  It remains in her bowl, hours after offering it to her.<br /><br />It's back to the super expensive stuff. . . and the cooked chicken.  Spoiled dog?  Sure, but she's a healthy dog!"
0,If this is a snack it looks like it. The pieces remind me of cheese puffs. Their texture is puffy and it was hard for my dog to chew and swallow. The smell was appetizing even to us humans but my dog was actually scared of it after several attempts to swallow it. It has no weight and only puffed up space so it obviously has no nutritional value.
1,I'll keep this short as others have given long descriptions of the product.  Chef Michael's is pricey but I have a very pickey eater & she likes it.
1,It's true.  I've never seen him want food that wasn't in my kids happy meals more than this.  He even whined for more after his bowl was empty.  This stuff is great for at least one dog!
1,"I have two small dogs who are very picky eaters and they like this dry dog food. They don't like many dry dog foods, but they will eat this one, especially when it's mixed with some canned dog food. They like the beef flavors of the Chef Michael's canned food, so I'm assuming this dry food must have some of the same flavors. I noticed the larger pieces of food, which appear to be those that are the beef-flavored bites, get eaten first. They do eventually finish all of the food, which with my picky eaters is something to celebrate."
1,"I just recently moved back in with my parents. My little one is still a puppy and on puppy food, I tested it out on my parents dogs which are both adults. Since it seemed like a nice healthy choice, since my parents usually give their two chihuahuas dry food topped with a package of moist food on top. They grazed at this and didn't really finish it till their favorite part of the meal (the package of moist food) was added to the top. It is a healthy food, and just because my parents dog was not totally find it their favorite, doesn't mean all dogs will not like it. It is just not something that I will be buying on a regular basis."
1,"My dog is spoiled. She was a rescue, but I think she forgets this. When I buy her food with crunchy dog food and soft pieces mixed up, she typically only eats the the soft pieces. And when there are both red and yellow soft dog pieces, she picks out the yellow pieces first. So, due to my dog's finicky eating habits, I did not have much hope that this dog food would impress her. Still, I try to expose her to different dog foods in hopes she will like one. We've tried quite a few varieties and I always end up giving unfinished bags to my neighbors to give to their pets.  This bag, however, will finally be finished.  My dogs loves the little steak pieces.  As a senior dog, the ability for her to easily eat the food is important and it was my perception that she was able to eat this food easily -- she ate both the moist pieces and the kibble."
1,"I am not sure if the hype about this ""gourmet"" dog food is for the dogs or the owners (and I expect its the latter), but Purina has come up with a great product that the dogs really enjoy, without sacrificing any of the nutrition necessary for maintaining good canine health. Both my beloved pets and myself can recommend this food."
1,"The 4-legged critics on my taste panel are 3 hardened street dogs who usually eat anything. Yet, they will turn up their noses at something if they don't like it. They liked this. These are rescue dogs and need fattening up. Fillers in a gourmet dog food will do nicely."
1,My dog approved this in no time and he is super picky about his food.it is very good quality and he loves it.
1,"I currently use an upscale dog food, dry kibble with no grain, all meat and sweet potatoes. My dog likes it but gets sick of it unless I embellish it. So I was intrigued by Amazon's offer for me to try Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin. I decided not to replace my dog food with Chef Michael's but to use it as an enhancer and as a snack food.<br /><br />Bottom-line: My dog Gretchen loves Chef Michael's, both its strong steak smell and its taste. I decided not to do a total replacement in part because Chef Michael's has soy and corn ingredients and while I'm no expert I've read that these aren't prized ingredients in a top dog food. Let me say, though, that I don't know this as fact. This is just what people in the ""dog community"" tell me.<br /><br />However, if push came to shove and my picky dog would only eat Chef Michael's, I'd use it. For me what the dog eats is a huge factor. So if your dog doesn't have soy and/or corn allergies, you might give Chef Michael's a try."
1,"I've got to say this is the ONLY dog food my dog has ever tried and wanted more AND I don't have to doctor it up with shredded cheddar cheese or leftovers or anything else.  She just devours it!  I don't know how to recommend this any higher than that.<br /><br />I know it's a tad bit more expensive than some other Purina foods, but it's well worth the money.  I will be purchasing Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food again, and again, and again!<br /><br />Thank you Purina!!!"
1,"This is what I can tell you - my dog loves almost all of the food she eats, sneaks or straight out steals (she is a rescue dog with food issues). I cannot honestly tell you anything about this food (not having tried it myself) except that my dog loves it and snarfs it down.<br /><br />After looking at it on the package and than in the bowl my wife did make the comment that this dog food looks better than a lot of the stews and casseroles we have eaten."
1,"This part of the review is being provided by a cairn terrier -- her owner is just transcribing the notes. The terrier says: I have never been that crazy about dry dog food, especially when it's compared to that great mushy stuff that comes out of a can. But this smelled and tasted so good that I pounced on it immediately and scarfed it right up. And begged for more. It tastes like meat, so I guess it is.<br /><br />From Divascribe: I was surprised at how quickly my dog took to this food -- she's never been particularly enthusiastic about dry food before. But the bag says ""Real beef is the #1 ingredient."" I looked at the ingredient list, and beef is listed first. There's a long, long list of other ingredients, some of which don't sound that appetizing (poultry byproduct meal), but unfortunately that's the case with most dog food. It has a nice, beefy scent that got my dog to stick her head in the bowl. My only concern is that, because I have an older dog, this might be a bit rich for her. So I plan to mix it in with her regular dry dog food for a while. No problems so far, though, and one very happy dog."
1,"Our 4 year old mutt is loving this hearty dry dog food!  We had always been fans of the Chef Michael's wet canned food, giving it to our healthy dog since she was a year old.  But this new dry food is a great addition with thick, tasty chunks and nutritious ingredients.  The combination of veggies and meat make for a well balanced meal.  We don't add water to make it juicy since our dog loves sinking her teeth into the crunchy pieces, but for an occasional variation the added water mixes a nice soupy texture.  One thing I particularly like is that the food doesn't stink really badly like other commercially prepared pet foods.  An affordable, healthy choice for your pup."
1,"We feed our black lab in the IQ treat ball (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ARUKTG/). There are always a few final bits he would leave in it, but when we tried this Grilled Sirloin dry food, he would bring the ball to me to try and get even the final bits out! So it must taste pretty good. The beef pieces are a bit -odd shaped and might get stuck in those treat ball holes, but otherwise, it's fine.<br /><br />The daily feeding recommendations are 1 cup per 10lb body weight which seems a bit high for beef-containing dog food. For a 50 lb dog, the 4.5 lb bag might last for ~ a week (One cup of this food is ~70-75g)."
1,"I'm slowly weaning my puppy off Puppy Chow, so I've been adding Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin dry food to his dry food. Pooper, my puppy, is a picky eater and he loves to steal cat food and he will hardly eat dry food unless I mix wet food into it. Though, he will eat this dog food without any wet food added to it. This dry food actually smells good even to me. My cats even tried to steal a piece of this dry food.<br /><br />I have 4 dogs, 3 outside my husband's coonhounds and my one inside dog,Pooper, who is a lovable mutt who is 1/2 German Shepard, 1/4 Boxer and 1/4 Cocker Spaniel. I will continue to buy this dog food for my inside dog. Though, it's too pricy on my budget to feed all of my dogs.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this for any picky dog. My picky Pooper loves it."
1,"It's dog food, so I really have to take Maggie's word for it.  She eats it, she doesn't seem to get tired of it, she even does a sort of doggie buffet where she grabs a mouthful, takes it a couple feet away from the bowl and puts down a line of the dog food then eats it.  I won't guarantee that your dog will do the buffet thing - she's a bit peculiar. Anyway, Maggie gives it 5 stars."
1,"I always read the ingredient labels on my food to avoid product preservatives like sodium benzoate.  Any food for my dog needs to meet the same standards.  Costco's Kirkland branded dog foods have met my budget needs as well as provided quality nourishment.  Was Chef Michael's quality enough for me to shell out twice the price?  No.  But then again, I'm cheap and I know it.<br /><br />I personally dont have a problem with grains and soy.  I grew up on the same ingredients in mom's cooking.  And if it's good enough foe me, it's good enough for my dog.  As long as my dogs likes the taste and receives the essential nutrients he needs, mission accomplished."
1,"I have a dog that can be rather picky about his dog food as he much prefers to eat the human food with our dinner.  Because of his tendency to develop weight problems, we really try to discourage that and keep him on dog food.<br /><br />He loved this food and I had no problem getting him to accept a bowl of this happily instead of incessantly begging to share our dinner.  I was quite satisfied and will definitely be purchasing this product for future use."
1,"I generally don't give my dog food with corn or other grains because dogs are not supposed to eat them! I actually didn't realize that this food had corn until it arrived, I didn't read the list of ingredients carefully and since it wasn't the first ingredient, I was excited and quickly made the order.<br /><br />My dog usually eats high quality food - either all natural foods or home made meals consisting of raw meats and vegetables. She loved this food, and ate it right away. She doesn't do that with typical dog foods unless she's really hungry so I think she enjoyed the taste. 4 stars was because it has grains in it - AND SOY!!"
1,"Our dog loved this food.  He does like most food, but he really seemed to get excited about this stuff.  It was his first adult dog food after puppy food.  He actually seemed to get a bit thin on it at times, maybe because it doesn't pack down and I was feeding him a bit less than I thought I was.  His stool seemed very healthy while on this food.  It's a good product."
1,"Sometimes I feel sorry for our dogs having to eat the same kibble every day. We can tell that they also hate having the same stuff every day. One of the worst problems for a dog owner is getting them to eat once they become disenchanted with their fare. The problem s that once we lose them, they stay lost. But with this dry food they take an interest and dinnertime becomes competitive once agin as everyone tries to glom the kibble so as to deny the other a good meal. And we'd rather see that than watch them ignore their food altogether."
1,"My dogs, a jack russell and chihuahua, like this dry food,  the jack russell loves eating most of the soft meaty bits first then eats the crunchy veggie bits.  The chihuahua prefers the soft meaty bits and will nibble on the crunchy veggie bits last.  I can also use both the soft and crunchy bits as training treats for the dogs.  Chef Michael's dog food also has a nice aroma, quite organic and does not smell arificial and funky like some dog food, just smells natural.  There is also a lot of natural and healthy ingredients with the food.  I would definitely buy this for my dogs again."
1,"I'm not entirely sure if I can give an objective review for this product. Why? Well, unlike me, my dog is not a picky eater. He'll eat anything we give to him, including carrots and the occasional licking of a yogurt spoon. I think his voracious appetite was passed on to him by his predecessor, who once ate a pound of cheddar cheese my mother and I naively placed on our kitchen counter before going out to run a few errands.<br /><br />So for that reason, I don't think my review is going to be all that helpful for those considering buying this product. My dog was on another brand of dog chow, but we slowly began the transition from his food to this product. When James is usually fed breakfast, lunch, or dinner, he eats it pretty fast. But once he was fully on Chef Michael's dog chow, James inhaled his meals. I have never seen my dog eat his food so fast.<br /><br />So I guess it was a hit, after all!"
1,"My dogs liked the previous flavors (chicken, etc.) so I was enthused to try this new flavor.  My dogs seemed to liked this even better than the chicken.  Not sure what more to say about it since I am only able to see a visual response.  Appears to be a good, premium, slightly expensive dry dog food."
1,"This didn't last long. The amount of food was fairly generous,but my dogs really loved it! My only complaint is my 3 three dogs liked it too much and I would be purchasing more very soon. In the future We'll mix it in with their regular food as a treat rather than a meal just so it would last. As a footnote, one of our dogs was off her feed for awhile,but this snapped her out of it."
1,"I must confess to having two of the pickiest eaters on the planet.  Granted, there are plenty of websites toting that Chef Michael's is not the best food for the pooches.  I scanned the ingredients and saw that, yeah, that may be true.  However, we live a very active lifestyle (to stay trim and slim) and this is a food that they devour nearly before the bowl hits the floor.  Amazing.  Pedigree?  Not so much.  Purina?  Nada.  Blue?  Yeah, right.<br />With Chef Michael's, I actually garnish their bowls with fresh steamed brocoli and they adore it.  Highly recommended as a food solution."
1,"My two senior dogs are very picky eaters, they even turn down some treats! When dog food was tainted and recalled a few years ago I switched my male cockapoo and female cairn terrier to a fresh cooked diet from a pet ""deli.""  It is expensive and an hour from my home but they have remained on this diet because every time I tried to change back they went on hunger strikes.  I have been incoorporating Michael's dog food into their diets slowly over the past few weeks and they both have been eating every morsel.  These dogs hae been offered no less than six other brands of dog food in the past and usually they just walk away from their dishes. I finally told my family to remind me next time I complain about their food price that they will not switch and just bite the time and money bullet to keep them on the deli diet. I ordered a sample bag from the Vine review program and I am so happy to report the dog reviewers really like it. Just remember to introduce a new food gradually to ease the stress on any dog's digestive track."
1,"Our Jack Russell is used to her controlled diet, but we sometime like to give her a handful of treats here and there. This 5 lb bag is loaded with chewy, and mixed food that she goes crazy for, and we use as a supplement for being good (watching a dog nose away the old food for this is something funny to see).<br /><br />Terrific, balanced dietary food that has the feel and texture of premium food and is a superb product. Saw it on shelf at Target; got it here, really pleased with it.  Chef Michael's is very, very good!"
1,"This dog food has made my dog very happy.  I have been using a quality dog food before trying the Chef Michael's, and he liked it just fine, but would eat the chewy pieces first and sometimes the dry pieces would sit for a while before he would finally eat them.  With Chef Michael's dog food, he not only eats the chewy pieces, but also the crunchy potato and green bean kibble.  It even smells better than other dog foods and I feel pretty good about feeding him something he enjoys so much.<br /><br />Beef is the first ingredient listed, which is great, and unlike some dog foods where corn is the first ingredient, corn is the 7th ingredient listed.  Also listed as ingredients are 23 minerals and vitamins, including Vitamins E, B-12, and D, folic acid, niacin, calcium, manganese, potassium and lysine.  However, it also contains a few strange ingredients such as ""animal digest"", and it has a lot of ""meals"" and ""flours"" in it. I do not know if they are optimum for dogs or are just used as fillers.<br /><br />Pricewise, it compares nicely to Purina One and Beneful, which I have also fed my dog."
1,"My two little yorkies are finicky pups.  They'll eat something when it's new, but a week later turn their noses up at it.  It's been a month now and they're still eating it.<br /><br />When I first opened the package, they didn't exactly jump for joy.  In fact, they backed away from it.  I held one of the pieces out to them and they seemed very disinterested.  I was thinking for a minute there they weren't going to eat it at all.  And, this is a very big bag of dog food for two little dogs.  However, when I put it in their dish they started eating right away.  Because the pieces are rather large for small dogs, they can only eat one piece at a time.  The food seems to be a bit chewy, so it takes a while to eat one piece.  There's no real oder that I can smell, but because it doesn't smell like Pupa-roni they aren't fighting over it."
1,"If they're picky eaters dogs may care about the size, shape, texture, smell, and/or taste of a food; or, if they're like my dog, they care that it stays still long enough that they can gobble it down.  Owners should care about calorie content, that the food is intended for the proper age group (puppy, adult, or senior), and that the food is certified to meet the nutritional requirements set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). And, unless you are independently wealthy, price.<br /><br />Because my dog is not a picky eater, I can't comment on the taste of Chef Michael's. However, it is much higher in calories than a basic dog food such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005M16UG0"">Pedigree Adult Complete Nutrition Small Crunchy Bites Original Beef Dry Dog Food, 30-Pound</a>, which means that a much smaller amount should be fed, something that she definitely objects to.<br /><br />There is one notable point about Chef Michael's-<br />All pet foods produced in the United States must meet certain minimal nutritional requirements, which are set by AAFCO. Somewhere on its bag or can each food will have a short statement saying that is has either been *formulated* to meet AAFCO standards, or has undergone *feeding trials* and been shown to meet AAFCO standards. AAFCO has set standards for 2 life stages; growth (i.e. puppies) and reproduction, and adult. (Senior is not recognized as a separate stage.) Because feeding trials are so expensive, such foods are usually formulated to meet the needs of *all life stages*. Growth and gestation/lactation have much higher nutritional requirements than a normal adult dog has. Therefore, such a food may not be ideal, particularly if you pet has a weight problem.  Foods that are *formulated* (i.e. do not undergo feeding tests), are more often designed to meet the needs of a specific life stage. Chef Michael's is the only pet food (dog or cat), that I have ever found that has undergone feeding trials AND is designed for a specific life stage.<br /><br />The importance of feeding trials, formulations, and life stages is debatable, and in the end is an individual decision.<br /><br />Finally, despite what some people claim, it is not possible to assess the quality of a food from the ingredient list. Ingredient descriptions, for example any listing of a meat product or by-product, are vague and there can be huge variation in the quality of a product with the same name from one food to another. In the same vein, claims that certain ingredients shouldn't be in dog food should be taken with a grain (or large jar) of salt. When chosing a food for your pet, talk to your vet, don't believe a stranger on the internet with unknown qualifications.<br /><br />As for me, although my dog enjoyed Chef Michael's, both the calorie content and price are too high to make it her normal dog food."
1,"I have two dogs, both Pomeranians. One is 16 and has no teeth, and the other is eight and an extremely picky eater. My older dog will eat just about anything, so it was no surprise to me that the minute I poured this into a bowl he beelined straight for it and tried to chow down. Only -- poor dog -- these pieces were too hard and too large for him.<br /><br />The picky eater, on the other hand, gave these a whiff and timidly tried a few bites. In my household, this is a success! It's a rare story for him to even try anything new we buy for him. We leave these out all day for the dogs to eat whenever they get hungry and I will spy the picky dog going for a nibble throughout the day."
1,"Mickey, my toy poodle..who is overweight by the way, has been eating Beneful (healthy weight) not sure why, since he is as I stated overweight. I was trying to save this bag for when I ran out of the big bag I already have. I noticed that Mickey eats all of the soft pieces from his bowl, and leaves the others there until he is starving,so I thought why not try it out.<br /><br />Well he was excited by the bag itself..and it does look good enough for human consumption if you just look at the bag, so he probably thought it was real food, I don't think he caught the ""Chef Michael"" but maybe he did since he sometimes acts as if he can read. Anyway, he was jumping up and down and ready to eat.<br /><br />I only give him half a cup, but he munched it right up. Afterwards, I caught him going in the bag..which he never does, so I had to lock it up! This am, he was so ready to eat that he came straight in from his morning business..I didn't have to call him or hunt him down!<br /><br />I don't know if it's actually good for him..I don't read labels..sorry but from some of the other reviews..it ain't good for him! If Mickey were writing the review I think he would give it 10 stars..maybe his old food is boring. If you are concerned about the ingredients, you may want to pick another kind. Mickey is 8yrs old..so I treat him like a senior citizen and let him eat almost whatever he wants. :)"
1,The dogs absolutely love it! It's not boring like other brands and the ingredient list gives me the impression that someone has put a lot of thoughts into the production of this item.
1,"First of all, I really like this dog food because the first ingredient is real beef, not grains or gluten.<br />Second, the meat has a really interesting texture - like a cross between beef jerky and a puffed snack.  The vegetables are like regular dog kibble.<br />Third, my dog really loves this!  We have a 13 pound dog and the pieces aren't too big for him.  Usually he gets tired of his dog food after a while, but so far he still loves this food!  Unfortunately he keeps begging for it when it isn't time to eat, haha...<br />I would definitely order this food for our dog again."
1,"I used to tell of the tales when I worked as a stock boy at a local grocery, and wondered about all the old people in the dog food aisle, looking at the better canned brands.  I remarked to one of the other stockers that old people must really love their dogs they are always buying the best stuff. I would never get anything beyond dry for my sisters cat.  They basically told me I didn't understand the situation, these people were on social security with no savings and could barely afford utilities.  They bought good dogfood cause they got it for themselves!<br /><br />Well that said, the gal Karine, that takes care of my poodle while I work in Chicago said that if she got to that bad in retirement, she would condsider eating this dog food, Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin. Because my poodle Sandy would pick it off the top of the bowl, she mixed it with the other dry food. Sandy stays in a large pen during part of the day, his food and water are there.  When Karine returned to walk Sandy, she noticed that the food was spread over one of the pads in the pen, and all the Chef Michael's stuff was picked out!<br /><br />The very top or the most prominant ingredient in this food was beef, and the stuff looks like it, and apparently the dog has judged it to be better than the average fare.  Smart dog, it looks pretty healthy too from the rest of the ingredients. I will likely buy this one, as a good suppliment to mix with the EVO I usually buy."
1,"My dogs really seemed to like Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin dog food, judging by the way they gobbled it up.  The company that makes this has a come a looooong way in choosing the best ingredients with nutrition in mind.  Real meat is the first thing on the list of what it's made from, and they use a vitamin E preservative instead of BHA or BHT.  (I won't feed my dogs anything made with that crap)<br /><br />I was happily surprised with the high quality of this food, and I bought another bag for the pooches the other day."
1,"My picky eater actually likes this dry food and he doesn't like much.  He's always been a fan of Chef Michael's wet food but there aren't many bags of dry food that he will eat without my having to jazz them up with gravy, table scraps, etc.  The Chef Michael's dry food apparently is the one rare exception."
1,"Didn't like the taste of it much myself, but the same can't be said for my dog.  He must really like it considering he usually takes his sweet time getting to his dog dish.  He seems a bit more anxious to get to this, so it must be good."
0,"I have a large mutt who is a fairly fussy eater. When I was offered the opportunity to review this dog food, I thought Buck was in for a treat from some fancy dog food - a nice change from the usual kibble. And, my first impression, when I opened the bag of dog food, was ""Oh, this looks good.""<br /><br />But, it was all downhill from there. First I looked on the bag to see how much I was supposed to feed my dog. One cup per 10 pounds. One cup per 10 pounds! That's 8 cups/day for my large dog. There's a lot of filler in this dog food. I feed 3 1/2 cups/day of my regular dog food.<br /><br />So, I thought maybe the Chef Michael's would be better used as a replacement for just a small portion of the regular food to give Buck a treat. Based on the appearance, I was sure it must taste good. Much to my surprise, my dog did not really care for this dog food. He didn't hate it and did eventually eat what I put out, but was not at all enthusiastic about it."
1,"My elderly dog (15 year old beagle) can't see much any more, or hear much, but she still really enjoys her food.  Zoe usually turns her nose up at anything other than her regular food, but not this time.  She dived in and did't stop until it was gone.  Not wanting to change completely, we mixed it with her life long food - Science Diet.  She picked out the Chef Michael's pieces and at them first.  It's softer than regular dry and I think she liked that, and it smell good, even to me.<br />There is a variety of shapes and we saved the bigger chunks to give her as a treat.  That's how much she loves this food.  My picky eater picked  Chef Michaels!  And at 15, she get anything she wants."
1,"If my dog could write this review, I'm pretty sure she would say ""This is the best dog food EVER!"".  Zoe is 7 years old and a very healthy eater.  She eats her food as soon as we put it down.  We normally feed her a dry, grain-free food because I think it's the most nutritious for her and the best for her teeth. We alternate between a turkey and sweet potato food and a salmon and sweet potato food. She eats it just fine.  But, let's face it, our dogs would rather be eating what we're eating. I think she thinks Chef Michael's is people food.  I've never seen her more enthusiastic about breakfast and dinner times.<br /><br />But, as her father, it's my job to make sure she's getting the best food for her.  I'm not 100% convinced Chef Michael's is it.  There is no consensus on whether grain is good for your dog. But, we've decided to go with foods that don't include grains.  Chef Michael's, #1 ingredient is beef.  So, that' good. But, that's followed by soy and then a whole host of grains.  So, if I had to guess, I would say this food is largely, if not mostly grains (if you add all the grains up together).  Ingredients are listed by the which is the most first in descending order.  But,  just because an ingredient is first  doesn't mean the others don't add up to more than it. The longer the list of ingredients, the more likely that is.  Just like with people food, I think generally, the shorter the list of ingredients the better (except for when you get into the added nutrients at the end- vitamins, minerals, etc.).  As for potatoes and green beans, those follow sirloin flavoring on the list of ingredients. Since sirloin flavoring is added, that probably indicates the beef isn't sirloin steak (I know you're shocked).  So, don't be lulled into thinking you're feeding your dog a sirloin, green bean and potato dinner here.  You're feeding her beef, grains and some bits probably colored and flavored to looks like green beans and potatoes.  Another thing about the food that your dog will probably love is it's semi-moist and semi-soft.  I think dogs prefer moist foods over dry.  We feed dry because I think it's better for her teeth. Also, when  you buy moist food, you are paying for water as opposed to nutritional ingredients.  This food only has about 15% less calories per cup than the food I feed my dog. But, the feeding instruction on the bag say to feed one cup for every 10 pounds of your dog's weight.  I don't know how much you feed your dog.  But, we feed our 70 pound lab-mixed breed a cup in the morning and a cup in the evening.  I cannot imagine feeding her 7 cups of any food per day.<br /><br />Personally, I wouldn't serve this to my dog every day for the reasons stated above.  But, I'm sure she'd love it if I did.  I think it's a great treat for her and maybe a little break from the boring dry food we feed her.  I don't think it would be a horrible choice for a long term food though.  For those reasons, I give it four stars."
1,"We normally feed our dog beneful, it's what she was fed in the rescue center, she does like it & always looks for more. When I saw Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin, I thought, yeah right, no way there's meat in there.<br /><br />It is more expensive than beneful, but my dog really, really likes this brand. I'm sure there are a gizzilion bad things in this, but if you add a bit of water, the meat pieces do get soft & has the consistency of wet dog food. It's not all meat, the filler pieces of green & yellow kibble are the same as beneful (vegatables & soy & fillers, etc - green beans - really???).<br /><br />This is a nice treat for our dog, she likes it almost as much as canned food, but this has the convenience of dry dog food."
1,"Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food claims to be more than your boring kibble and they are right.  The pieces come in a couple different shapes and sizes.  It has round crunchy kibble and more jagged shaped tender pieces (although the ""tender pieces"" started to get harder the less there is even though the ""Best if Used By"" is about a year and a half after I got the bag).  Of course the look and feel of the food does not mean anything if the dogs refuse to eat it, but both of my dogs dug right in right when I put their bowls in front of them.  The only problem I ran into was that one of my dogs is an elderly Chihuahua with many of his teeth taken out due to rotting who was slower to eat the bigger ""tender pieces"" and since it took him much longer to finish his dinner than my other dog, they sometimes would get in a growling match because my other dog would sit and try to finish off the bowl for the Chihuahua."
1,I foster for local dog rescues so my pack is a little larger than the average home. Some of the dogs are picky eaters so I struggle to find a dog food that will please them all. Sadly Chef Michaels was not one that will make them all happy. About 75% of my dogs ate the food just fine but some of them wanted nothing to do with it. I guess it just depends on whether your dog will love it or not.
1,"Here is one of those products that is marketed more to the consumer (human). It is almost as appetizing to the human food critic's eyes with both eye appeal and color of the food. With that being said... My dog liked this Purina dog food, by Chef Michael's, just fine. He finished the bag off completely, without discrimination. Honestly, he does this with just about any quality of food. I guess I got lucky that way. It is unfortunate that my dog does know what it's like to be hungry, thus he is less likely to be finicky.<br /><br />I do believe in healthy foods for my pet and not so much those filler ingredients. However, these foods can be supplemented in his diet by adding veggies and whole meats to any brand of dog food that is not fortified or primaried with such, and Purina is no exception.<br /><br />In addition to their bagged dog food, I like to give my dog a hearty beef rib once a week. This only costs an additional $10.00 for a rack of 8-12 hearty ribs. Not to shabby for a 2-3 month supply.<br /><br />As a consumer, I rely mostly on the marketing of what is in the packages ingredients list and trusting that Purina is using the ingredients of the highest quality in this and all of their products. And when they list beef as the first ingredient, that it is the primary ingredient and not made with the least amount. And down the near future, I do not hear about a recall on this pet food because it was tainted with... who knows what.<br /><br />As far as the dog food goes, it was liked by my pet and he did seem to enjoy it, that's what matters most. I truly hope it is benefical for him and that my pet gets a good nutritious meal out of it."
1,"I was hoping my dog wouldn't like this dog food. I already have a nice, boring brand that I buy for him. It's healthy and although he doesn't jump up and down for it, he eats it. He reacts a bit differently with this one. He goes nuts for it!  It is dry and at times he has coughed a little after eating it too fast, but he has learned not to do that. I'll be buying it. I'm not sure yet if it will be a new staple in his diet or for special occasions."
1,"My two Labradors took to this food right out of the bag and finished off the sample bag (from the vine program) in short order. Being that the main ingredient is meats, it is exactly what you should be feeding your dogs.<br /><br />I highly recommend this food."
1,"I have 4 dogs & we're very picky on their food.<br />Because of that - we give them IAMS<br />But I know they get tired of the same food so we always get a ""filler"" food to add in the bottom of their IAMS - gives them something to look forward to.<br />They are picky eaters... usually what they like the best if Kibble N Bits ... anything else, they'll leave some at the bottom.  But tried this because I've heard Chef Michael's is healthier then other brands...<br />the dogs love it... eat every bit of it...<br />I dont give a lot where I have to worry about digestion changes - which is nice - but will keep an eye out to get more of this to add to their bowls."
1,"We recently changed our dog's normal food because she has gotten picky and no longer wants to eat the premium brand we've bought for several years.  We've tried several types thus far and she likes them all (who says dogs don't need variety in their food?).  Since the Chef Michael's was offered as part of the Amazon Vine program, I decided to give it a try.  The first day of trying Chef Michael's, as soon as I mixed it with her current food, she gobbled the whole bowl.  That's different for her.  She usually leaves some of her food so she can eat throughout the day.  As time has gone by, I've noticed she will dig through the bowl of mixed food and pick out the Chef Michael's pieces, eat them first and then nibble on the other brand in the bowl.  If she leaves any food in the bowl to come back and eat later in the day, it's always the other food, not Chef Michael's.<br /><br />Yes, the Chef Michael's food is expensive but it's not out of line with other the other premium dog foods we've been buying at the pet store.  As a matter of fact, it's considerably lower priced than some of them.  So price is not really a big factor in buying this dog food if you've been buying premium brands all along.<br /><br />The ingredients are consideration, however.  Some of the ingredients in the Chef Michael's is not exactly on the politically correct list for healthy eating.  For that reason, we will probably continue to follow our current procedure of mixing a little of the Chef Michael's with a larger quantity of another type of premium and better nutritionally balanced food.  Our pooch loves it and adding a little pizzazz to her meals brightens up her day.  That's worth a lot.<br /><br />If this review was based on nutritional value alone, I would probably give it 3 stars.  It's not really bad as far as nutrition is concerned but it's not as good as other foods within the same price range.  But I bow to the family dog whose opinion is paramount."
1,"This Chef Michael's grilled sirloin flavor went over well with the dogs, while both are older the lapdog has a hard time with some dry foods, he was able to chew through this. I like to change dog foods often to avoid a build up of any one ingredient or vitamin, some dog foods give the dogs loose stool, but we had no problems with this. First ingredient is beef, soy, animal fat, brewers rice, corn coming far down the list which is something I prefer, we will buy this dog food again."
1,"Obviously I am not going to taste this stuff.  But the dog loves it.  In fact he likes it so much that he no longer wants eat his regular food, so I am now using the as treat food.  Really can't find anything bad to say about the food.  Our dog goes the town on it with the same zeal he normally holds for wet food."
1,"I have two large dogs and a relative budget.  So this maybe terrible of me, but I don't mind a little filler.  And my dogs are healthy and active (even the senior) and they've been fed on easily accessible and relatively affordable brands all of their lives.  Though there are some questionable ingredients in Chef Michaels, and some known fillers, the number one ingredient is beef and this flavor also includes filet mignon flavors, green beans and potatoes. I should say it's a pretty small bag for the cost, so over the long term this may cost twice as much. However, they really did seem to enjoy it.  I would purchase this again."
1,"Our 2 dogs tried Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavor dog food, made with real beef.  One is a Basset and one a smaller Terrier.  Both ate without any hesitation.  The food is colorful (for the human appeal) with crunchy kibbles as well as tender pieces.  I prefer to feed our dogs crunchy kibbles if they are able to eat it, because I think it keeps their teeth cleaner.  There seemed to be more large tender pieces than crunchy, but the dogs loved it all.  The food size was fine for both the large dog and the small dog.  The large dog transitioned from her regular food to Chef's with no trouble.  The smaller dog had some digestive issues for a few days (very soft stools) until that cleared up and she was fine.  The bag claims ""23 essential vitamins & minerals"" and a ""well rounded meal for adult dogs"".<br /><br />One nice packaging plus was the bag shows the actual size pieces of food, something helpful to me with 2 different sized dogs.  Overall, I could say the food was a hit at this dog house."
1,"My dog really loved the taste of this food.  It has meat chunks mixed with kibble, although the meat looks a bit like pink play-dough.  I've found it to be a perfect treat to stuff inside her Kong to keep her busy, since it is tasty and attractive but not messy and won't stick to the inside of the kong. I wouldn't use it personally as her main food however since corn and soy and corn and soy products are at the top of the ingredient list.  (Although meat is the first ingredient which is a plus, since many commercial pet food has corn or soy as the number one ingredient).  However, since pretty much all US grown soy and corn is GMO, I try to limit that in pet foods that I use as the main food for my pets.  Dogs are omnivores, however they are not intended to eat a majority of their food as grain so always avoid foods with corn as number one ingredient.  This seems like a higher end commercial brand, but nutritionally there are much, much better options (Innova, Solid Gold).  As a treat, however, I think this is a great product and probably less fat and junk than most dog ""treat"" products."
1,"My dogs are always begging for table scrapes.  As we all know that own dogs it is not good to give in to them.  We have many dogs and as I said they are not crazy about any dog food that we offer them. I keep telling them they are not people, but they just don't seem to get the hint. I brought the bag of Chef Michael's food into the kitchen and opened it up, to my surprise I had 5 dogs around me within minutes. How could they smell food that fast? Amazing.  I put a cup full in each of their dishes and set it down for them. Before I had the last dish down the dogs had finished the first ones. What?  My dogs hate dry dog food, what were they doing eating this?  I decided to do a little experiment and put down some of their regular food and some of Chef Michael's, side by side.  They all tried to get chef Michaels and totally ignored their regular dog food. I put it up and decided I'd try again the next day knowing sometimes they gobble up something the first time just because its new.  The next day I did the same thing and again they all charged for Chef Michael's food.  There you have it. My dogs loved it, and since it is dog food they have the final say."
1,"Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin was a very nice, tasty change that our dog absolutely loved.<br /><br />He has been eating grain free Taste Of The Wild for a few months. He picks at it, and eats what he needs to, I guess, but he never ""gobbles it up.""  I never get the impression that he eats it and likes it - it is more like he eats it because he knows it's his food and he has to eat. He would always be really impatient, licking his lips and sitting by my feet at the stove,  when I cook dinner because he so much looked forward to his steak, pork chop or chicken breast. (Yes, I cook a fat trimmed meat serving especially for him, without seasonings, etc, and he eats dinner when we do. His food bowl is always filled as well though and he can graze as he pleases. Alot of people think this is bad, but as long as he is as healthy and muscular as he is, the vet said we are doing fine for him.)<br /><br />Moving onto the new stuff...I filled his dish with the Chef Michael's and he really went right into it and cleaned the bowl. It looks and smells like it would be tasty/appealing to a dog. It certainly looks more appetizing than the other food that is all one shape and size. It definitely has a meaty (although processed/artificial) smell.<br /><br />There is no doubt that he thoroughly loved every bit of it. He was excitied from the moment he sniffed at it as I poured it in his bowl. He sat there wagging his tail and licking his chops as I filled the container to his automatic feeding bowl - he knows he has to ""wait"" and keep his nose out of the bowl as I fill it. I could tell he was happy and excited to try something yummy and new. For the few days this bag lasted, he wasn't as anxious when he knew I was cooking dinner. This dog food must have satisfied his taste buds much better than the Taste Of The Wild.<br /><br />I do think it is more of a ""treat"" or junk food though and not something that I would buy continuously and feed exclusively. It is fairly pricy and the nutrition content is not totally on par with what I like for him. I mean, it's not absolutely terrible nutrition-wise, but it isn't the healthiest either. It does have some fillers, but I have seen much, much worse on the market. This at least has actual meat as the first ingredient.<br /><br />I plan to buy these smaller 4.5 bags occasionaly and add a handful or so into his regular food once a day or every few days, for a little extra flavor or treat. Taste Of the Wild is good for him, but it really doesn't seem as appealing as something like this Chef Michael's. We all like a little junk/fast food every now and then and I imagine our dog does as well. This 4.5lb bag lasted him about 3.5 days while he ate it exclusively. It just seems like this would be pretty expensive to feed as his regular food. If it was totally nutritious and healthy for him, I wouldn't mind the cost. Plus, I could definitely see a pet overeating it just because it (apparently) tastes so good and/or because it would provide empty calories and he would end up hungry more often/sooner between meals - just like when people eat fast/junk food.<br /><br />Overall, I give it a good 4 stars. I knocked the one star off for the cost/nutrition ratio."
1,"Boy, am I so tired of reading reviews bemoaning the ingredients in dog food these days.  All the whiners claim that such-and-such is too corm or soy heavy, or that it is not gluten free or some other such crap.  Guess what...It's DOG FOOD! For the love of all that is holy would you tools quit your whine-fest and go away!  For the record, this product did exactly what it was supposed to do.  Do you know what that is?  It fed my dogs.  Furthermore, they all seemed to enjoy it and have not shown any ill effects or digestive ailments (Not a single degree higher on the dog-fart scale, so I am happy).  Sure our dogs are our babies, but the same people who cry about dog food ingredients are the same ones who took the score out of childrens' sports and think everyone is a winner.  Total and complete imbeciles.  Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food will always be welcome in my home.  Our pets are only given a short time with us on this planet, so why not let them enjoy their little lives to the fullest.  Give them what they want.  If this dog food makes them wag their happy little tails, then have at it.  I found this to be a great product and I hope you do to.  The naysayers need to get a grip on reality or just raise children instead.  They don't deserve dogs!  Highly Recommended!"
1,"Wow, do our dogs ever love this food!  It is softer and much meatier than other dog food we've purchased.  Our older cat likes it too.  I think the fact that it's not as crunchy is easier on the older dogs teeth.  This is a real treat for them."
1,"I received a bag of this dog food through the Amazon Vine program, and when I sprung it on my two dogs, they couldn't get enough of it. Wow, do they love this stuff. Ever since I began feeding them this food, they actually seem like happier pets.<br /><br />The only drawback is that they wolf it down very fast after I dump it in the dog dishes, acting as though they've never eaten before. But it makes them happy and that's the important thing."
0,"Ground Yellow Corn, Corn Gluten Meal, Animal Fat preserved in mixed-tocopherols and Soy: Be very careful of these ingredients.<br /><br />If you spot them in any dog food, it's a giant red flag. It seems a lot of Dog Food these days just have to have them. My dog absolutely loved this brand, but at the moment, I am treating this bag as a treat, just like we give chocolate to kids. We know they aren't really good for your health, but I am hoping giving them once in a while won't hurt them too much.<br /><br />Go with certified brands like Canidae and Wellness, and stay away from ones that contain those ingredients I listed above."
0,"This food appears attractive and healthy when poured into a bowl - it looks like chunks of dried meat among veggie-rich kibbles. My dog very happily scarfed it down.<br /><br />I, unfortunately, read the ingredient list. It is extremely soy and corn heavy (both almost guaranteed to be GM), and includes nasty items like poultry by-product meal and animal digest. Whatever those chunks are, they are in no way related to real meat.<br /><br />As much as my dog loved this, I will not be making it part of his regular diet - it's just not real food."
0,"I ordered this without first reading the ingredients--was suckered in by the name and the packaging when looking at amazon's vine program offerings last month.<br />As a compulsive label reader and nutrition researcher this was completely my bad and I own it.<br />That said, this is one of the more expensive ""junk foods"" for dogs that I have seen lately.  While it may have beef as the first ingredient, when you factor in all the remaining negative ingredients there is simply no way to offset the good with the bad.  Other reviews have gone into great detail on the ingredients and their negative impact on your pet's health so I'm not going to repeat that.  Just chiming in!<br />It frustrates me when people say they can't afford to feed their families or pets good quality, nutritious food (as opposed to factory produced calories packaged in grocery stores and served in restaurants).<br />When you factor in the cost to your health and the fact that you are nutritionally starving yourself (or your family/pets) the cost for good food (and I mean FOOD, not calories) is actually less expensive.<br />Off the soapbox..."
0,"My older dog loved this dog food, maybe because it is soft and easy to chew. My ""puppy"" scarfed it down, but she had bad runs afterward (though to be fair, I have heard that anytime you switch up your dog's food that can happen).<br /><br />I researched this dog food at Dog Food Advisor. They analyzed the ingredients in Chef Michael's, concluding that it uses soybean meal, soy protein concentrate and corn gluten meal to boost the protein content, and that it likely only has a modest amount of meat. They do not recommend it. Based on my experience, that is good advice."
1,"Of course it does!  Unless you have one of those super rotten dogs that barks constantly, bites little kids, and begs even when you reach for the remote.  This is faaaaar to good for THAT dog.  But certainly a very nice change of pace for well-behaved pooches of all shapes and sizes.  Clearly I can't get an exact read on what my dogs liked so much about the food, though I will say upon initially opening the bag that I nearly ate a nugget(long day at work and looks and smells delicious!).  If a grown man nearly couldn't resist diving in, just think how much your dogs will like it!  Maybe that should be their slogan?"
1,"This was a big hit at the kennel that masquerades as our home.<br /><br />Here's some background on the test subjects:<br />We have 3 dogs (basset hound, black lab, rottweiler) that vary in size from 50 to 75 pounds.<br />They go through a 15.5 lbs of Beneful Healthy Weight dog food every week at a cost of about $15.<br />The basset and rotty eat everything in sight. The black lab is a very finicky eater.<br /><br />With that in mind, here's my review:<br /><br />Chef Michael's food is chewier, the meat bits anyway, than the dry food that we use.  The dogs love that and they scoffed it up, even finicky Ashley.<br /><br />It's pieces are also smaller in size which they apparently like because they eat it much faster.<br /><br />Based on our dogs eating habits, we would need about 3.5 bags of Chef Michael's awesome food per week.  This would cost about $35, an increase of $20 per week to feed the hounds.<br /><br />It's a great product. However, if money is a factor, I would recommend it for owners that have 1 small to medium size dog.<br /><br />Also, if you're going to pay that much, the bag should be resealable.  This and the cost is what made me knock it down to 4 stars.<br /><br />UPDATE: 8/28  While this food is expensive, it turns out that my one dog Ashley after eating this wont eat the other food that we usually have to doctor with parm cheese and bread crumbs. We gave up and bought another bag today.  Ashley ate it right up.  We have decided to feed Ashley this and the other dogs can eat the Beneficial.  We paid 2.00 more at the grocery store for this food so we ordered to more bags via Amazon.  For a picky eater it is worth it."
1,"My Jack Russell Terrier has always been a grazer.  No chugging down food for him.  We feed him twice a day, a.m. and p.m. and the food goes slowly when he's hungry throughout the day and evening. We've been giving him a dry organic kibble mixed with a wet organic canned food.  He likes it well enough but I don't think he gets much pleasure from eating.<br /><br />I decided to try the Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food. What a surprise.  My dog, Sky, went to town and ate it all at once.  I was a little nervous that his digestive system would be upset but he's as good as new.  No upsets.  What is really nice is that he enjoys eating his food.  It's there and gone quickly.  He savors his food and eats it in one sitting.  It's nice to see that.  I will be using this dog food in the future.  If Sky could talk, he would thank Vine and Purina for the opportunity of trying this dog food.<br /><br />By the way, I switched all at once from one diet to the other and there were no repercussions."
1,"I'm always a little challenged to review something my dogs eat, but in this case, my dogs have enthusiastically communicated that they enjoyed this product.  So as far as taste goes, this is a winner.<br /><br />But what about nutrition?  Most of the leading ingredients are proteins, which puts this in a different category of quality from the more corn based dog foods (this still does have corn and rice, but they seem to be about a fifth of the content).  Much of the protein is from soy instead of animals.  It's also been dyed, which doesn't seem necessary to me.  It looks pleasing to people, but there's not much reason to give a dog colored food.  But in my opinion, a dog can be healthy eating this as long as it's part of a balanced diet.<br /><br />I would add veggies and actual meat from my own dinners to my dog's diet.  I tend to give them both at least a serving every day, but then they eat some kind of normal dog food for the majority of their diet.  This approach has led to my dogs being healthy and living long lives.<br /><br />There are more expensive and healthier dog foods, but Chef Michael's dog food is a healthier and apparently tastier alternative to the other grocery store brands."
1,"I have to admit up front that I don't own a dog.  But my fianc&eacute;e and my neighbor do. A Golden Retriever and a Datsun respectively.  Both of them are fussy about what their dogs eat, but not what I would call fanatical.  Both of them also agreed that this dog food is very far from the worse that they have tried as far as quality goes.  But at the same time for the price they are suggesting the nutritional value could be much better.  As for the dogs review, there is no question that they both loved it.  Not only did they both savor it fully, but there were no side effects noted in either dog as to gas, bloating, belly aches, etc.  My conclusion based on their reviews and remarks is that this is a medium to very good quality dog food that carries a premium price.  But also one that both dogs in the tests here seem to gobble up enthusiastically.  My suggestion would be to perhaps buy this for a delicious treat for your dog, and pick up something else a little more reasonably priced for their everyday diet... : )"
1,"Our two large dogs really like this product. They gobbled it down and wanted more. Since they are on the chunky side, we try to limit their food intake a bit. This dog food satisfied them and gave them a meal which they really appeared to enjoy."
1,My 8 year old dog loved Chef Michaels Grilled Sirloin food.  I loved that the very first ingredient is beef and that the bits of food look like little chunks of food and that the dog food didn't smell horrible like some dog foods.  The 4.5 lb bag lasted us about 2 weeks with a once a day feeding schedule.
1,"My dogs LOVE this food. In fact, if I fill their bowls with it, they won't stop eating until it is gone. So I have started putting a little bit on top of their regular food, Wellness, as a little treat. They can't get enough of it! They actually make a complete mess digging through the bowl of regular food to find the Chef Michael's food, spilling their food everywhere! They think this food is better than the actual treats I give them.<br /><br />It also looks good. Kibble is usually these nondescript little balls of unidentifiable substance, but Chef Michael's LOOKS like real food! My dogs are picky about their kibble, but they certainly love this stuff!!"
1,"I have two maltese dogs, a male who is 13 and a female who is 11.  The female will eat nearly anything that doesn't try to eat her first.  The male will hardly eat at all unless you beg him.  Both of them liked the grilled sirloin part pretty well.  The ""potato and green bean garnish"" part tended to stay in the bowl a while, though my little girl would eventually eat that, too, usually.  Dogs are not fans of veggies of any kind and so I was not surprised.  But overall, they liked it pretty well, which is saying a lot for what is mostly a dry dog food.  I have not seen this in the store where I buy my dog food.  When it does (and if it does) the price will determine for me whether I'll start buying this brand or stay with the brand I was already using.  I think my dogs liked this enough that I'd be willing to switch, but only if the price was the same or not much more."
1,"I have to state up front that my dog is a very picky eater, so judging any kind of food with him is tricky.  The first thing I noticed is that the bag I received was not resealable.  The scissor cut line is below what looked like a zipper line, but the bag did not open until I cut below it.  The food itself is very different looking and smells very nice, as far as dog food goes.  My dog initially turned his nose up at it, but went back to eating virtually everything put in his bowl within a few hours.  That's more than he will for almost every dry dog food I've tried with him.  Most likely, I will try another bag of Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dog Food in the future."
1,"My dog is not the most persnickety dog I've ever met; she eats raccoon poop sometimes, but then again she won't eat just anything--won't touch half the veggie food that I serve at the table.  But this food, she loves.  She usually eats most dog foods just until she's full and then leaves the rest for later.  But this food she eats like a kid eats candy.  I think she would eat the whole bag if I let her.<br /><br />The food pieces are moist and tender, not as moist as canned food, but not crunchy like other dry dog food.  There are little pieces that look like meat, but when you look closely you can tell it's some sort of conglomerate food, sort of like a chicken nugget idea.  There's obviously food coloring in here-- the pieces are different pretty colors.  How do dogs do with red 40?  She seems fine after eating one dose anyway.<br /><br />Okay, personal problem here... is it ethical to be eating a vegan diet myself and be serving sirloin beef to my dog?  I can justify serving the dog the leftover meat stuff that probably wouldn't be used for anything else and would probably be thrown away otherwise.  But to kill one mammal to feed another?  Even if she is my best buddy, that bothers me.  She likes it.  So, whatever, I'll think this over and see if I keep buying it."
1,"My dogs were INSANE for this food when it hit their food dish.  The two of them took turns darting in for a mouthful which is amazing, since they usually eat at completely different times.  I would caution to put out a limited amount at first, because my littlest dog ate and ate til she had to run outside to throw up - it was so good she just couldn't stop.<br /><br />I will definitely be purchasing this food for my dogs."
1,"This is good stuff for our paunchy pug! For a while our dog, Ruby, wasn't eating hard food, due to problems with her teeth, but now that she's able to again, Chef Michael's by Purina® seems to suit our canine just fine. In fact, she eats it with gusto (like most everything else!). This blend smells like normal dog food but is more varied than the typical stuff we give Ruby. It's got the ""grilled sirloin steak flavor,"" which she's used to, but the ""potato and green bean garnishes"" are something different -- and I think she likes the added taste. The kibble colors are an interesting mix of bacon-looking brown, light brown and green (which I assume is the green bean portion).<br /><br />I get the feeling that Purina® puts a lot of effort and sincerity into its products, and I like the fact that there are 23 crucial minerals and vitamins to enhance Ruby's health. The food is a mix of ""tender pieces"" and ""crunchy kibbles,"" which again provides some diversity compared to what our dog is usually fed.<br /><br />Authentic beef, protein, veggies and important nutrients -- what else could your lovable pooch want in a meal? Well, except for your table scraps, of course!"
1,"Our Chihuahua is not a picky eater by any means, she will eat just about anything that is given to her.<br />We normally feed her Iams dog food and occasionally she gets wet dog food (actually, we purchase the Chef Michael's wet canned dog food and she loves it), and that is a huge treat to her.<br />Every day when we feed her the Iams dry food, she could really care less and eats it as she pleases (but does finish her food).<br />We have been feeding her the Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food for a little over a week now, and she is waiting by her dish to  be fed, she acts as  if this is a dog treat for her.<br />The dog food looks a little odd, but our dog loves it!<br />So far, yes it has been only  a little over a week of her eating it daily, and no complaints. If something changes I will most definately update.<br />I am thinking, this may be our Chihuahuas new choice in dog food!"
1,"My girls are very picky about what they eat and we rarely try any new products anymore because we usually end up giving most of bag to another dog. This time they fooled us. They absolutely love this stuff. It is supposed to smell like sirloin steak which it must since they rush to gobble it down. They have never cared for hamburgers all that much....pampered pets like steaks instead and this must actually smell like steak. So rather than giving this bag away, we will be buying more!"
1,"What a great way to spoil your dog! I'm glad we got a chance to try these out because the dogs enjoyed them very much. Mind you, Chloe and JJ are not picky, they'd eat a worn out gym sock if I put it on a plate and said ""yum"". But, this product is actually good for them and they enjoy it. All kidding aside, this is a quality product that your dog will enjoy, just remember to keep your socks on, eh?"
1,"I have a Lab and a Papillon.  The Lab will eat anything and this works great.  The Papillon is picky and likes it better than any other dry food I've tried.  The food looks and smells appetizing.  The drawbacks are that the cost is fairly high, it has very questionable ingredients including poultry by-product meal and animal digest, and it is soft, thereby of little use in cleaning their teeth.  I will probably not continue with this food.  Instead, there are truly dry foods, with at least as good ingredients, that cost less and that will help with their teeth.  For treats, I'll continue with regular treats (Milkbone for example) or canned food.  This food might work for some picky small dogs."
1,"This is an easy review:  put it in the dog dish and see what happens.  Our thin, finnicky eater would let us know.  Verdict:  once a day eater and only when hunger gobbled this down.  Now to the ultimate test:  mix with her regular dog food.  Results:  separates her old food and gobbles Chef Michael's.  Verdict:  my dog absolutely loves this.  Problem:  how can I ever go to another brand."
1,"My littlest pup is the ultimate in picky. She likes a food for one day and hates it the next. For a while we were hand making her food with boiled veggies and meat and feeding her bite by bite on a spoon. Really! That's the only way she would eat anything.<br /><br />Fortunately we found this Chef Michael food. For some reason she loves it. Some days she'll eat it right off the plate! Other days I have to go back to hand feeding her, but she still eats it without her usual protest of turning her head and hiding under the furniture. She likes it, she really likes it!"
1,"My dog is in love with this dog food. She won't even touch her other kind any longer. There are some ingredients that I'm not thrilled about on the ingredients list, but there's not much I can do about that when almost all kinds of dog food have these ingredients. The biggest thing a dog food should be is edible to a dog and my dog loves this and as I can see from other reviews, there are tons of other dogs that love it, too. If you have a picky eater, you should try this food. My dog goes straight for it, the same way she would a treat."
1,"If my 46-lb. Golden Retriever puppy is any indication, this food tastes wonderful to dogs! She sniffed her bowl cautiously the first time we fed it to her, then eagerly wolfed it down and practically licked the bowl clean.<br /><br />Since I don't plan to taste it myself, I can't say much about the flavor.  The appearance is more attractive than most dry dog foods, with bits of vegetables and meats mixed together, rather than monotone brown bits that other dry foods have. Puppy doesn't particularly care what it looks like, of course.<br /><br />I feel foolish even writing it, but I will say this... since we're still in the puppy phase, she still has some accidents in the house.  While we were feeding her Chef Michael's food, we noticed that there was none of the normal foul odor normally associated with her bowel movements... we only discovered that she had gone by visually spotting the accident.  I don't know exactly what that means, but my guess is that this food is providing better nutrition than our prior brand.<br /><br />We're just about ready (per the Vet's instructions) to switch our puppy over to adult food.  Chef Michael's is definitely one we will consider!"
1,"Some people may find the whole idea of the ""Chef Michael"" line a little over the top: Gourmet food for dogs, created by a top chef. To be honest, it isn't likely that we ever would have tried this product if I hadn't been sent a sample package for review.<br /><br />Our dog is an 80 pound mixed Sharpei and Great Dane, and Chef Michael seems to be targeted more to smaller dogs; we would have to give our dog about eight cups a day, and that would get to be a much more costly proposition than his regular dry dog food, a generic brand (which we've lately started mixing with Purina Beneful, which I've reviewed separately).<br /><br />Chef Michael claims to have sirloin steak flavor with potato and green bean accompaniments. In fact, it is 26% beef, and the other items are there, but the mix contains quite a bit of filler. I just don't see the need to feed the dog much in the way of filler, or for that matter to pay for it.<br /><br />Certainly, the dog loves it and it serves (for us) as a great treat item rather than a mainstay of his diet. If you have a smaller dog, and don't mind the higher cost, this could be a regular meal item.<br /><br />But a lot of the makeup of the product seems pitched to a human taste. The beef pieces, which are processed meat, are made up to look like little pieces of steak, complete with grill marks. That's nice, but do you think your dog will notice? Will your dog recognize the potato and green bean accompaniments as he's enjoying his meal? Our dog, frankly, just eats it. He loves it but I doubt that it's because there are faux grill marks on the beef pieces.<br /><br />A comment on the packaging: it would have been nice if the package was resealable. And whoever came up with the photo on the front of the package really needs to go into another line of work. It makes the product look incredibly unappealing.<br /><br />My bottom line is that this is a nice but ultimately unnecessary product. If you want to move up from generic dry dog food, try something like Purina Beneful instead. It's less expensive, less pretentious, and the dog eats it just as eagerly."
1,"Our two dogs are not very picky eaters but when we first put this in their dishes they didn't stop until the bowls were empty; they even went to check each others bowls out to make sure they were empty. I read the ingredients list and was not too happy that there was so much ""other"" materials in the food."
1,My dogs LOVED this product.  When the product arrived they wanted in the package right now.  I found the product to be excellent quality very interesting shapes and very colorful.  I would definetly buy this product for my dogs.
1,I don't know about you but my husband was really impressed with the smell.  But I checked it and it does smell like steak.<br /><br />Small kibble mixed with a larger kibble that I'm assuming is the source of the steak smell...and possibly taste.  (I didn't try it).<br /><br />All three of my dogs loved it and were looking for more.<br /><br />Guess I'll be buying more.... but maybe save it for special occasions when we have steak.<br /><br />Thank you.<br />MEF
1,Got this the other day and have been mixing it with my dogs regular food so as not to be an abrupt change and let me tell you she loves this food.  It's dry but soft and puffy but it's nice to see some veggie like looking pieces in a dry dog food.  I can smell the sirloin beefyness more than any other dog food I've come across.<br /><br />I do like the fact that it is made by Purina which is my favorite company for my pet foods and I like the fact that I can give Maxine something that tastes good and not like saw dust.  I use just a bit more of this that her usual food because it is puffy already but if I compacted it I'm sure it would come to just a wee bit less that what she usually eats.<br /><br />My only problem with most dog foods this one included is the amount of crude fat.  Even though my baby is only eleven pounds and a bit small so doesn't really need to worry about a few extra calories it does stand that it would be nice to see more protien and less crude fat in the current dog foods out there.  My baby likes this and that counts for quite a bit.  Better than giving her table food which I do not believe in.
1,"The # 1 ingredient is beef -- a rarity in today's bagged dog food -- but with the price running a little over $2 per pound, I'm not going to use this in place of the high quality kibble I've been feeding my dogs (for which I pay about $1 per pound). However, my dogs LOVE this stuff, so I see two good uses for it:<br /><br />1.  Add a small handful as a flavor booster to their regular kibble.<br /><br />2.  Because it's easy to handle plus chewy and not crunchy, it makes for great rewards during agility training.<br /><br />If I were using it strictly for their regular food I'd give it a lower rating (because of price), but for the purposes I just stated, I think it's excellent and therefore I'll give five stars.  A bag of this stuff on hand is a lot cheaper than the other products I've been using for agility training rewards!"
1,"We normally combine small packets of moist food with our dogs kibble, since they are picky eaters. I had hoped that they would enjoy this gourmet variety, making it a bit easier on us.<br /><br />I used it for two meals, and they treated it like they do regular kibble, just grazing a bit. They didn't finish it until we added their regular favorite on top of it.<br /><br />I give the food top ratings for being healthy, however given the price and the fact that it will just substitute for regular kibble in our home, I won't be purchasing more."
1,"I have bought chef michael's ""wet"" canned food for my dog.  It's quality stuff and my dog never passes it up in his bowl.<br /><br />Was glad to see a dry food sampling offered on Amazon Vine.  Like the wet food, this dry food doesn't disappoint.  The pieces are a decent size for my dog to chew (He's an 11 lb. Maltese)and eats it all up when in his bowl.<br /><br />A great dry food to mix in with wet food or other good dog-friendly foods like rice and green beans!<br /><br />Another quality product by Chef Michaels!"
1,"My two dogs are Purina dogs so when this new Purina product became available, I snapped it up. Upon opening the bag, my puppies began their happy dance, spinning and hopping around as the smell of sirloin wafted through the air. A real food hound, Finn always dives head-first into his dish and inhales his kibble and this time was no different though I think he actually ate a bit faster than usual. Fiona, on the other hand, is a bit of a princess, especially when it comes to her kibble. She usually gets excited then sits around and waits for her brother to finish so she can tease him. This time, however, she couldn't wait and immediately started snarfing down her kibble.<br /><br />A great product that I will definitely purchase for my furry kids!"
1,"All of my dogs absolutely love this food including my notoriously picky Chihuahua. The downside, as many other reviews mention, are the ingredients are grain heavy so I have been mixing it with their regular brand of meat heavy foods. I have a hard time getting my Chihuahua to eat so I am willing to mix this in if it gets her to eat more."
1,"I can start out by saying that my two dogs both love this food, and by their reaction, I could say it's their favorite.  There are things I like about it too.  It smells decent, and has a texture unlike any other food we've ever tried.  It is a bit softer and easier on my older dog's teeth and gums.  Most importantly, my dogs have absolutely no digestive problems after eating this, unlike some other brands we have used.  The ingredient list on the package, however. indicates it is more in line with other supermarket brands, but so does the price.  I would love to say I only buy the most premium products, but realistically I want a food my dogs like, that makes them feel good and has adequate nutrients, and this fits the bill.  I feed my dogs real meat on occasion, and buy the premium brands when I can get a sale, but I feel comfortable that this dog food is fine for most of my dog's needs."
1,"My dog is PICKY! She only eats deli turkey meat. When she gets hungry, she will eat a few grains of dog food, but grudgingly.<br />I normally feed her Blue Wilderness and other natural dog foods. I've tried many brands, but can't find any that she likes, so when I got the opportunity to review Chef Michael's dog food, I thought, ""Why not?""<br /><br />Results: She liked it! I was amazed. She ate the whole bowl. Based on likeability - I give it 5 stars.<br /><br />When I compared it to Blue, I do see a difference in nutritional value. Blue has 36% protein, 16% fat and 6% fiber. Chef Michaels' has 28% protein, 16% fat and 3% fiber. The difference is the amount of soy and corn products included in Chef Michaels. The first ingredient is beef, but after that, it contains soybean meal, soy flour, yellow corn, barley, etc. A lot of plant fibers. Blue on the other hand has Chicken, chicken meal, turkey meal, then vegetables like potatoes, peas, etc. Blue is grain-free. Based on nutritional value, I have to give it 3 stars.<br /><br />Blue is about $19.99 for a 4.5 lb bag; Chef Michael's is $11.99 for a 4.5 lb. Bag.<br /><br />Bottom line: If I want my dog to eat something besides deli turkey, I will continue buying Chef Michael's. At least she eats it. I will limit how much as I don't want her to get overweight. The cost may also be a significant factor for some buyers.<br /><br />UPDATE: One week later. My dog really likes this dog food, but she is having trouble adjusting to it and has loose stools. WIth Blue, her stools were never loose (when she ate it). I'll post later and let you know if and when she adjusts."
1,"I figured Nanuq would like this, but not quite to THIS level!  He's pretty much been eating it the moment it's served, rather than waiting until he's really hungry.  When my boyfriend put Nanuq's regular food in the dish along with the Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin, Nanuq was eating all right... but what disappeared was the Sirloin. All of his regular food was left behind!"
1,"I need to start by saying I have three dogs, a senior citizen golden retriever who will eat anything, a 7-year old pug who is somewhat of a picky eater and really likes moist food the most and last of all a 2 year old papillion that is a little princess who is quite the picky eater.<br />I just received this dog food today and put it out for their dinner tonight.  I always feed the youngest dog off by herself so that the big dogs don't disturb her.  She loves this food and ate every bit of it!<br />The two other dogs never looked up from their bowl until all the food was gone.<br />I'm telling you this stuff looks good enough to eat myself.<br />We as a family have discussed that this brand and flavor is now our ""go to"" food for our dogs at this house.<br />This is well worth your consideration....gave it a 5 star rating."
1,I have to be careful because my dog is 1. very picky and 2. he is diabetic. He loved it!  He usually eats canned food so I was not sure if he would like it. But it was a hit!  Will buy again!
1,"I have a large shepherd mix dog and she *hates* dry dog food.  She has refused all the dry dog food that I've ever bought.  I got this Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin to try and she LOVED it.  It doesn't look or smell like dry dog food usually does - it looks like pieces of real food and it smells like real food.  She gobbled it up like I was giving her steak, so this is definitely a dog food we will continue to buy!  It is a winner!"
1,"My old dog, who can be a bit of a princess, loves this stuff.  The ""sirloin"" bits are soft and chewy while the other bits are crunchy like traditional kibble.  My dog is big, but the bits are small enough that a very small dog would enjoy it as well.<br /><br />I usually wet my dog's kibble (she doesn't like it dry) and add a scoop or two of canned food.  With this, and because she isn't one of those dogs who immediately eats as much as is put down, I can free-feed her the food without it spoiling.<br /><br />So, it's a success with her.  With me, it's almost a success.  I'm not crazy that the food contains animal digest which, according to Wikipedia, can contain all sorts of things I don't want my dog eating, including product from dead, dying, diseased, or disabled animals.  Or roadkill, rats, animals euthanized in ""shelters.""  I don't know what this particular animal digest contains but that is part of the problem.  I want to know exactly what is in the food I give my animals.  Unfortunately, it is hard to find dog food that doesn't have something nasty in it.  And also unfortunately, this food isn't an exception to the rule."
1,"Even the most finnicky eater seems to really enjoy these doggie dinners.  Since I haven't tasted them, I can only extrapolate by the dog's enthusiasm that this a tasty dog food.<br /><br />One of the dogs who chowed down on this is a non-discriminating glutton-but even she seemed to like it better.  (Although with her, how can you tell?) Great to find it here-thanks Amazon!"
1,"My 2 dogs love this dry food,both the beef and the chicken. I mix it with Science Diet TD (vet only) dry food because it can get expensive. I usually buy 2 large bags at a time to save shipping, It is much less expensive on Amazon than the local retail store."
1,"I have an eight pound Chihuahua/Rat Terrier mix who will be eight years old this year.  I've tried many different kinds of dog food for her to no avail...and then there was Chef Michael's.  I finally found a dog food that she likes.  I mix one cup of Chef Michael's with 1/6th of Beneful Prepared Meals and she eats every bite.  My only problem with Chef Michael's is that it is hard to find in my area.  I would have to drive over 100 miles (round trip) to buy it so I order it thru Amazon.com, I'm a Prime member so shipping is free, and I get it in a couple of days.  If your dog is a fussy eater, try Chef Michael's.  I highly recommend it."
1,"I must say that in my dog's 2+ year lifetime so far, Chef Michael's Dry dog food is the ONLY food that my dog has liked more than once. We made a mistake and fed our dog human food for the majority of his lifetime, which he then developed an obvious taste for people food and would turn down any dog food we tried to feed him. We've tried tons of $$$ worth of dog food that he just sniffed and left, and Chef Michael's he actually eats when hes hungry.<br /><br />We went through two rotisserie chicken bags that he finished and now he's about halfway done with the beef one. I cannot tell which one my dog prefers but I would highly recommend to buy both of them to give yours a variety rather than just one flavor for their lifetime.<br /><br />I would 100% recommend this dog food for your dog. You can find it in your local supermarket (try different ones if one doesn't carry it) or obviously buy it on amazon."
0,"I am a vine reviewer, and a dog trainer. At first I liked the contents label, I liked the higher than regular protien content. I have shelties that eat purina one, or call of the wild. My shelties eat everything, like all dog foods.<br />So taste was not an issue, polished both bowls.I mixed the food with left over taste of the wild.<br />I noticed when I mixed the food I did not like the smell of the food, and I was wary of the meat bites, they looked very red.<br />After a week, both dogs have upset stomachs, and the poop is foul compared to the same protien level taste of the wild.<br />The garage started to smell really bad, I wondered if the cat had missed the litter box, no it was the food.<br />so I can not recommend this food."
1,My dog loves this stuff.  I have no idea of how good of food it is.  But the dog likes it so I am satisfied.
1,"If you feel like your dog should be fed with carefully prepared gourmet food, try Purina Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavor food with potato and green been garnishes.  This dog food is designed for adult dogs.  There are tender pieces of beef with kibble sizes of green beens and potato.  This 4.5 lb of dog food has a total of 23 essential vitamins and minerals.  Total ingredients are listed as 28% of protein, 16% of fat, 3% of fiber and 12% of moisture.  On the side of the bag, there is a recommended daily feeding guide.  This new product is trademarked by Nestle company and approved for distribution  is US by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO).  The complete ingredients list is quite extensive: from vitamin B-12 and D-3 to soybean, wheat flour to selenium to name a few.<br /><br />Dog food is packaged in a sturdy bag that will not break easily.  You will need scissors to open the bag.  You may want to store it in a container to preserve freshness or make sure you carefully fold it and close it at the end.  Excellent for special treat for your adult dog."
0,"I often wonder how much time is invested in making dog food look like something we feel better about giving to our pets. This food looks nice, different colors, 'meaty' looking moist chunks and my dog loves eating it.<br /><br />It's over $2 a pound so it should be great right?<br /><br />But, after reading up on the food at dog food advisor dot com I would never get this food again. It can be deceiving that beef is the first ingredient. But as it is explained in the review at dog food advisor, that is the weight of the beef before drying and processing - which contains a lot of water. So after processing, it is probably a much lower percentage of ingredient. Then there were other questionable ingredients including animal fat - the origin can be from a number of gross places, and a high corn meal content.<br /><br />So, I think much of the high price comes from the processing to make it look better to us and therefore make us feel better giving it to our dogs.<br /><br />I think I'm going back to my 4/5 star Kirkland dog food."
0,"The advertising is seductive.  A handsome young chef prepares a wonderful meal of quality food for his adorable little dog.  You too can do the same by buying his premium dog food.<br /><br />Unfortunately the food does not live up to the hype.  Even though beef is the first ingredient, the protein  count is boosted by plant ingredients, to wit, soy and corn gluten meal.  Additionally, it contains other questionable ingredients incuding animal digest (chemically hydrolized by products sprayed on the food to improve the flavor), chicken by products (essentially rendered slaughterhouse waste) and artificial colors. It also includes menadione which is a form of vitamin K suspected in allergies, liver toxicity and abnormal breakdown of red blood cells.  The food itself had little odor and an relatively attractive appearance. Luckily my dogs, who usually don't show the best judgment with their food choices,weren't too enthusiastic and only nibbled reluctantly.<br /><br />I believe what you feed your dog impacts his health. I have a few friends who actually prepare the food for their dogs but that is largely impracticle for me.  So I will continue investing in Fromms and Innova, both premium products.  Expensive, yes but worth it as an investment in the pet's health and well being."
1,"My dog has never met a dog food or a ""people"" food that he doesn't like (with the exception of pretzels). So, getting him to eat has never been an issue. What is an issue with this food is being able to get out of the way fast enough after I fill his bowl and place it on the floor for him to eat. While he hasn't told me in a language that I can understand, my belief is that he seems to enjoy his Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavor food almost as much as the ""people"" food my wife cooks for him.<br /><br />Besides the food's apparently good taste that my dog enjoys a lot, I like the fact that it has 23 essential vitamins and minerals, its meat pieces closely resemble pieces of steak in appearance and have a soft, easy-to-chew texture, and it has a pleasant aroma. While Chef Michael's has its fair share of soy and corn products, I'm satisfied that the Chef Michael's food provides my dog with a pretty well-balanced diet.<br /><br />All in all, I think your dog will thank you with lots of tail wagging and kisses after you start feeding him or her with Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavor food. By the way, I have also given my dog the Chef Michael's Chicken meal, which he also liked a lot."
0,"I think this dog food is a complete scam.  The bag claims ""well-rounded meals for adult dogs.""  This stuff is well-rounded only if you consider a fast food diet as a well-rounded diet.  Beef may be the first ingredient, but who knows what quality it is and it is directly followed by soybean meal, soy flour, preserved animal fat, brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, ground yellow corn, glycerin, poultry by-product meal, ground wheat, animal digest.  The list goes on of junk food for dogs with some artificial flavors and coloring added in also.  They are counting on pretty packaging with healthy claims distracting people from the actual ingredient list that contradicts those claims.  The feeding instructions say that you should feed your dog 1 cup for each 10 pounds of body weight, which means my 70 pound Lab would go through 7 cups of this junk food a day and at 22 cups of it a bag, would last her 3 days.  So this would not only be bad for her health but also bad for my wallet.  I can get a bag of quality grain-free food for her for significantly less than what it would cost me to feed her this for a month."
0,"Our dog was getting bored of his food, so we decided to give this a try. I was admittedly drawn to the ""Chef Michael's"" signature look of the bag. The higher price per pound seemed to lead me to assume that it contained dog food of higher quality than the typical grocery fare.<br /><br />Once this arrived, my dog DID enjoy eating it for a bit-just as I like eating a number of things that aren't good for me, and should eliminate from my own diet-or else suffer the consequences...<br /><br />However, the beautiful, brightly-colored packaging of Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog food (made by Purina) could not hide the ingredient list.<br /><br />The most obviously bad ingredients that jumped out at me was ""poultry by-product meal"" along with added colors (Red 40, Blue 2 and Yellow 5 &6).<br /><br />Beef does not belong as #1 (highest amount of ingredient)*Note:""pink slime"" is still listed as beef, even when fed to humans, which further erodes my confidence in the type/form of beef being used here.  Actually, this dog food is mostly comprised of SOYBEANS-as Soybean meal, soybean flour and soybean protein concentrate (listed #2, #3 & #5)., but is broken down into three different categories in order to make it seem like Beef deserves the top slot.<br /><br />I noticed a similar treatment regarding the use of corn (like soybeans, it's another GMO crop when not organic and also serves as a filler that's not great for dogs) is broken down to #6 corn gluten meal & #7 ground yellow corn. Another unhealthy filler for dogs Wheat-was also divided into ground wheat and wheat flour.<br /><br />I did learn a new term for #10, ""Animal digest"" - A material which results from chemical and/or enzymatic hydrolysis of clean and undecomposed animal tissue. The animal tissues used shall be exclusive of hair, horns, teeth, hooves and feathers, except in such trace amounts as might occur unavoidably in good factory practice and shall be suitable for animal feed. If it bears a name descriptive of its kind or flavor, it must correspond thereto.'<br /><br />Well, that's a lot of ingredients that scream ""junk food!""My vet already told me to severely limit or avoid giving my dog such things. It will shorten a dog's lifespan by contributing to a number of illnesses.<br /><br />I did notice dried beans and potatoes buried in the ingredient list. I think a much better option for me is to boil him a potato and stick it in his dish along with his regular dried food every now and then.<br /><br />Update:<br />I forgot to mention that I didn't completely change his food-I only put a few of those rubbery bits that look like meat in with his other dry food to encourage him to eat his regular stuff. Even that little bit has made his stool VERY pale and the smell (that usually only has a mild odor) is now VERY STRONG!"
1,"Technically this should be a 5 star rated product because dogs devour it.  But, it can be a huge problem if your dg is normally accustomed t more traditionl dry food.  It's almost as if this is like a kid eating too much candy.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, it's well made and dogs will like it - way too much.  So be careful; otherwise you'll have a problem transitioning back to regular dry food."
1,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:40 Mins<br /><br /></span>I was dog sitting for a dog named Bulleit and I wanted to test out this product on her. As the video shows, she enjoyed it. She was moderately hungry at the time.<br /><br />Some reviews have labeled this as ""junk food."" That's a bit unfair. Feeding your dog potato chips and other garbage is worse. This product certainly isn't the worst thing you can give your dog. It may not be the most nutritious dog food ever, but it's not junk food.<br /><br />I review for WanderLearn."
1,"My two dogs loved this! I agree that the ingredients are not much better than Old Roy, Walmart's brand, but my dogs loved it. Okay, they woofed it down so fast, I'm not sure they actually tasted it, but their bowls were so clean I just put them back in the cupboard because it's chili night here. ;o)<br /><br />Sheri Gill"
1,"How do I know if my dog loves this food?  He eats it right away and even after being in his pen for a few day and having the choice of an early mealtime or a romp with friends he picks the food.<br /><br />How can you tell with dogs?  We thought he loved his hard food with gravy.  But, he must wait until he see's we won't be putting any goodies into it or that he is really hungry because we still see it in his bowl the next morning.<br /><br />But, this is fairly expensive...even for our most precious Ben.  I think I just might be looking for a new dog food.<br /><br />This one seems to have lots of different flavors along with veggies offered.  He loved it."
1,"The dogs really like this and I have to say it looks so much better than the old ""brown orbs"" look of most dog food. It's a little pricey, so it doesn't work for larger dogs that eat a lot. But for medium sized dogs it seems like a winner."
1,This product is great new product.  It is healthy at a very reasonable cost.  Ruffus loves it.
0,"The ingredients in this dog food contain soy and corn which have about the same nutritional value as sawdust. Don't be fooled by the fancy label or celebrity jerks who promote this food. Dogs are not meant to eat grain (a little oatmeal or brown rice is sometimes okay). Typical of Purina dog foods, this is full of artificial dyes and cheap fillers. They get away with it because too many dog owners don't bother to look at the ingredients or educate themselves on dog nutrition. A dog who has constant gas or eats their own filth is not normal. A raw diet is best for dogs, but there is some decent kibble out there like Orijen, Natural Balance, and Merrick. This one is for the trash heap."
0,"I normally feed my dog a premium dog food where for his weight and age, I feed him about 2.5 cups a day and he is healthy and maintains his weight (lab/border collie mix). According to Purina and this product, I would need to feed my dog  6 cups of this dog food based on his weight. Just makes you go through the product faster and empty your wallet more often. Disappointing."
0,"There are several independent sites online that provide critical reviews of various dog foods.  Chef Michael's consistently receives the lowest rating possible.<br /><br />The main problem with this food is the numerous poor-quality ingredients.  Unspecified animal fat?  This can be restaurant grease, slaughterhouse waste, diseased cattle, etc.  Corn?  Hard for dogs to digest and of little nutritional value.  Poultry by-product meal? A dry rendered product of slaughterhouse waste that is not fit for human consumption, made up of things like beaks, feet, and feathers.<br /><br />Ignore the pretty packaging and the image of ""Chef Michael"" (who?) lovingly preparing your dog's meal in his kitchen.  This is stuff scraped up off the floor and pressed into bits.  Fido deserves better."
0,"I decided to try this food as part of the Vine Program for my schnauzer.  Manufacturers can say anything they want and the burden of proof is on you (the consumer).  In the end, what you choose to feed your dog boils down to whether the dog likes the food, the food's nutritional content and ingredients and the track record of the dog food manufacturer.<br /><br />I recently reviewed <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ0B0I"">PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound</a>, and this product contains a slightly better ingredient list.  However, the first ingredient is beef, followed by two fillers--soybean meal and soy flour, and the questionable tallow preserved in Vitamin E.  The rest of the ingredient list is similar to Beneful with respect to the other fillers: corn gluten meal and ground yellow corn and other unmentionables such as the ubiquitous poultry by-product meal and animal digest.<br /><br />As I said in another review, my schnauzer would eat almost anything, and this food was no exception.  Although I'm happy to see a reduction in the bad, bad things that are in Beneful, there are still plenty of fillers and potentially allergy inducing ingredients in this food.  I cannot in good faith recommend this food.  As with all dog foods, I recommend reading the labels on several different products if the ingredient list is something that bothers you (and I contend that it should).  While you will usually pay a little more up front for a quality dog food, the payoff will be increased longevity, vigor and vitality."
0,"When I saw this, I thought it would be rather appealing to dogs.  It looks as though it is full of taste and flavorful with the different tastes and textures combined.  When I filled my shih tzu's bowl with this, however, he simply looked at me, down at the bowl, gave it a sniff and walked away.  Granted, he is a very very very picky dog.  So far the only dog food that I have found that he really loves is Purina Beneful.  I have tried giving him this a couple of times and none of the times has he taken any interest in eating it.  Our cats, on the other hand, have nibbled on it and they don't seem to mind it.  I think this will end up going out to our big outside dogs - they love and eat anything, lol.  Bottom line, I will not be purchasing this in the future."
1,"Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food 4.5 Pound Bag<br />I have two dogs that I have fed this dog food to. Both of my dogs loved it and choose to eat it over their other dog food, I placed their regular food in one bowl and Chef Michael's in another (At different times for each dog).  They sniffed their regular food then went to this one and proceeded to gobble it up. I think this smells better than their regular dog food too which may be why they are so excited to have it to eat.<br /><br />Both of my dogs were extremely happy when it was time to eat, more so than with their normal dog food.<br />I think this would be a good alternative to their normal dog food because they seem to really love it.<br />This cost a little more money than the other brand that I buy but I think since they enjoy it so much I will look into future purchases of Chef Michael."
1,"I have a 12-year-old finicky beyond belief Shih-tzu and for the first time in her life I have found a dry food that she really likes. Well, she really likes the chewy meat shaped pieces. The crunchy green and yellowish kibble-like bits were not as appealing to her. In fact, I found myself picking up those pieces off the carpet because she takes a big mouthful from the bowl, then spits it all out and selects the pieces she wants to eat. The remainder is left on the floor for me to clean up.<br /><br />That said, in 4 out of 5 days of feeding, Lily has chosen the Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food over her favorite wet, canned food. I have been searching for years for a dry food that she would eat. You have no idea how many bags of food I've dropped off at the local animal shelter because Lily turns her nose up at everything...especially dry dog food. It looks like Chef Michael has cooked up a winner. This will be our go-to dog food from here on out. Or until Lily decides she doesn't like it anymore."
0,It was a surprise to me that she refused the green bits.  Guess she is like her owner my son. He is an Aspie and hates veggies and will not touch anything green. Our dog did not lke this.
0,"Sadie is our three-year-old GoldenDoodle.  I won't say she's a picky eater, but occasionally she turns up her nose at food that's supposed to be good for her, like Iams.  I was tickled that she loves Chef Michael's -- eats every bit as soon as it's in her dish.  I even mixed it with some of her regular food and she managed to pick out the Chef Michael bits and leave the regular food.<br /><br />But in the eight days that she's been eating this, she's had several loose stools and two accidents in the house -- her first accidents in all the time she's been housebroken.  Sadly, this yummy food is off her menu.  I'm no vet but there's obviously something in Chef Michael's that doesn't agree with her.<br /><br />Update: We stopped giving Sadie this food and there have been no more loose stools, or accidents in the house.  It may not have been related to the food at all -- there's no way to know without trying it again.  It's too bad, because she really, really liked it."
1,"I have a four year old sheltie.  He will basically eat almost anything.  So it's hard to tell exactly what he likes best.  He gobbled this up in his usual fast way and sniffed around the bowl in case anything fell out that he  missed, but of course he didn't find anything so I, being a bit indulgent, put a few more bits into his bowl and he happily<br />sucked them up, barely stopping to chew.<br /><br />Therefore, as far as taste goes, my dog liked these very much.  I must say that, some of the ingredients don't sound too great.  Lot's of corn and byproducts are included.  Danny's usual food is purchased from his vet, and includes both dry and canned food, along with meat and eggs several days a week and an occasional McDonald's cheeseburger, no pickles!<br /><br />I won't be buying this again due to the less than great sounding ingredients, but as far as Danny is concerned, it's just fine."
1,"When this arrived in the mail I started opening up the box it was shipped in and my dog was all over it, trying to get at it. It reminded me of Christmas when I get him treats in his stocking. I guess he thought it smelled very good. He was jumping around trying to see what I was opening. Once I fed him, he really ate it up. I am  happy to see him enjoy his food so much, as if it is a special treat instead of plain old dinner."
1,"I received a 4.5 Lb. bag of Purina Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavor and potato green bean garnish, well-rounded meals for adult dogs.  The package says that real beef is the #1 ingredient.<br /><br />The food is a mix of soft red dyed pieces and hard yellow and green dyed pieces.  The protein count is 28%, fat 16% and fiber 3%.<br /><br />Beef is the first ingredient, then soybean meal, soy flour and soy protein are all ingredients that are appropriate protein.  Brewers rice is the small pieces left over after the husk is milled.  Questionable ingredients include animal fat, which could come from anywhere, corn and corn gluten meal, poultry by products, the parts of poultry that are unfit for human consumption, and animal digest, again parts of any animal that is unfit for human consumption.  They also added food coloring, food dye.<br /><br />My dog is spoiled.  Her food is kept in a container in the pantry and anytime she gets hungry she goes in and paws the container to tell me that she is hungry.  With this food she has been asking for extra servings of food.  It isn't good to switch a dog to a new food so I mixed it with her regular food, but she loves it. She has had other soft type food and has not has this reaction to it.<br /><br />I keep my dog on a natural dog food without the questionable ingredients that Chef Michael's contains so I will not change to this full time, but I will include it for a treat now and then."
1,"Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food for adult dogs with potato and green bean garnishes is a hit with my dogs!<br />o The Crunchy kibbles and tender pieces appealed to them. They have taken to it very well and sought MORE PLEASE. ...This may be a cost savings compared to buying pouch or canned foods for mix-ins that encourage the dogs to eat less palatable offerings.<br />o Top 6 ingredients: BEEF, soy bean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with Vitamin E, brewer's rice, soy protein concentrate<br />...EXTENSIVE ingredient list...check the ingredients for items that cause your own dog problems.<br />o Product is a welcome addition to the Purina Dog Food range of products which historically contain corn as the main ingredient; a cause for digestion problems since it comes out pretty much the same as it went in.<br />...Haven't noticed any digestion or poop problems.<br />o Vitamin powder smell reminds me of when I had to add vitamins to my parents' show & hunting dogs' meals<br />...a positive addition.<br />o There are no artificial preservatives.<br /><br />o Prefer ziplock closure for the bag like some other dog foods.<br />o PRICE is moderatley MORE expensive @ $2.24 per pound.<br />...Let your budget be your guide IF this item is to be included in your dog's REGULAR daily menu. It will be an option but not an every day thing. EVERYONE in my house is belt-tightening!<br /><br />UPDATE 7/31/2012:<br /> 1. Using moist morsels as treats was very positive. Another reviewer shared the idea :)<br /> 2. Mixing Chef Michael's dog food with pooches' other dry dog food has them selectively picking out the moist<br />  morsels and eventually returning later to finish off the remaining grub ... too smart for their own good and<br />  lovable."
1,"I have two dogs, a very finnicky pug and and an extrememly easygoing Airedale. Both of my dogs loved this food. They gobbled it up as soon as a I put it in their bowl. It have a very cool texture, real pieces of meat, and quite soft. This is a great attribute for older dogs who may have problems with their jaws or teeth. I actually use the meat pieces as treats for my dogs. They really love this food! The price is a little high, but it's worth it if you want your dogs to eat their food with no issues. My dogs used to turn their noses up at other dog foods I've poured in their bowls, but not this stuff! Both of them very happily ate it up! I was very impressed with this dog. Neither of the dogs had an gastro issues from this brand either, if you get my drift. We are very happy with Chef Michaels Grilled Sirloin Dry dog food."
1,"My Dobie, Max, is as picky a dog as I have ever owned when it comes to eating his meals. I have tried most highly rated dry and canned food brands - Blue Buffalo, Wellness, Taste of the Wild etc. He refuses to eat any dry food unless I lace it with some chicken or beef or cheese to get him started. It is like priming a pump in that it takes just a small amount of what he considers a goodie to get him to usually finish his entire meal. Sometimes I would put some canned dog food in with the dry but he woud rarely eat it and after it sat there a while I would have to throw it away. That was an expensive and wasteful way to go so I stopped.<br /><br />When I received the Chef Michael's Sirloin I placed a small amount in my hand and offered it to Max. He went through his usual routine when offered something new by giving it the sniff test, throwing in on the floor to thoroughly examine it and then, if he likes it, scarfing it right up. He then gave me the old ""gimme more"" look but I did not fall for it. I cannot say with any certainty whether this product is healthy or, as some have declared, just plain junk food. I can say that Max loves this stuff. I have no intention of giving this to him as a meal but rather as an occassional treat mixed in with his regular food. If I notice any adverse effects or if his poop is altered then I will discontinue its use. The bag says it is manufactured by Purina and gives a US address but it is not clear if the address is just for the location of Purina or whether the food is actually manufactured in the US. I doubt that the food is made in the US because other Purina products and their web site are very careful to shield any source information. I am particularly careful on what I feed Max because his predecessor died of poisoned food from China.<br /><br />If this is junk food that is harmless when consumed in small amounts and not often then so be it. Who among us can honestly say they never ate any junk food? I don't feel that my life has been ruined by an occassional journey into junk food land. Neither my vet nor I believe any harm will come to Max from giving him a treat every once in a while."
1,"I have for some years now been feeding my dog a blend of appetizing dog foods with a costly prescription diet for his medical condition. He doesn't always have much of an appetite, and it can be difficult to coax him into eating much. He won't eat the prescription diet unless there's something a little more tempting with it. I don't know; maybe once he gets started he doesn't pay as much attention to the individual elements.<br /><br />On opportunity for review, I picked this up along with a bag of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ0B0I"">PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound</a> to see how these two foods would work for this purpose, and how they'd compare.<br /><br />Either of them does the trick. He was enticed by the smell of the Beneful before I even opened the bag. Put a few pieces on the floor, and he went after it like a dog in a dog food commercial. He gave pretty much the same attention to the Chef Michael's. He doesn't seem much to care which I put in the bowl with the prescription food; he has so far chowed down on each just as happily.<br /><br />Even allowing for the lower portion sizes of Chef Michael, it costs twice as much. Nutritionally, there are some differences between the pair. Beneful has 25% crude protein (minimum); 10% crude fat (minimum); 4% crude fiber (maximum) and a maximum of 14% moisture. Chef Michael has 28% crude protein (minimum); 16% crude fat (minimum); 3% crude fiber (maximum) and a maximum of 12% moisture. I've been doing some reading on dog food ingredients, and while I'm no expert what I've read suggests that the Beneful is heavy on carbs and, while its top protein source (chicken by product; second on the list) is a decent protein, it's not necessarily a highly digestible food due to its heavy reliance on corn. Chef Michael starts with beef. Corn is much lower on the list, but the second and third ingredients are soybean meal and soy flour. I'm told the first of these is mostly a filler, with little nutritional value, while the second loses much nutritional value being converted from grain to flour.<br /><br />That considered, I'm not sure that the Beneful would be my first choice for mixing in with my dog's food, although in the right proportion I feel comfortable enough with it. Chef Michael feels a little better, but is expensive and not necessarily a big nutritional win. With his tricky health, I don't think I would use either of these solely, but they both do the trick. While neither is exactly a health food, I can't pretend that everything I eat is the healthiest option, either. These are decent supplements, but I personally would not use them as mainstays."
1,"I put a bowl of this out next to our dog's other food, also Purina brand.  The dog clearly preferred this food and finished the entire bowl.  I found the food odd looking -- instead of typical little chunks of kibble, this food had pieces that look like meat, with scraggly edges and such.  I have no idea if dogs care what their food looks like -- but they did seem to enjoy eating this.  I wish the bag had a zip-lock closure, but other than that, no complaints."
1,"Forgive me ahead of time if this review gets into ""too much information"" territory, but yes, I'm going to discuss dog poop here. :-)<br /><br />I've had difficulty finding a dog food that:<br />a) my dog likes and<br />b) doesn't also cause what we call in our house...the dreaded Dog-arrhea!<br /><br />As a result of far too many clean ups - on the floor, on the carpet, on little dog feet, on our long-haired dog's posterior, I've stuck to a very boring but reliable kibble.  The result, she eats because she's hungry, but doesn't really enjoy it.<br /><br />Well, I can say that all that has changed!<br /><br />First and foremost, Chef Michael's dog food actually looks good.  Now, while I don't think the dog cares what the food looks like, it's still impressive for the doggie owner.<br /><br />Second, it actually smells good.  No dog food reek here.<br /><br />Third, the dog loves it.  From a dog who usually picks at her food, I now have a dog who devours her food.  LOL - as a matter of fact, I was awakened to the sound of the dog food bowl being pushed across the kitchen floor as someone looked for more food!<br /><br />And fourth and finally - the scoop on the poop!  I'm happy to say that the Dog-arrhea that usually comes with a change in food is non-existent.  Since I'm the one who has to scoop the poop before the gardener comes every week, let me just say that back yard clean up is a breeze.  And when the dog uses the pads on occasion, it's a super easy - and not at all smelly - clean up.<br /><br />So, with apologies for all the images this review may have brought to mind, but this is a really great dog food!"
1,"My dogs gobbled the food up in no time, but honestly what animal will not eat a new kind of food that is placed in front of them that smells and looks like beef.  It even states in the ingredients that natural filet mignon flavor is used.  It looks appealing with dry kibble and some moist chunks. In the ingredients it states by- product poultry is used, but I like that fact that beef is the first ingredient listed which means it is he highest concentrated ingredient used.<br /><br />I had previously purchased the ridiculously highly priced ""organic"" dog food, but after a recent very large recall of a well known dog food brand that has many labels, I switch to Purina brands since they have NEVER had a recall of dog food.  They have had recalls of cat food but never dog food.  However, for a 4.5 pound bag for a Purina brand dog food you can buy anywhere I think it is a tad bit expensive.<br /><br />I have been feeding my poochies <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FVTQJQ"">Purina Beneful Healthy Weight</a>, but I am going to mix things up and buy the large bag of Purina Beneful and a small bag of Chef Michael's and mix them up and feed them a smorgasbord every night."
0,"I normally feed my dog a semi-premium brand called 4Health which I get through Tractor Supply Co stores and my dogs love that food. It's the usual ""boring"" food, all the same shape and color, little round brown balls. So when I opened this bag of Chef Michael's and put some in their bowl they loved it! After all this is a change, but is it a good change? Like other reviewers I'm not impressed with the ingredient list. For the price it seems like there are far too many fillers in the food. And the food is a bit ""moist"" and in my experience working in a pet store dog food with moisture can easily start to bread mold and other bacteria. I'm not saying this bag had mold but it's a concern I have. My dogs did like this food, it's a nice treat for them but I think I'll stick with my current brand. Sure I'm paying about 25% more per bag when matching pound for pound but the food I feed them now doesn't contain the fillers, doesn't contain the coloring and doesn't have moisture built into it which creates some worry but also creates more weight so all in all it's less food when you consider it. Plus in my house my dogs don't do well with moist foods. It creates a mess on the back end if you know what I mean.<br /><br />I would pass on this, it's ok for the occasional treat or change if you want to mix it up a little bit (ensure you do so responsibly so you don't get your dogs sick), but I wouldn't make this a daily food for them."
0,They missed the mark here. This does not have any real ingredients. If you gave this to your dog as a treat it would be ok. This misses the mark for dogfood. My dog did gobble this down because it was something new. For my dogs overall health this does not work. I think that you should read the packaging then see what you think is good for your dog.
1,"I have a 2 year old chihuahua, and a 1 year old something.....my husband says it's Arnold Ziffle because she looks just like him.  Anyway, I put this in their dishes tonight and it was like watching a feeding frenzy of ravenous sharks.  Yeah, I think this stuff went over pretty well.  I even tasted it myself, after reading the ingredients of course.  The first on the list was beef followed by a lot of soy products and then somewhere about 1/5 down the list was CORN.  I thought it tasted pretty good too, except for the harder green pellet like things.  They had a very harsh soy aftertaste.<br /><br />Since both of my dogs are very small (even Arnold), I can afford to buy the more expensive dog foods to feed them.  And I very much prefer dry over canned or moist (though the reddish meaty granules in Chef Michael's were sort of chewy) to keep their teeth clean and white and they both apparently will wolf this stuff down.<br /><br />It's better than a lot of dog food, but worse than others of course.  But if your dog is finicky, it might like this stuff pretty good."
1,"There are quite a few negative on this product. So, before serving it to my Chow doggies I took this bag to my vet to see what he had to say about. All those complaints on here for nothing, according to my vet. He said this stuff has some really good ingredients in it and he didn't see much of anything that detrimental to a dog's longterm health and longevity. He said it does have some animal byproduct in it, which isn't the best, but isn't harmful. He said this dog food should be given mainly as a treat or reward from time to time and not for every meal. I probably won't be buying much of it because it is a bit pricey. My dogs absolutely love this stuff. They will eat this stuff about like I eat chocolate bars, if I allow them and myself to do so. Of course, there's not much my dogs won't eat. They are complete pigs and beg and beg at the table. We try to limit the amount of table food they get to only a couple of times a week. Sometimes though they give my wife and I the sad puppy dog eyes and we give in. What's funny, to me at least, is that Sirloin is my least favorite steak to eat, but most people love them. My dogs certainly do. If you can afford it's a great way to give your dogs a nice treat."
1,"I break this out as a treat when the family has a big barbecue and our nearly 2-year-old chocolate lab Sampo can barely contain himself, migrating from one person to the next begging for scraps and bones that might kill him. It's a nice, gourmet step up from his usual kibble, and he loves the heck out of it. Same goes for a much smaller dog, my friend's tiny little westie terrier Lucy; obviously she gets a lot less, but she has a lot of allergies and intolerances, and this food agrees with her in every way. You're probably hard pressed to find a dog who wouldn't go ga-ga for this tasty treat."
1,"Our dogs seem to have very broad tastes in dog food.  They were just as happy to eat this as their regular food, or any other dog food we've given them.  Given that this is almost certainly a bit pricier than what they normally get, this would have to be a special treat kind of thing for us.  It didn't seem to do anything special for them in terms of energy, coat, etc., but they really weren't on it long enough for a valid comparison.  If I had more money than human being should be allowed to have, this would certainly be a regular part of their diet, just because they seemed to like it so much."
1,"Our two aging Yorkies just love Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin.  It is generally understood that Yorkies are as picky as any dog can get.  Ours are no exception.  My neighbor's dog has gained a lot of anticipation from our excessive dog food.  We buy this product and ours turn their noses and walk away even when hungry.  NOT with Chef Michael's, however.  It is on the top of their LIKE list and when the bag comes out they are there with wagging tails and loving faces.  What more could an owner ask?  In an effort to eliminate another brand I thought I could fool them by mixing the Chef's with Brand X (a well known national brand) and alas dogs once again proved just how smart and selective they are.  Each of them assumed his and her eating position and began to literally push aside the Brand X food and rapidly consume the Chef's."
1,"There are two components of a review about dog food for me:  Do the dogs like it?  And is it good for them?<br /><br />To answer the first, my dogs LOVE it.  We had just finished a bag of feed so I opened this and they instantly started smelling the air as I poured it from the bag into their feed container.  From there I scooped out their usual quantity into each bowl and where they usually follow me with interest to where I set the bowls down for them to eat, this time they fairly pranced - leaping up and down with excitement at the ""treat"" that was in store for them.  On their old food, they would eat until they were full but often wander away with a little food left in the bottom to come back to later.  This time, they finished the bowl and then licked it clean.  So it certainly passed the taste test.<br /><br />Next is the question as to whether or not it is good for them.  I gave it a 4 because the overall ingredients are not terrible.  The first ingredient is meat - the first rule of thumb for me in any pet food.  However the second two ingredients are soy products, followed by brewers rice, more soy and then corn.  Included in the ingredients is also wheat.  So although it starts well, with Beef as the first ingredient, in the end it is bulked out by grains of all sorts, which lower the production costs for the manufacturer and keep the food priced lower for the consumer but also lowers the nutritional benefit to the animal.<br /><br />One last comment.  My first impression when I scooped the food into the bowls was that it is designed to look like a stew. Visually, it contains brown chunks - the meat - small green balls - the peas - and similarly sized yellow balls - the corn.  The problem is that a bowl of stew containing meat, peas and corn sounds yummy to us and is, in fact, designed to appeal to US visually - but is NOT a diet I would feed my dogs.  And, since dogs rely on smell more than vision, the visual appeal would be lost on them.  So I guess I didn't really appreciate what felt like a ""trick"" to get us to think of this as a good wholesome food for the dogs."
0,"My dog is a very picky eater and she loves this dog food so I thought I hit the jackpot. However, after looking at the ingredients I have found that I have NOT hit the jackpot. This dog food contians a lot of corn, wheat, and food coloring which I do not like but I can live with. The main ingredient I do NOT like though is the ANIMAL DIGEST and I cannot live with this being in my dogs food. I will NOT be giving my dog this food again. Chef Michael should be ashamed that he put his name on this dog food. I wanted to give this dog food one star BUT my dog did like it so I bumped it up to 2 stars but I will not give it any higher rating than that."
0,"The only thing that really bothers me about this dog food is the lengths they go to in order to dress it up as something more than it is.  It's a basic dog food, marginally better than plain old Purina Dog Chow, and does meet dogs' basic nutritional needs.  My dogs were happy to eat it (but they've never met a dog food they didn't like).<br /><br />However, as someone else noted, it is very cereal-heavy, including grains such as corn and wheat that many people prefer to avoid in their dog's food.  Calling it Grilled Sirloin doesn't mesh with its being primarily cereal.  That's like calling your bowl of Wheaties a milkshake because it has milk in it.<br /><br />The ""potato and green bean garnishes"" are just that, garnishes, on the order of a small twig of parsley on your plate.  Potatoes and green beans are near the bottom of the list of ingredients, if you don't count the many added vitamins (if the ingredients are so good, why are so many vitamins added to meet nutritional standards?), preservatives, and artificial colors.  What you see in the mix is extruded kibble dyed green and yellow, not actual pieces of vegetables.<br /><br />So, we have a bag of cereal called ""sirloin,"" with dyed green and yellow bits implied to be beans and corn, mixed with kibble extruded in a way that makes it resemble meat.  I wish they'd put more effort into the recipe and less into the disguise."
1,"Lets say I, a human has to write this review, and of course I  myself did not eat the dog food, our King Charles Cavalier Spaniels did.<br />Well at first they sniffed and looked at it for a few minutes, and then they ate it, but my dogs do that with some dog foods.<br />so for dog food, it must be pretty good as they (the dogs) seem to eat it.<br />It is a but pricey though."
1,"OMG, I must have died and gone to doggie heaven!  This dog food is de-e-e-lish!  It even beats the occasional, healthy, homemade tidbits my people put in my bowl.<br /><br />Now, I'm not your typical I-Eat-Anything doggie.  I'm particular and when I've eaten enough, I walk away from my bowl--even when there's still food in it.  But, this Chef Michael's is irresistible.  I didn't know dog food tasted so good.<br /><br />My family followed the directions on the bag, adding this new food to my old brand in small increments.  My tummy feels fine and my poop is normal so, what's not to like?<br /><br />Being an extremely intelligent fellow, I figured out how to eat only the Chef Michael's pieces and leave the old stuff in my bowl.  Of course, Dad tried to outsmart me and mixed it all up.  But, I showed him!  I even removed one piece of `yesterday's' brand and placed it at his feet.  Then I went back to my bowl, finishing my yummy feast.<br /><br />Oh, what's that?  I hear a bag crinkling...could it be DINNERTIME???  Gotta' run.<br /><br />`Chow', baby!"
1,"My dog absolutely went insane for this food.  It has sirloin bits, green bean bits and potato bits--it doesn't look like typical dry food.  I think he is eating better than I am!!  Even the fussy cat eats wants to eat this food.  I normally have to make sure the dog does not sneak food from the cat's dish but this is the first time I have had to worry about the cat sneaking food from the dog.  I don't have to be too careful because the food does not remain in the dog's dish very long since he likes this food so much.  It seems the only drawback would be the price."
0,"My dog is a 62lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix that repeatedly suffers from allergies, especially food allergies. He can also be a bit of a picky eater when it comes to his food so finding the right mix can often be difficult. While he loves just about any treat, I always have reservations about trying new food. Unfortunately, a large majority of popular dog foods today are filled with terrible ingredients not to mention carrying a high price tag. I'm always willing to try a new food so here are my thoughts on Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Dog loved it and gobbled it up.<br /><br />+ Some moist and tender food chunks along with the kibble.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Filled with tons of poor ingredients for your dog such as Soy, Chicken by-product, wheat, corn, artificial preservatives, flavors or colors. Artificial colors? Seriously? Do you really think the dog cares what color the food is when they eat it? Who are we trying to appeal to here, the dog or the person?<br /><br />- Expensive for a 4.5lb bag.<br /><br />My dog really enjoyed Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food.  However don't we all enjoy food that's bad for us? Unfortunately, that's exactly what this dog food is, bad for your dog. Someone said in a previous review if my dog was reviewing this food it would get 5 stars and my dog would agree with that. Lucky for him I know what's good for his health and Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food isn't it. With so many questionable and downright poor ingredients it's hard to really recommend this food for your dog. I definitely wouldn't purchase it again. Our current food is Nature's Domain Turkey Meal and Sweet Potato which is sold at Cost Co. It contains no potentially harmful ingredients, settles very well with my dog and is only $30 for a 25lb bag. If you're looking for a good healthy food, I recommend Nature's Domain brand or if you want to better educate yourself on what's actually in your current dog food I suggest visiting dogfoodadvisor.com. It's a great site that lists nearly all dog foods, breaks every ingredient and its properties down and gives a final overall rating on the food's quality."
1,"I don't know about your dogs, but my two (a Parson's Jack-mix and moyen Poodle) are nose driven when it comes to chow.  Consequently it is VERY important that I be able to keep their food fresh and odor-ful.  Chef Michael's dog food isn't resealable.  And that's a big one-star drop for me.<br /><br />As far as APPEARANCE it's okay.  The meaty-looking bits look like giant rough extruded fake-bacon bits.  And they are interspersed with green and light brown veggie looking bits.  My dogs don't like the latter, at all.<br /><br />The ODOR isn't all that pleasant to me, but it's not a problem because I can't smell the kibble until my nose is right in the bowl.  My little Jack seems drawn to the smell.  Rodger-Pippin isn't so sure.<br /><br />My final STAR-DROP came from the use of ""Animal Digest"".  On the surface of it, Animal Digest doesn't sound so bad.  It's a broth made from animal parts.  However, the 'parts' can be anything, including road-kill, and since Purina gets many of their ingredients from China I don't think I'd be comfortable with feeding my family's beloved members this food on a longterm basis.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom & fur-mom"
1,"I am babysitting a neighbor's dog; his elderly wife is unable to handle him (while he is older, but overweight - now getting back in shape); her husband is now in a different Assisted Living Facility Home for Therapy before coming home. I have 2 differing Purina's brand, one which he practically went crazy over (that which my cats thought were their food) - with 2 cups in 2 different bowls ... he did not like this one at all. Added some warm beef broth and made a gravy with this to see if he would eat it, instead, he flipped the bowl over completely and made a mess. He did not like this period - dry or gravy-like. So I went to my neighbor's house who has a Mixed-Breed Peki-Terrier; and the Owners put him down and at first he tilted his head ... oh he practically devoured it! When added with a little warm water for a gravy-like treat; he just went literally nuts!<br /><br />Took this down for some other Dog Reviews:<br /><br />Down to the neighbor's around the corner:<br />Rotweiller: Snubbed it instantly without any hestitation<br />German Shepherd snarfed it up and ate the Rotweiller's too and wanted more!<br /><br />Went to another neighbor's home who has 3 dogs:<br />English Bull Dog: Did not like with or without gravy mix<br />Pit Bull Mix: Unsure at first; after a few bites - then gobbled it up with tail wagging but wanted to play rather than eat.<br />Greyhound: Wasted no time trying to eat before it was poured into the bowl first! *laughing*<br /><br />Another Neighbor's House:<br />Brown (light) Chow-Chow: tipped bowl over and walked off<br />Black Chow Chow: YUMMY! Even ate off the ground that his sister tipped over and begged for more; tail was wagging like a mad maniac!<br /><br />Last Neighbor's House:<br />Great Dane: finished the entire bag off and stuck head in bag looking for the last kibble, was disappointed; tail was wagging like crazy!<br /><br />There's your Dog Reviews - pretty much most of the Dogs Loved It while a few didn't."
1,"My Chinese Crested dog is picky.  She has an easily upset stomach too.  Her response to this food was surprising, she really likes it.  More important is that she can eat this food without getting an upset stomach.  Normally I have to feed her Salomon based foods, intended for dogs with weak stomachs, but this food seems to really work for her.  Highly recommended."
1,"I have two min. schnauzers and they tend to be picky eaters.  I was a little reluctant to try this, but am glad I did. They really seem to like Che Michael's!  Thank you Amazon. And having the convienence of having the dog food delivered to the front door is so great!"
1,"I convinced my sister to stop feeding her dog <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ0B0I"">PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound</a>, after reading the ingredients in it.  She tried this one next.  It had a much better ingredients list, but her dog did not like it.  I believe because her dog is use to eating chicken or lamb.  The Beneful was the only beef dog food he had eaten in a long time, and there was so little beef, he probably didn't even taste it. I told her there was <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJO8T6"">Chef Michael's Oven Roasted Chicken Dry Dog Food 11.5 Pound Bag</a>, but she instead let her husband choose the next bag of food. He bought something very expensive that had New Zealand lamb as the number one ingredient, and had absolutely no corn. The dog loves it."
1,"Great big bag of Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dog Food.  Frank absolutely loved this food.  She goes to her bowl everynight at dinner time.  She would even go back later in the evening & sit there like I didn't feed her yet.  Great little bites.  It was hard to find in stores at first, but now no problems.  Frank has been eating this food for about 5 months now with no troubles."
0,"The quick way to evaluate any dog food is to look at the first ingredients in ingredients list. For Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food, we have these as the first eight components:<br /><br />Beef<br />soybean meal<br />soy flour<br />animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of vitamin E)<br />brewers rice<br />soy protein concentrate<br />corn gluten meal<br />ground yellow corn<br /><br />... This is not a good list. Beef will shrink and lose its water after cooking. Soybean meal and soy flour boost the protein level, but provide less quality to this food than would actual meet. Animal fat could be any sort of gross restaurant or slaughterhouse leavings, according to the DogFoodAdvisor website. Brewers rice, soy protien concentrate, corn gluten meal and ground yellow corn are all immediate red flags of little nutritional value to a dog.<br /><br />As with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009JRUT6"">Purina Beneful Healthy Radiance, 7-Pounds</a>, this is yes beautifully packaged, but not really that good for your dog. I'll stick with the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFIY92"">Verus Life Advantage Chicken Meal, Oats And Brown Rice Formula Dry Dog Food</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFSBC2"">Verus Advanced Opticoat Diet Menhaden Fish Meal And Potato Formula Dry Dog Food</a>"
1,"My pomerian is very picky at what he wants to eat. He LOVED this dog food. The bag is big enough to last him three weeks. It is a great value.  I personally think the blend of soft and hard food is great for dogs, if yours is a picky eater I suggest this dog food for them highly"
1,"I have a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel... about 5.5 years old and about 13-14 pounds.<br /><br />He's got bad teeth (a few have actually fallen out) and even in his younger years he didn't like eating normal-sized dog food, preferring the smaller stuff for puppies.<br /><br />I got this from the Amazon Vine program, and when I saw how big the pieces were, I figured he wouldn't like eating it (pieces too big). However -- to my surprise -- he loves this food. He scarfs it down immediately as though it were a treat instead of his regular food.<br /><br />This stuff smells a little more meaty and more 'appetizing' than the Science Diet I was feeding him before. You can tell this is high quality as far as dry dog food goes. The proportion of chewy pieces to dry pieces is also high... at least half of the food is composed of the chewy pieces, which my dog loves.<br /><br />I can't speak for other people's pets, but mine loves this stuff. I've never seen him enjoy a dry food this much, and will probably be switching to this from now on. 5 Stars."
1,"My dogs tend to have sensitive stomachs and many dog foods cause them to get sick. We tried to Costco brand and we had trouble, so I was hesitant to try Chef Michael's. But, I hated to keep buying the dog food from the vet. They are so expensive! When I opened the bag and was surprised that it didn't have that odor that many dog foods have. It actually smelled kind of good. The true test would be how my dogs liked it and if it caused gas and an upset stomach. They ate the food up immediately and were searching for more. Fortunately,Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin didn't upset their stomach one bit! No gas, good solid poop and happy dogs! My only complaint is that the bag doesn't have a gripper seal. I had to find another container to keep it in, which is a bit of a bummer, but I'd much rather find a container than clean up after a sick dog. I'll be sure to get this food again in the future."
0,"On the outside, it's great that my dog seems to enjoy this food. However, there is no reason to buy this food for your dog, knowing that there is by product, corn gluten, and animal digest. Despite the price, I would not recommend this dog food to any dog owner, especially with the by product.<br /><br />By product may consist a variety of (via Dogadvisor[dot]com)<br /><br />Feet<br />Backs<br />Livers<br />Lungs<br />Heads<br />Brains<br />Spleen<br />Frames<br />Kidneys<br />Stomachs<br />Intestines<br />Undeveloped eggs<br /><br />It is unacceptable to use animal waste into dog food.<br /><br />I recommend brands that do not use animal by-product at all: Blue buffalo, natural choice, innovo.<br /><br />Get your act together, Purina. Ditch the cheap, easy way of production and use quality ingredients."
1,"Our dog would not try this at all.  No enticement could get her to put one piece of this dog food in her mouth.  She just didn't like it.<br /><br />Now our neighbor's dog absolutely LOVED this dog food.  Ate it up quickly and wanted more.  I don't know why our dog wouldn't even sniff it.<br /><br />This dog food has an interesting texture; it's not just plain, hard dog kibble.  This looks different, like real meat bits.  I like the look of it.<br /><br />Too bad our dog didn't like it.  Oh, well.  But, I'm glad our neighbor's dog liked it.  So, beats me why some dogs will go for some dog food and some will not.<br /><br />I'm giving this 4 stars because it seems a well made product and I like that it has both tender and crunchy pieces.  Plus my neighbor's dog is now my best friend because of this dog food.  Rex loves it!"
1,Hard to rate dog food if you don't eat it!  My dog loves these and I actually use these as treats rather than food.  Saves me lots of money over those expensive dog treats.  The texture feels like ground beef... and it doesn't smell too bad.  I wish the bag was resealable.
1,One of the few dog foods my dogs eat dry!  And the auto-ship feature is wonderful...no more running out of food and I don't have to carry in the bags.  Yey!
1,"Never mind that this dog food is kind of gross looking - my dogs just love it!  While they do not exactly have  refined palates, they do know what they like.  For those with smaller dogs (I have a Yorkie and a teacup Yorkie), you really need to cut some of the pieces up a bit smaller, as they can be pretty large and my teacup has a hard time getting them into her mouth.  My other two large dogs have no problem and just scarf it on down!"
1,"My dogs are not picky; they generally eat whatever kibble I put in front of them. There are many reviews above that list chapter and verse of what is healthful and what is not regarding dog food. Just like with humans, there are a variety of camps regarding more or less meat, grains, etc... My dogs enjoyed this food and ate it right up. That said, this product is pretty expensive per pound but here is where it could really come in handy: If you have a dog with a tender mouth (say dental problems or such) this food would be a lifesaver for someone who doesn't want to mess with canned food. If your dog is a slow eater or a nibbler this would be a great alternative to nasty canned food sitting around. I don't like canned pet food because it gets nasty after sitting, and it can be hard to clean the dish or the floor around it. This is a neat option versus canned food."
1,My dog doesn't always like new food.  I think she really liked this Chef Michael's food. I checked out the ingredients and it along w/ meat for protien and veggies it says it contains 23 essential vitamins and minerals.  It also contains cruncy kibble. I can't taste it so of course I was relying on my dog's willingness to eat it when put in her bowl. I must admit the thing that I loved the best was that it didn't stink like most dog food/kibble.  Dry dog food really stinks to me no matter what brand I've tried but this didn't have that stinky smell. I give this a thumbs up and will be trying it out. Haven't checked the price to compare to others but as long as it's not double the price I will be purchasing another bag.
0,"Unless you are already feeding your dog a low end dog food, Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin is not something I'd recommend feeding to your pet.<br /><br />I try to feed our dog better grade dog food.  Right now he is eating Castor and Pollux Natural Ultramix.  There are several other high quality pet foods available.<br /><br />If you'd rather skip this review and are looking for a better quality dog food, there are several out there, some of which strive to serve ""natural/organic"" products.  Here are justa few, listed alphabetically:  Blue Buffalo, Castor and Pollux, Merrick (who recently merged with Castor and Pollux), and Wellness.<br /><br />Chef Michael's is a Purina product.  While not trying to malign Purina, I am not aware of any better quality dog foods they produce.<br /><br />The ingredients, in order, directly from the label:<br />Beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, ground yellow corn, glycerin, poultry by-product meal, ground wheat, animal digest, pearled barley, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, salt, grilled sirloin steak flavor, dried green beans, dried potatoes, sulfur, Vitamin E supplement, choline chloride, zinc sulfate, ferrous sulfate, added color (Red 40, Blue 2, Yellow 5, Yellow 6), niacin, wheat flour, potassium chloride, L-Lysine monohydrochloride, manganese sulfate, Vitamin A supplement, calcium pantothenate, thiamine mononitrate, copper sulfate, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin B-12 supplement, pyridoxine hydrochloride, garlic oil, Vitamin D-3 supplement, folic acid, calcium iodate, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), biotin, sodium selenite. C-5900.<br /><br />Nothing against beef for my dog, so it doesn't start out bad.  But after that....soybean meal and soy flour are just ""protein fillers"".  The next largest ingredient is animal fat.  Animal fat can come from numerous sources, including rodents, diseased animals, and you really just don't know the source.  After that, there are several grains, many of which do not provide any nutritional value for a dog, like corn. This dog food also contains poultry by-products.  Any by-product is typically bad:  it can be various parts of animals, heads, feet, beaks. Some people point to its protein concentration, but in general meat and poultry by-products should be avoided.<br /><br />There is also artificial coloring in the food.  Not that there is necessarily anything horrible with this, but it is dog food, so why add something which has no value and could potentially be harmful to the dog?<br /><br />So what is there to like about this product?  As a dog food, really not much.  But, dogs do seem to like the taste, so, like junk food for humans, maybe a little bit in moderation can be used as a treat.  The food consistency is ""chewy"" so I squeeze together a couple of pieces and give it to my dog as a ""candy"" treat.<br /><br />Sadly, the price of this dog food is not so low as to make it such a value by weight as to draw people to buy it.  For this 4.5 pound bag, for the same price per ounce, you can buy a much better dog food. Even when buying a larger bag of this product, it is not that much less per ounce than better quality dog food.  When you factor in that it's got a lot of low quality ingredients, it is not a better bargain at all."
1,I often take care of my sister's dogs and recently I tried out this product.  I mixed it with their regular food and they picked out all of the Chef Michael's pieces and ate those first!  When those pieces were gone they reluctantly ate their other food.  Needless to say it was a hit with them.
1,"I like this dog food because they claim to have No added artificial preservatives and the #1 ingredient is beef, so it appears that the dog food would be better for your dog then a lot of the ones you can get in the stores.  My dog seemed to enjoy it as well.  I am sceptical of all the things they put in dog food, but I have a dog that doesn't tolerate ""real"" food well, so if you have to give him a dog food, this doesn't seem too bad."
1,"First the dogs love it, this food must smell great, taste great, and have a texture that the animals really enjoy. If you have a dog that is a picky eater then you might give this a try.<br /><br />As to the issues with a lot of the ingredients being secondary use or byproducts.<br />I am not a processed food expert, I do see that the number one ingredient is beef and I generally assume that animal food is made using safe secondary use food products which seems ok to me. We take the best cuts of beef and put them on the grill, next we grind up the next best to make our burgers, lunchmeat, and sausage, perhaps some of that same product as well as what is left goes to the animals we care for, should we just throw it all away instead? We pull oils and milk from soybeans to cook with and to make tofu. What happens to the fiber? We feed it to animals. Since we as humans eat whole soybeans I have to imagine that eating the fiber and remaining protein is not a terrible thing.<br /><br />Certainly all animals and humans have some allergies and digestive issues. Some people can't drink milk and some animals apparently don't do well with soy we don't seem to have an issue in our house. If your dog has issues and needs rice or something else then you should pick another food for them. If you have a healthy food that the dogs don't love, sprinkle a bit of this on top and perhaps you will have luck getting them to eat the less flavorful and perhaps healthier food with this addition. However this may be all you need to feed as according to Purina ""Animal feeding tests using Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) procedures substantiate that Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavor and potato & green bean garnishes provides complete and balanced nutrition for maintenance of adult dogs."""
1,I am going to be using this product for the candy buffet at my wedding in September. The transaction was easy and fast. Thank you!
1,"I forgot chocolate had a low melting point, and when I got it, the temperature was about 92 degrees Fahrenheit. The mailman even put it in my black mailbox. Needless to say, it melted. But, I put it in the freezer and it was just fine! Very good! But, don't buy chocolate online."
1,"Taste-wise, these are pretty decent.  I found that I got tired of the orange flavor that is added.  I remember liking them a bit more when I was younger."
